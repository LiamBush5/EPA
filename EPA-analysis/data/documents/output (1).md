# Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

Both the EPA and the NH DES signed the MoA in which the parties agreed to the terms and conditions regarding the responsibility to implement and enforce the policies, responsibilities and procedures of the SSI Federal Plan. The MoA became effective upon signature by the EPA on December 22, 2017.

Under the EPA’s Delegation Manual, item 7–139, the Regional Administrator is authorized to delegate implementation and enforcement of sections 111(d)/129 Federal Plans to state environmental agencies. The Regional Administrator may consider delegating authority to implement and enforce Federal Plans to a state provided the following conditions are met: (1) The state does not already have an EPA approved State Plan; (2) the state submits a demonstration of adequate resources and legal authority to administer and enforce the Federal Plan; and (3) the state enters into a MoA with the Regional Administrator that sets forth the terms, conditions and effective date of the delegation and that serves as the mechanism for the transfer of authority.

NH DES has met all of the EPA’s delegation requirements as described above. The reader may view the NH DES letter to the EPA requesting delegation and the MoA signed by both parties at www.regulations.gov, identified by Docket ID Number EPA–R01–OAR–2018–0069.

# IV. What is the EPA’s proposed conclusion?

The EPA has evaluated the NH DES submittal for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. The NH DES has met all the requirements of the EPA’s guidance for obtaining delegation of authority to implement and enforce the SSI Federal Plan. The NH DES entered into a MoA with the EPA, and it became effective on December 22, 2017. Accordingly, the EPA is proposing to approve the NH DES request dated November 14, 2017 for delegation of authority to implement and enforce the Federal Plan for existing SSI units. The EPA will continue to retain certain specific authorities reserved to the EPA in the SSI Federal Plan and as indicated in the MoA (e.g., authority to approve major alternatives to test methods or monitoring, etc.).

# V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a state plan submission that complies with the provisions of the CAA section 111(d) and 129(b)(2) and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7411(d) and 7429(b)(2); 40 CFR 62.02(a).

# Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

ACTION: Proposed rule.

# SUMMARY:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is proposing to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. This proposed change, once finalized, would benefit the wide variety of establishments generating and managing hazardous waste aerosol cans, including the retail sector, by providing a clear, protective system for managing discarded aerosol cans. The streamlined universal waste regulations are expected to ease regulatory burdens on retail stores and others that discard hazardous waste aerosol cans; promote the collection and recycling of these cans; and encourage the development of municipal and commercial programs to reduce the quantity of these wastes going to municipal solid waste landfills or combustors.

# DATES:

Comments must be received on or before May 15, 2018. Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), comments on the information collection provisions are best assured of consideration if the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) receives a copy of your comments on or before April 16, 2018.

# I. General Information

# A. Does this action apply to me?

This proposed rulemaking would affect persons who generate, transport, treat, recycle, or dispose of hazardous waste aerosol cans, herein referred to as aerosol cans, unless those persons are households or very small quantity generators (VSQGs). Entities potentially affected by this action include over 18,000 industrial facilities in 18 different industries (at the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code level). Most of these industries have relatively few entities that are potentially affected. The two top economic sectors (at the 2-digit NAICS code level) with the largest percentage of potentially affected entities are the retail trade industry (NAICS code 44–45), representing 65% of the affected Large Quantity Generator universe, and Manufacturing (NAICS code 31–33), representing 20% of the affected Large Quantity Generator universe. Potentially affected categories and entities include, but are not necessarily limited to:

# B. What action is the agency taking?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the list of universal wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), 42 U.S.C. 6921(a), 6921, 6922, 6924, and 6926.

# C. What is the agency’s authority for taking this action?

These regulations are proposed under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3001, 3002, 3004, and 3006 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. This proposed change, once finalized, would benefit the wide variety of establishments generating and managing aerosol cans, including the retail sector, by providing a clear, practical system for handling discarded aerosol cans.

# D. What are the incremental costs and benefits of this action?

This proposed action, if finalized as proposed, is expected to result in an annual cost savings of $3.0 million to $63.3 million. Information on the estimated future economic impacts of this action is presented in Section VII of this notice, as well as in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) available in the docket for this proposed action.

# 11656 Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

that the expected cost savings is based on the assumption that all eligible states would adopt regulatory changes, once they are finalized. EPA requests comment on this assumption.

In addition to cost savings, EPA’s analysis shows qualitative benefits to adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program, including improved implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste program and increased recovery and recycling of aerosol cans.

# II. Background

# A. Description of Aerosol Cans

Aerosol cans are widely used for dispensing a broad range of products including paints, solvents, pesticides, food and personal care products, and many others. The Consumer Specialty Products Association (CSPA) estimates that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015 for use by commercial and industrial facilities as well as by households.

A typical aerosol can consists of several components, including (but not limited to): (1) The can or container storing both propellant and the product; (2) an actuator or button at the top of the can that is pressed to deliver the product; (3) a valve which controls delivery or flow of the product; (4) the propellant (a compressed gas or liquefied gas), which provides the pressure in the container to expel or release the product when the actuator is pressed to open the valve; (5) the product itself; and (6) a dip tube which is connected to the valve to bring the product up through the can to be released when the actuator is pressed.

The can itself is typically a small steel or aluminum container, designed to be hand-held, which is sealed with its contents under pressure. The can’s design is intended to prevent unwanted releases of the contents to the environment under normal handling and storage conditions. However, when aerosol cans are mismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting increase in internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of bursting, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far above ambient environmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and be forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as a result of overheating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents of the can may readily catch fire as they are released and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor “fireball”; (2) the bottom of the can may detach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing the upper part of the can to become a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it bursts, releasing metal shards.

# B. Current Federal Regulation of Aerosol Cans

# 1. Regulation of Aerosol Cans Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

Any person who generates a solid waste, as defined in 40 CFR 261.2, must determine whether the solid waste qualifies as hazardous waste. The waste may be hazardous either because it is listed as a hazardous waste in subpart D of 40 CFR part 261 or because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste, as provided in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261. As discussed above, aerosol cans are frequently hazardous due to the ignitability characteristic, and in some cases may also contain listed or exhibit other hazardous waste characteristics.

# 2. Regulation Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)

Hazardous waste aerosol cans that contain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance with the instructions on the label. In general, the statement on aerosol pesticide product FIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of the cans. However, in April 2004, EPA first explained this interpretation in 1993.

# Footnotes

5 Under 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1), “household waste” means any material (including garbage, trash and sanitary wastes in septic tanks) derived from households (including single and multiple residences, hotels and motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds and day-use recreation areas).

6 EPA first explained this interpretation in 1993. See U.S. EPA 1993 Regulatory Status of Used Residential And Commercial/Industrial Aerosol Cans, Memo from Jeff Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste to John DiFazio, Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association, October 7, 1993. RO #11780.
---
# Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

issued a determination that puncturing aerosol pesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore lawful pursuant to FIFRA section 2(ee)(6) provided that the following conditions are met:

- The puncturing of the container is performed by a person who, as a general part of his or her profession, performs recycling and/or disposal activities;
- The puncturing is conducted using a device specifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any emissions thereof; and
- The puncturing, waste collection, and disposal, are conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local waste (solid and hazardous waste) and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.

EPA anticipates that this 2004 FIFRA determination would not be affected by the proposed addition of hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste rules.

# C. Retail Strategy and Aerosol Cans

The retail sector as a whole handles a very large number of diverse products, which change over time and may, in many instances, become regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA when discarded. As a result, retailers are required to make hazardous waste determinations for a variety of products being discarded at stores located across the country.

In 2014, EPA published a Notice of Data Availability (NODA) for the Retail Sector as part of the Agency’s continuing efforts to better understand concerns from all stakeholders regarding RCRA’s applicability to the retail sector, as well as to obtain information and feedback on issues affecting the retail sector. (79 FR 8926, February 14, 2014) In the NODA, EPA requested comment on a series of topics related to retail operations, waste management practices and management of materials that may become hazardous waste when discarded. This specifically included requests for information regarding aerosol cans (e.g., quantity generated, classification and management options, including handling as universal waste), since aerosol cans comprise a large percentage of the retail sector’s hazardous waste stream. Approximately 35% of NODA commenters specifically suggested that discarded aerosol cans be managed as universal waste.

# D. Universal Waste Rule

In 1995, EPA promulgated the universal waste rule (60 FR 25492, May 11, 1995) to establish a streamlined hazardous waste management system for widely generated hazardous wastes as a way to encourage environmentally sound collection and proper management of the wastes within the system. Hazardous waste batteries, certain hazardous waste pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and hazardous waste lamps are already included on the federal list of universal wastes. The universal waste regulations in 40 CFR part 273 are a set of alternative hazardous waste management standards that operate in lieu of regulation under 40 CFR parts 260 through 272 for specified hazardous wastes.

Handlers and transporters who generate or manage items designated as a universal waste are subject to the management standards under 40 CFR part 273, rather than the full RCRA subtitle C regulations. Handlers include both facilities that generate universal waste and facilities that receive universal waste from other universal waste handlers, accumulate the universal waste and then send the universal waste to another handler, a destination facility or a foreign destination. Handlers do not include facilities that treat, dispose of, or recycle universal waste except as provided in the universal waste regulations. The regulations distinguish between “large quantity handlers of universal waste” (those who handle more than 5,000 kilograms of total universal waste at one time) and “small quantity handlers of universal waste” (those who handle 5,000 kilograms or less of universal waste at one time). The 5,000-kilogram accumulation criterion applies to the quantity of all universal wastes accumulated. The streamlined standards allow for puncturing and draining of aerosol cans by universal waste handlers.

# E. State Universal Waste Programs That Include Aerosol Cans

Four states, California, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, already have universal waste aerosol can programs in place, and two more states, Ohio and Minnesota, have proposed to add aerosol cans to their universal waste regulations. The universal waste programs in all these states include streamlined management standards similar to 40 CFR part 273 for small and large quantity handlers of universal waste, and a one-year accumulation time limit for the aerosol cans. In addition, the four current state universal waste programs, as well as Ohio’s proposed regulations, set standards for puncturing and draining of aerosol cans by universal waste handlers.

was waste handlers, as long as specific comments on the 2014 Retail NODA,¹¹ generation. For example, a retail store management standards and waste characterization requirements are met. In addition, California does not allow off-site commercial processors¹⁰ to puncture and drain aerosol cans without a permit, and requires those handlers that do puncture and drain cans to submit a notification. Minnesota’s proposed rule would not allow handlers to puncture and drain their aerosol cans.

# III. Rationale for Proposing Aerosol Cans Be Managed Under the Universal Waste Rule

EPA is proposing to add aerosol cans to the universal waste rule, because the Agency believes that this waste meets the factors that describe hazardous waste that is appropriate for management under the streamlined universal waste system. Adding aerosol cans to the universal waste rule simplifies handling and disposal of the wastes for generators, while ensuring that aerosol cans are sent to the appropriate destination facilities, where they will be managed as a hazardous waste with all applicable subtitle C requirements. Management as universal waste under the proposed requirements is also expected to facilitate environmentally sound recycling of the metal used to make the cans. The universal waste regulations include eight factors to consider in evaluating whether a waste is appropriate for inclusion in the universal waste rule. These factors, codified at 40 CFR 273.81, are to be used to determine whether regulating a particular hazardous waste under the streamlined standards would improve overall management of the waste and, therefore, whether the waste is a good candidate for the universal waste rule. As the Agency noted in the preamble to the final universal waste rule (60 FR 25513), not every factor must be met for a waste to be appropriately regulated under the universal waste system. However, consideration of all the factors should result in a conclusion that regulating a particular hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 273 will improve waste management. EPA has examined information on aerosol cans, including information submitted in the public comments on the 2014 Retail NODA.

# A. Factors for Inclusion in the Universal Waste Rule

1. The Waste, as Generated by a Wide Variety of Generators, Should Be a Listed or Characteristic Hazardous Waste (40 CFR 273.81(a))

As discussed in Section III, aerosol cans frequently demonstrate the hazardous characteristic for ignitability (40 CFR 261.21) due to the nature of the propellant used. In addition, the contents (propellant or product) may also cause the can to be a hazardous waste for other reasons if discarded.

2. The Waste, or Category of Waste, Should Not Be Exclusive to a Particular Industry or Group of Industries, But Generated by a Wide Variety of Establishments (40 CFR 273.81(b))

EPA has documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) developed for this proposal, that large and small quantity generators that manage hazardous waste aerosol cans can be found in 18 different industries (at the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code level). Thus, aerosol cans are commonly generated by a wide variety of types of establishments, including households, retail and commercial businesses, office complexes, very small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial facilities.

3. The Waste Should Be Generated by a Large Number of Generators and Frequently Generated in Relatively Small Quantities (40 CFR 273.81(c))

As documented in the RIA, more than 18,000 large and small quantity generators manage hazardous waste aerosol cans. Quantities generated vary depending on the type of generator and the situations associated with.

4. Systems To Be Used for Collecting the Waste (Including Packaging, Marking, and Labeling Practices) Should Ensure Close Stewardship of the Waste (40 CFR 273.81(d))

The baseline universal waste requirements of notification, labeling, training, response to releases found in 40 CFR part 273 subparts B and C and the proposed specific requirements for management of aerosol cans in 40 CFR 273.13 and 40 CFR 273.33 as discussed in Section IV below are designed to ensure close stewardship of the hazardous waste aerosol cans.

5. Risks Posed by the Waste During Accumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to the Risks Posed by Other Hazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards Would Be Protective of Human Health and the Environment During Accumulation and Transport (40 CFR 273.81(e))

Aerosol cans are designed to contain the products they hold during the periods of storage and transportation as they move from the manufacturer, to the retailer, and ultimately to the final customer. As long as they remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol cans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained as-generated under normal management conditions. In addition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is addressed by standards set by the Department of Transportation, Office of Safety and Health Administration, and local fire codes.¹²

10 According to California’s guidance for their regulations, a “commercial processor” is any person that processes aerosol cans in exchange for compensation. Some examples include: Individuals from another generator’s site, registered hazardous waste transporters, operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage and/or disposal facilities, and operators of transportable treatment units.

# Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

These standards include requirements for outer packaging and can design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas and general pressure conditions.

Finally, as discussed below, the proposed management standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and drained at the handler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA believes that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the universal waste designation.

# 6. Regulation of the Waste Under 40 CFR Part 273 Will Increase the Likelihood That the Waste Will Be Diverted From Non-Hazardous Waste Management Systems (e.g., the Municipal Solid Waste Stream) to Recycling, Treatment, or Disposal in Compliance With Subtitle C of RCRA (40 CFR 273.81(f))

Managing hazardous waste aerosol cans under the universal waste program is expected to increase the number of these items collected, and to increase the number of aerosol cans being diverted from the non-hazardous waste stream into the hazardous waste stream because it would allow generators, especially those that generate this waste sporadically, to send it to a central consolidation point. Under the universal waste rule, a handler of universal waste can send the universal waste to another handler, where it can be consolidated into a larger shipment for transport to a destination facility. Therefore, under the proposed rule it would be more economical to send hazardous waste aerosol cans to recycling for recovery of metal values. EPA thus expects such management to not only advance the RCRA goal of increased resource conservation, but also to increase proper disposal as hazardous waste, making it less likely that it will be sent for improper disposal in municipal landfills or municipal incinerators. In addition, because of the streamlined structure of the universal waste rule makes aerosol can collection programs more economical, hazardous waste aerosol cans that might otherwise be sent to a municipal landfill under a VSQG or household hazardous waste exemption, would be more easily collected and consolidated for hazardous waste disposal by those who are interested in managing it this way. This waste would be diverted from the municipal solid waste stream to universal waste management.

# 7. Regulation of the Waste Under 40 CFR Part 273 Will Improve the Implementation and Compliance With the Hazardous Waste Regulatory Program (40 CFR 273.81(g))

In particular, state officials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol can universal waste programs have been in effect since 2002, and they have not identified any problems with compliance with the standards. Accordingly, this information also weighs in favor of concluding that management of aerosol cans under the federal universal waste regulations is likely to be successful.

# B. Expected Changes in Management of Aerosol Cans

If EPA’s proposal to include aerosol cans in the list of Universal Waste is finalized as proposed, EPA expects that the number of aerosol cans that are diverted from municipal solid waste landfills and incinerators to recycling or disposal in subtitle C facilities would increase. Small and large quantity generators are already required to manage their hazardous waste aerosol cans under RCRA subtitle C. As a result of implementation of this rule in the states, some of these generators would likely begin managing their aerosol cans as a universal waste, either to save money or to improve implementation of their existing waste management program. One of the streamlined provisions of the universal waste rule allows consolidation of aerosol cans at central locations, which makes it easier for smaller users to arrange for hazardous waste recycling or disposal of these materials when they are generated.

EPA intends to encourage individual households and VSQGs to participate in such programs, which would divert aerosol cans from the municipal waste stream.

in which gas under pressure is used to because it is not yet discarded) would also not be subject to this section.

# B. Proposed Management Requirements for Aerosol Cans

Consistent with prior universal waste rules, the proposed rule at 273.6(c) also explains that a used aerosol can becomes a waste on the date it is discarded, and an unused aerosol can becomes a waste on the date the handler decides to discard it.

A solid waste may be a hazardous waste either because it is listed as a hazardous waste in subpart D of 40 CFR part 261 or because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste, as provided in subpart C of 40 CFR part 261. For example, as discussed in Section II above, aerosol cans are frequently hazardous due to the ignitability characteristic, and in some cases may also contain listed hazardous waste or materials exhibiting another hazardous characteristic. If a solid waste aerosol can is determined to be non-hazardous then it is also not subject to the proposed universal waste regulations.

Utah’s definition of aerosol cans includes a size limitation of twenty-four ounces for aerosol cans that would qualify under their universal waste provisions. EPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that meet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system for the reasons explained in Section III above, and has not identified reasons why size would affect the considerations described.

However, EPA requests comment on whether to include a size limit of twenty-four ounces or other type of limitations on the types of aerosol cans that would be eligible for the federal universal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit would be necessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA requests comment on the appropriate scope of the definition of “aerosol can” and the types of materials that should fall under it.

# Proposed section 273.6 has specific exclusions from the coverage of the proposed rules in paragraph 273.6(b).

First, the proposed rules at 273.6(b)(1) and (2) exclude from the definition of “aerosol can” those cans that are not yet a waste under 40 CFR part 261, and those cans that are not hazardous waste, respectively. An aerosol can would only be subject to the proposed rule if it is considered a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261, and before a material can be determined to be a hazardous waste, it first must be determined to be a solid waste. Accordingly, any aerosol can that is not yet a solid waste (for example, a full aerosol can) would also not be subject to the proposed universal waste regulations.

# 2. Proposed Requirements and Request for Comment on Puncturing and Draining at Small and Large Quantity Handlers

As discussed in Section II above, under the current hazardous waste regulations, puncturing and draining an aerosol can, if performed as part of the recycling process (e.g., scrap metal recycling), is exempt from RCRA permitting requirements per 40 CFR 261.6(c). Storage of hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still requires a permit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provision.
---
# Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

However, EPA expects that order to prevent fires, use of personal protective equipment such as safety goggles, and segregating incompatible wastes; and proper waste management practices, (e.g., ensuring that flammable wastes are stored away from heat or open flames).

EPA is also proposing that the actual puncturing of the cans should be done in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of the aerosol can contents to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on a solid, flat surface in a well-ventilated area.

In addition, EPA is proposing that the contents from the cans should be immediately transferred from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank and that the contents are subject to a hazardous waste determination under 40 CFR 262.11. The handler becomes that hazardous waste generator of the hazardous aerosol can contents and must manage those waste in accordance with applicable RCRA regulations.

The proposed rule would also require that a written procedure be in place in the event of a spill or release and a spill clean-up kit should be provided. All spills or leaks of the contents of the aerosol cans should be cleaned up promptly.

Finally, EPA notes that all puncturing, waste collection, and disposal, must be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local waste (solid and hazardous waste) and occupational safety and health laws and regulations.

In addition, EPA is requesting comment on establishing further limitations on puncturing and draining of aerosol cans, similar to limitations that have been established by state waste management programs either through regulations or guidance. Many states have issued guidelines for puncturing and draining aerosol cans under their hazardous waste program.

These aerosol cans include, but are not limited to, cans containing the following contents: Ethers including ethyl ether, chlorinated compounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners and unknowns.

EPA requests comment on:

establishing additional regulatory requirements for universal waste management standards. Similarly, requirements for can draining devices and limits on aerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.

In addition, EPA is requesting comment on limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation). Such a limitation would be consistent with California’s universal waste program. Under this option, the puncturing and draining management standards would only apply to handlers that are not commercial processors. Handlers that are commercial processors may still accept aerosol cans and process the cans by sorting and consolidating them, but would be unable to puncture and drain the cans. Under this option, commercial processors that would like to puncture and drain aerosol cans must first meet the requirements for a universal waste destination facility (including requiring a permit for storage of the hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling).

Handlers would still be allowed to puncture and drain the hazardous waste aerosol cans that they generate.

# 1. Proposed Requirements for Transporters

This proposed rule would not change any of the existing requirements applicable to universal waste transporters. Under 40 CFR 273.9, the definition of a universal waste transporter is “a person engaged in the off-site transportation of universal waste by air, rail, highway, or water.” Persons meeting the definition of universal waste transporter include those persons who transport universal waste from one universal waste handler to another, to a processor, to a destination facility, or to a foreign destination. These persons are subject to the universal waste transporter requirements of part 273, subpart D. EPA notes that this proposed rule also would not affect the applicability of shipping requirements under the hazardous waste materials regulations of the Department of Transportation. Transporters continue to be subject to these requirements, if applicable (e.g., 49 CFR 173.306 for shipping of limited quantities of aerosol cans, or 49 CFR 173.115(l) which sets limits in the definition of “aerosol” for the purpose of shipping flammable gas).

# 2. Proposed Requirements for Destination Facilities

This proposed rule would not change any of the existing requirements applicable to universal waste destination facilities (subpart E of part 273). Under 40 CFR 273.9, the definition of a destination facility is “a facility that treats, disposes of, or recycles a particular category of universal waste” (except certain activities specified in the regulations at § 273.13(a) and (c) and § 273.33(a) and (c)).

# 3. Effect of This Proposed Rule on Household Wastes and Very Small Quantity Generators

This proposed rule would not change the applicability of land disposal restriction (LDR) requirements to universal waste. Under the existing regulations (40 CFR 268.1(f)), universal waste handlers and transporters are exempt from the land disposal restriction (LDR) requirements regarding testing, tracking, and recordkeeping in 40 CFR 268.7 and the storage prohibition in 40 CFR 268.50. EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 268.1(f) to add aerosol can universal waste for consistency. This proposed rule would also not change the regulatory status of destination facilities; they remain subject to the full LDR requirements.

# V. Technical Corrections

As part of this rulemaking, EPA is proposing four technical corrections to the universal waste standards for mercury-containing equipment in 40 CFR 273.13(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) and 273.33(c)(2)(iii) and (iv). Each of these paragraphs contains a reference to 40 CFR 262.34, which was removed and reserved as part of the November 28, 2016, Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule (81 FR 85732). EPA neglected to update these references as part of its corresponding changes in that rule and is correcting that mistake here. In all four places, EPA is proposing that the regulation refer to 40 CFR 262.16 or 262.17, as applicable.

# VI. State Authority

# A. Applicability of Proposed Rule in Authorized States

Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified states to administer and enforce the RCRA hazardous waste program within the state. Following authorization, EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized states have primary enforcement responsibility. The standards and requirements for state authorization are found at 40 CFR part 271. Prior to enactment of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), a State with final RCRA authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA administering the federal program in the state.

that state. The federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized state, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in that state, since only the state was authorized to issue RCRA permits. When EPA promulgated new, more stringent federal requirements for these pre-HSWA regulations, the state was obligated to enact equivalent authorities within specified time frames. However, the new federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized state, until the state adopted the federal requirements as state law. In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), which was added by HSWA, new requirements and prohibitions imposed under HSWA authority take effect in authorized states at the same time that they take effect in unauthorized states. EPA is directed by the statute to implement these requirements and prohibitions in authorized states, including the issuance of permits, until the state is granted authorization to do so. While states must still adopt HSWA related provisions as state law to retain final authorization, EPA implements the HSWA provisions in authorized states until the states do so.

Authorized states are required to modify their programs only when EPA enacts federal requirements that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing federal requirements. RCRA section 3009 allows the states to impose standards more stringent than those in the federal program (see also 40 CFR 271.1). Therefore, authorized states may, but are not required to, adopt federal regulations, both HSWA and non-HSWA, that are considered less stringent than previous federal regulations.

# B. Effect on State Authorization

This proposed rule would be less stringent than the current federal program. Because states are not required to adopt less stringent regulations, they would not have to adopt the universal waste regulations for aerosol cans, although EPA encourages them to do so. Some states have already added aerosol cans to the list of universal wastes in that state, and others may do so in the future. If a state’s standards for aerosol cans are less stringent than those in the final rule, the state would have to amend its regulations to make them at least equivalent to the federal standards and pursue authorization.

For both SQHUWs and LQHUWs, these requirements include labeling and marking, employee training, response to releases, and export requirements. LQHUWs are also subject to additional notification and tracking requirements.

# VII. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews

Additional information about these statutes and Executive Orders can be found at http://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/laws-and-executive-orders.

# Respondent’s obligation to respond:

The recordkeeping and notification requirements are required in order to obtain a benefit under 40 CFR part 273.

Estimated number of respondents: 639.

Frequency of response: One-time notification for LQHUWs, annual training requirements for all universal waste handlers; per-shipment costs for labeling (all handlers) and tracking (LQHUWs).

Total estimated burden: EPA estimates the annual burden to respondents to be a net reduction in burden of approximately 39,113 hours. Burden is defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b).

Total estimated cost: The total estimated annual cost of this rule is a cost savings of approximately $2.0 million. This cost savings is composed of approximately $1.94 million in annualized avoided labor costs and $0.06 million in avoided capital or operation and maintenance costs.

# C. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

The information collection activities in this proposed rule will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PRA. The Information Collection Request (ICR) documents that the EPA prepared have been assigned EPA ICR number 1597.12 and ICR number 2513.03. You can find copies of the ICRs in the docket for this rule, and they are briefly summarized here.

Because aerosol cans managed under the proposed rule are not counted toward a facility’s RCRA generator status, respondents will see a reduction in burden. This is because the aerosol cans would not be subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements as hazardous waste, and the respondent may no longer be subject to hazardous waste generator recordkeeping and reporting requirements, depending on the quantity of non-aerosol can hazardous waste they generate. The existing universal waste requirements currently applicable to small quantity handlers of universal waste (SQHUWs) and large quantity handlers of universal waste (LQHUWs) would also be applicable to handlers of aerosol can waste.

# D. Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

I certify that this proposed action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RFA. In making this determination, the impact of concern is any significant adverse economic impact on small entities. An agency may certify that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities if the rule relieves regulatory burden, has no net burden or otherwise has a positive economic effect on the small entities subject to the rule. As documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in the docket for this rule.
---
# Federal Register / Vol. 83, No. 52 / Friday, March 16, 2018 / Proposed Rules

Proposal, EPA does not expect the rule to result in an adverse impact to a significant number of small entities, since the rule is expected to result in net cost savings for all entities affected by the rule. We have therefore concluded that this proposed action will either relieve regulatory burden or have no net regulatory burden for all directly regulated small entities.

Dated: March 5, 2018.

E. Scott Pruitt, Administrator.

# E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA)

As documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in the docket for this proposal, this proposed action does not contain an unfunded mandate of $100 million or more as described in UMRA, 2 U.S.C. 1531–1538, and does not significantly or uniquely affect small governments.

# F. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

As documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis found in the docket for this proposal, this proposed action does not have federalism implications. It will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

# G. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments

This proposed action does not have tribal implications as specified in Executive Order 13175. Because the proposed rule is expected to result in net cost savings, EPA does not expect that it would result in any adverse impacts on tribal entities. Thus, Executive Order 13175 does not apply to this proposed action.

# H. Executive Order 13045: Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks

This proposed action is not subject to Executive Order 13045 because it is not economically significant as defined in Executive Order 12866, and because the EPA does not believe the environmental health or safety risks addressed by this proposed action present a disproportionate risk to children. This proposed action’s health and risk assessments are contained in the Regulatory Impact Analysis of Proposed Rule to Add Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Rule, found in the docket for this proposal.

# I. Executive Order 12898: Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations

The EPA believes that this proposed action does not have disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects on minority populations, low-income populations and/or indigenous peoples, as specified in Executive Order 12898 (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994). The documentation for this decision is contained in Regulatory Impact Analysis of Proposed Rule to Add Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Rule, found in the docket for this proposal.

# ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking; withdrawal.

# SUMMARY:

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is withdrawing its rulemaking concerning the proposed establishment of a large aircraft security program (LASP). TSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for LASP on October 30, 2008. In the NPRM, TSA proposed that certain private and corporate aircraft operations should adopt security standards similar to those of commercial aircraft operations, including the use of security programs, crew vetting, and passenger watchlist matching. The NPRM also proposed new requirements for airports that serve the private and corporate operations. TSA held a series of public meetings and reviewed more than 7,000 public comments submitted in response to the NPRM. Based on all of the information received and a re-evaluation of the proposal in light of risk-based principles, TSA has decided not to pursue this rulemaking at this time.

# DATES:

TSA is withdrawing the proposed rule published in Part III of the Federal Register on October 30, 2008 (73 FR 64789) as of March 16, 2018.
