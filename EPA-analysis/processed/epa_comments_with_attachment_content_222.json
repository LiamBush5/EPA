I believe the proposed hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emission standards for hydrogen chloride (HCl) as described in the amendment are a step in the right direction.\n\nUnder the Clean Air Act (CAA) \u00a7112, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to \u201cestablish emission standards that require the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants,\u201d also known as \u201cmaximum achievable control technology\u201d (MACT). This section also mandates the EPA reviews these standards every eight years and create revisions for any residual risks found. The EPA has done their due diligence and this amendment addresses the risks found for HCl. By implementing the changes in industry standards, the emissions of HCl would be reduced by 884 tons per year (tpy) which would have a substantial impact on air quality. As stated in the proposal, while there is not current evidence to determine if HCl is a carcinogen, it has been linked to health risks such as respiratory tract hyperplasia (increased cell production and tissue enlargement) of exposed rats which creates the potential for tumor or cancer development. If we can find and determine a threshold for HCl emissions, the improvement in air quality will lower the risks of adverse health effects in nearby communities. The number one purpose of the CAA is to \u201cprotect public health and public welfare and to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants.\u201d By setting a threshold and reducing HCl emissions, the EPA will be doing just that.\n\nUnder this amendment, the EPA is proposing the maximum compliance deadline allowed under CAA \u00a7112: three years. While the installations of equipment needed to ensure compliance of the existing lime manufacturers will take both time and money, allowing the entirety of three years from the effective date for manufacturers to come into compliance seems to be a bit excessive. I would like to propose a staggered approach giving manufacturers smaller goals and benchmarks throughout the three year compliance window. This would not only provide measurable data points the EPA could easily monitor and verify while ensuring progress of the manufacturers towards compliance, but it would also break down the daunting task of complying with the new standards into more approachable tasks which build upon themselves to reach the final emission reduction goals.",

Reg. 57,738 \n(July 16, 2024). As set forth in detail below, NLA requests that EPA reconsider its decision not \nto set a health-based emission limit (\u201cHBEL\u201d) under CAA section 112(d)(4) for hydrogen \nchloride (\u201cHCl\u201d).  \n \nAs promulgated, the Final Rule fails to consider important facts, data, and science, which \nprevented EPA from making a fully informed decision of whether it should issue an HBEL for \nHCl. The inclusion in the Final Rule of new and existing source emission limits instead results in \nunnecessary regulation. As described in more detail below, the objections raised in this petition \nwere impracticable to raise during the time period that EPA allowed for public comment on the \nproposed rule. EPA closed the public comment period one day after receiving comments on \nwhich EPA significantly relied to justify issuing source limits instead of an HBEL, which \nprecluded NLA from timely filing its own rebuttal comments, including a comprehensive and \nreputable report from a third-party environmental consulting firm explaining the appropriateness \nof issuing an HBEL for HCl. \n \nBecause NLA\u2019s objections go to the lawfulness of the final rule as promulgated, they are \nalso of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and thus satisfy the criteria and requirements \nof CAA section 307(d)(7)(B) regarding mandatory reconsideration. EPA should therefore \n\u201cconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule . . . .\u201d1 and ultimately establish an HBEL \nfor HCl. \n \nBACKGROUND \nOn July 16, 2024, EPA promulgated the Final Rule, revising maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for HCl, mercury, organic HAP, and dioxins/furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) in response to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. \nEPA (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) and a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club in \n \n1 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). \n \n \n3 Sierra Club v. EPA, et al. , Case No. 20-1381 (D.C. Circuit, September 22, 2020).2 NLA is \nconcurrently filing a petition for review of the Final Rule in the D.C. Circuit, and will, among \nother things, challenge EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN in that lawsuit. \n \nEPA\u2019s regulation of hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) produced during lime \nmanufacturing started two decades ago when, in 2004, EPA promulgated the National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants. (40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080-\n7083). In so doing, EPA noted that: \u201cthe purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health \nby reducing emissions of HAP from lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394-395 (Jan. 5, \n2004). EPA carefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector and regulated HAP emissions by \nestablishing a particulate matter (\u201cPM\u201d) standard as a surrogate for non-volatile and semi-\nvolatile metal HAPs. As part of this evaluation EPA \u201caddressed\u201d all four of the HAPs emitted by \nthe lime industry including HCl, mercury, organics, and dioxins and furans. Based on this \nevaluation, EPA found that new regulations were not necessary for those categories of HAPs. \nEPA additionally fulfilled its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (\u201cSBREFA\u201d) by reaching out to small lime \ncompanies, performing extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a \nsmall business panel with the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to identify less \nburdensome alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s regulatory objectives. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was not challenged by the lime industry or any environmental groups. \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA sections 112(d)(6) \nand (f)(2), or the \u201crisk and technology review\u201d (\u201cRTR\u201d). Here, EPA found that \u201crisks are \nacceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth\u201d and opted to not set standards for several pollutants, including HCl, mercury, organics, \nand D/F because doing so was not necessary. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. \n44960 (July 24, 2020). EPA further determined that \u201cthere are no developments in practices, \nprocesses, or control technologies that necessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id. \n \n Although EPA provided facts supporting an HBEL for HCl in the January 2023 Proposed \nRule that NLA supported in comments, EPA took a different approach in the February 2024 \nProposed Rule when it proposed to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl without providing \ndetails or an explanation of why EPA was reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant warranting an HBEL. Although EPA still solicited comment on the concept \nof adopting an HBEL for HCl in the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA ultimately rejected \npromulgating an HBEL in the Final Rule based upon comments submitted by environmental \ngroups at the close of the comment period. Immediately after close of the comment period, NLA \nsubmitted an analytical report rebutting the environmental group\u2019s comments. NLA requests that \nEPA reconsider the Final Rule in light of this report as described in more detail below. \n \n \n \n \n2 On October 22, 2020, EPA filed an unopposed motion to hold the case in abeyance while EPA considers \nPetitioner\u2019s petition for administrative reconsideration. The Court granted EPA\u2019s motion on October 29, 2020. \n \n \n4 ISSUES MERITING RECONSIDERATION \n \nI. NLA LACKED ANY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE \nFINAL RULE\u2019S ISSUANCE OF SOURCE LIMITS INSTEAD OF AN HBEL FOR \nHCL, EVEN THOUGH THAT DECISION HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON \nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL RULE \n \nA commenter\u2019s right to judicial review hinges on the ability to timely comment. Only an \nobjection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period \nfor public comment may be raised during judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). However, \nif the commenter raising an objection can demonstrate that it was impracticable to raise such \nobjection during the public comment period, or if the grounds for the objection arose after the \nperiod for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such \nobjection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, EPA must convene a proceeding for \nreconsideration of the rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded \nhad the information been available at the time the rule was proposed. Id. \n \nThree non-profit governmental organizations (the \u201cNGOs\u201d) filed lengthy comments on \nthe last day of the proposed rule comment period, asserting that an HBEL is improper for HCl \nand that HCl is a carcinogen.3 EPA did not post these comments to the docket until March 14, \n2024, two days after the public comment period closed.4 EPA ultimately sided with the NGOs,5 \nrejecting EPA\u2019s initial HBEL approach in favor of setting new and existing source limits for \nHCl. Due to the timing of the NGOs\u2019 filing, NLA and other commenters could not see the \nNGOs\u2019 comments before EPA\u2019s public comment period closed. However, as soon as NLA read \nthe NGOs\u2019 comments advocating for source limits instead of an HBEL, NLA engaged a \nrespected consultant to conduct a detailed analysis of the NGOs\u2019 comments.  The analysis  \nrebutted the NGOs\u2019 comments point-by-point in a 119-page report that NLA submitted almost \nimmediately after the public comment period closed.  See Ramboll Americas Engineering \nSolutions, Response to the comments of California Communities Against Toxics; Sierra Club; \nand Earthjustice regarding EPA\u2019s proposed health-based exposure limit for hydrochloric acid  \n(\u201cRamboll Report\u201d), dated April 23, 2024, submitted to EPA April 25, 2024, and attached as \nExhibit A. Because of the NGOs\u2019 timing in filing its comments, and EPA\u2019s delay posting the \ncomments, the objections raised in this petition were impracticable to raise during the time \nperiod that EPA allowed for public comment on the proposed rule. NLA was therefore denied \nthe opportunity to comment on or respond to the NGOs\u2019 comments, so NLA is doing so through \nthis Petition for Reconsideration.  \n \n \n \n3 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0015-0237 \n4 Id. \n5 In EPA\u2019s response to the NGOs and industry, EPA stated, \u201cThe EPA agrees with commenters\u2019 assertions that we \ncannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test to determine whether a pollutant has a threshold, for cancer or other \nadverse health effects. We acknowledge industry comments in support of an HBEL and that current HCl emissions \nbased upon the 2020 RTR are at levels that were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. However, considering \nthe other comments received, we have decided not to promulgate an HBEL for HCl.\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. at 57,742). \n \n \n5 II. EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL USING AN HBEL UNDER CAA SECTION \n112(d)(4) RATHER THAN USING SOURCE LIMITS \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA \nstated in the preamble to the rule that (1) HCl is a threshold pollutant; (2) even though HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA is soliciting comment on whether HCl is a threshold pollutant; (3) since \nHCl is a threshold pollutant, EPA proposed an HBEL; (4) since it is feasible that HCl is not a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA proposed source limits. National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9091-94 (Feb. 9, \n2024). Rather than issue an HBEL for HCl in the Final Rule, EPA did an about-face in the Final \nRule and promulgated source limits for HCl without much, if any, justification. In the absence of \nnew information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nfor the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. \n \nA. EPA Carefully and Correctly Evaluated the Scientific Data and Concluded \nthat HCl was a Threshold Pollutant in the Original Lime MACT Standard in \n2004 \n \nThe CAA allows EPA to use an HBEL when issuing emission standards under section \n112(d) for certain pollutants. (CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4)). Such an HBEL must \ninclude an \u201cample margin of safety.\u201d Id. In its 2004 112(d) MACT standard for lime \nmanufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl was a threshold pollutant, considering several factors \nsuch as \u201cevidence and classification of carcinogenic risk and evidence of non-carcinogenic \neffects.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing \nPlants , 67 Fed. Reg. 78046, 78054-55 (Dec. 20, 2002).6 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for \nhuman receptors. Id. at 78055. To aid in its analysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performed its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest potential \nfor risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed NLA\u2019s assessment. \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sources of HAP. EPA estimated the maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (\u201cHI\u201d) for \nthe lime manufacturing source category to be only 0.04 based on actual emission of HCl, nickel \n \n6 In the preamble to the proposed lime MACT standard in 2002, EPA noted that it had included a detailed discussion \nof factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold pollutant. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From \nChemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills , 63 Fed. \nReg. 18,766 (April 15, 1998). \n \n \n6 compounds, and acrolein emitted from lime kiln and cooler exhaust, and 0.05 based on allowable \nemissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, acrolein, and formaldehyde emissions as primary risk \ndrivers. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44,964.  In other words, when EPA did its follow-up residual risk \nassessment using representative data under actual and allowable emissions scenarios, it found \nthat the chronic risks from all noncancer HAPs (including, but not limited to, HCl) were much \nlower than the risks estimated in 2002. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining \nthat risks from uncontrolled emissions of HCl were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d 67  Fed. Reg  at \n78057. Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id. EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \nwere below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since passed. (CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in the Final Rule.7 \n \nIn its 2020 RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor to \nconduct a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard \n(which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone an HBEL) were \u201cacceptable\u201d and that the \n\u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d (85 Fed. Reg. \n44,960). EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \n\u201cmaximum individual cancer risk for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 \nmillion,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing source \ncategory were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Final Amendments to Air Toxics Standards \nfor Lime Manufacturing Plants, June, 2020.8  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded in other rules that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November \n18, 2021, EPA issued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations \nindustry. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Fabrication Operations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Production and Fabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. \n18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA \nspecifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d Id. at 64391-92. \nFurther, several other RTRs have confirmed EPA\u2019s longstanding position that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing \nand Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, \n14535 (Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion \nthat HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology \n \n7 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to an HBEL under \n112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified.  \n8 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf \n \n \n7 Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk \nassessment\u2026indicate there is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is \nnot classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d).\u2019 \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, as noted \nabove, newer information, including the Ramboll Report, only serve to strengthen the \ndetermination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA should not have reversed its prior \ndecision and should have promulgated an HBEL for HCl. \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Final Rule Improperly Concludes that HCl Should be Regulated \nUsing Source Limits Rather than an HBEL. \n \nIn the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA sought comments on potentially setting an \nHBEL for HCl. EPA made several key statements that supported such a standard, including \nrecognizing that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for an HBEL to be set. \nEPA stated in the preamble: \n \nWith regard to carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that \nthe science and methods of cancer risk assessment have evolved \nover the 33 years since the CAA amendments were issued. The \nEPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold \nor threshold pollutants. Linear non-threshold carcinogens can \ncause adverse health effects, including cancer, at any level of \nexposure. In contrast, non-linear threshold carcinogens may pose a \ncancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA \nsection 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus on a threshold, not cancer risk, we \nbelieve that the issue is not whether HCl is a carcinogen but rather \nwhether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (footnotes omitted). \n \nEPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092-93.  \n \nBased on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health-based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows: \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of \n300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would \nexpect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions from this source \ncategory, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain \nat levels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a \nmaximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on \n \n \n8 whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety \nand whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9094. \n \nNLA strongly believes that such a standard provides an ample margin of safety. EPA has \nalready performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and \nfound, on multiple occasions, that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin of \nsafety with no additional standards at all. Thus, an HBEL will by definition also provide an \nample margin of safety\u2014essentially, one already exists. An HBEL would guarantee that HCl \nemissions would remain below any possible level of concern. Accordingly, NLA  urges EPA to \nconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the Final Rule and set an HBEL for HCl, based on \nEPA\u2019s own findings. \n \nIII. RECONSIDERATION OF THE MERCURY, ORGANICS, AND D/F \nSTANDARDS \n \nNLA further requests that EPA reconsider the final rule in its entirety. A decision to replace \nthe final HCl standards with an HBEL would have a substantial impact on other elements of the \nrule and EPA\u2019s analysis, including costs, avoided risk and feasibility of controls. Furthermore, \nNLA believes that EPA should have adopted NLA\u2019s suggestions on multiple elements of the \nrule, including the proper intra-quarry variability factor for mercury, the correct calculation of an \norganic HAPs standard, an alternative compliance method for dioxins and furans, and others.

Reg. 57,738 \n(July 16, 2024). As set forth in detail below, NLA requests that EPA reconsider its decision not \nto set a health-based emission limit (\u201cHBEL\u201d) under CAA section 112(d)(4) for hydrogen \nchloride (\u201cHCl\u201d).  \n \nAs promulgated, the Final Rule fails to consider important facts, data, and science, which \nprevented EPA from making a fully informed decision of whether it should issue an HBEL for \nHCl. The inclusion in the Final Rule of new and existing source emission limits instead results in \nunnecessary regulation. As described in more detail below, the objections raised in this petition \nwere impracticable to raise during the time period that EPA allowed for public comment on the \nproposed rule. EPA closed the public comment period one day after receiving comments on \nwhich EPA significantly relied to justify issuing source limits instead of an HBEL, which \nprecluded NLA from timely filing its own rebuttal comments, including a comprehensive and \nreputable report from a third-party environmental consulting firm explaining the appropriateness \nof issuing an HBEL for HCl. \n \nBecause NLA\u2019s objections go to the lawfulness of the final rule as promulgated, they are \nalso of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and thus satisfy the criteria and requirements \nof CAA section 307(d)(7)(B) regarding mandatory reconsideration. EPA should therefore \n\u201cconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule . . . .\u201d1 and ultimately establish an HBEL \nfor HCl. \n \nBACKGROUND \nOn July 16, 2024, EPA promulgated the Final Rule, revising maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for HCl, mercury, organic HAP, and dioxins/furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) in response to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. \nEPA (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) and a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club in \n \n1 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). \n \n \n3 Sierra Club v. EPA, et al. , Case No. 20-1381 (D.C. Circuit, September 22, 2020).2 NLA is \nconcurrently filing a petition for review of the Final Rule in the D.C. Circuit, and will, among \nother things, challenge EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN in that lawsuit. \n \nEPA\u2019s regulation of hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) produced during lime \nmanufacturing started two decades ago when, in 2004, EPA promulgated the National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants. (40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080-\n7083). In so doing, EPA noted that: \u201cthe purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health \nby reducing emissions of HAP from lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394-395 (Jan. 5, \n2004). EPA carefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector and regulated HAP emissions by \nestablishing a particulate matter (\u201cPM\u201d) standard as a surrogate for non-volatile and semi-\nvolatile metal HAPs. As part of this evaluation EPA \u201caddressed\u201d all four of the HAPs emitted by \nthe lime industry including HCl, mercury, organics, and dioxins and furans. Based on this \nevaluation, EPA found that new regulations were not necessary for those categories of HAPs. \nEPA additionally fulfilled its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (\u201cSBREFA\u201d) by reaching out to small lime \ncompanies, performing extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a \nsmall business panel with the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to identify less \nburdensome alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s regulatory objectives. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was not challenged by the lime industry or any environmental groups. \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA sections 112(d)(6) \nand (f)(2), or the \u201crisk and technology review\u201d (\u201cRTR\u201d). Here, EPA found that \u201crisks are \nacceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth\u201d and opted to not set standards for several pollutants, including HCl, mercury, organics, \nand D/F because doing so was not necessary. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. \n44960 (July 24, 2020). EPA further determined that \u201cthere are no developments in practices, \nprocesses, or control technologies that necessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id. \n \n Although EPA provided facts supporting an HBEL for HCl in the January 2023 Proposed \nRule that NLA supported in comments, EPA took a different approach in the February 2024 \nProposed Rule when it proposed to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl without providing \ndetails or an explanation of why EPA was reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant warranting an HBEL. Although EPA still solicited comment on the concept \nof adopting an HBEL for HCl in the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA ultimately rejected \npromulgating an HBEL in the Final Rule based upon comments submitted by environmental \ngroups at the close of the comment period. Immediately after close of the comment period, NLA \nsubmitted an analytical report rebutting the environmental group\u2019s comments. NLA requests that \nEPA reconsider the Final Rule in light of this report as described in more detail below. \n \n \n \n \n2 On October 22, 2020, EPA filed an unopposed motion to hold the case in abeyance while EPA considers \nPetitioner\u2019s petition for administrative reconsideration. The Court granted EPA\u2019s motion on October 29, 2020. \n \n \n4 ISSUES MERITING RECONSIDERATION \n \nI. NLA LACKED ANY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE \nFINAL RULE\u2019S ISSUANCE OF SOURCE LIMITS INSTEAD OF AN HBEL FOR \nHCL, EVEN THOUGH THAT DECISION HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON \nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL RULE \n \nA commenter\u2019s right to judicial review hinges on the ability to timely comment. Only an \nobjection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period \nfor public comment may be raised during judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). However, \nif the commenter raising an objection can demonstrate that it was impracticable to raise such \nobjection during the public comment period, or if the grounds for the objection arose after the \nperiod for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such \nobjection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, EPA must convene a proceeding for \nreconsideration of the rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded \nhad the information been available at the time the rule was proposed. Id. \n \nThree non-profit governmental organizations (the \u201cNGOs\u201d) filed lengthy comments on \nthe last day of the proposed rule comment period, asserting that an HBEL is improper for HCl \nand that HCl is a carcinogen.3 EPA did not post these comments to the docket until March 14, \n2024, two days after the public comment period closed.4 EPA ultimately sided with the NGOs,5 \nrejecting EPA\u2019s initial HBEL approach in favor of setting new and existing source limits for \nHCl. Due to the timing of the NGOs\u2019 filing, NLA and other commenters could not see the \nNGOs\u2019 comments before EPA\u2019s public comment period closed. However, as soon as NLA read \nthe NGOs\u2019 comments advocating for source limits instead of an HBEL, NLA engaged a \nrespected consultant to conduct a detailed analysis of the NGOs\u2019 comments.  The analysis  \nrebutted the NGOs\u2019 comments point-by-point in a 119-page report that NLA submitted almost \nimmediately after the public comment period closed.  See Ramboll Americas Engineering \nSolutions, Response to the comments of California Communities Against Toxics; Sierra Club; \nand Earthjustice regarding EPA\u2019s proposed health-based exposure limit for hydrochloric acid  \n(\u201cRamboll Report\u201d), dated April 23, 2024, submitted to EPA April 25, 2024, and attached as \nExhibit A. Because of the NGOs\u2019 timing in filing its comments, and EPA\u2019s delay posting the \ncomments, the objections raised in this petition were impracticable to raise during the time \nperiod that EPA allowed for public comment on the proposed rule. NLA was therefore denied \nthe opportunity to comment on or respond to the NGOs\u2019 comments, so NLA is doing so through \nthis Petition for Reconsideration.  \n \n \n \n3 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0015-0237 \n4 Id. \n5 In EPA\u2019s response to the NGOs and industry, EPA stated, \u201cThe EPA agrees with commenters\u2019 assertions that we \ncannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test to determine whether a pollutant has a threshold, for cancer or other \nadverse health effects. We acknowledge industry comments in support of an HBEL and that current HCl emissions \nbased upon the 2020 RTR are at levels that were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. However, considering \nthe other comments received, we have decided not to promulgate an HBEL for HCl.\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. at 57,742). \n \n \n5 II. EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL USING AN HBEL UNDER CAA SECTION \n112(d)(4) RATHER THAN USING SOURCE LIMITS \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA \nstated in the preamble to the rule that (1) HCl is a threshold pollutant; (2) even though HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA is soliciting comment on whether HCl is a threshold pollutant; (3) since \nHCl is a threshold pollutant, EPA proposed an HBEL; (4) since it is feasible that HCl is not a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA proposed source limits. National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9091-94 (Feb. 9, \n2024). Rather than issue an HBEL for HCl in the Final Rule, EPA did an about-face in the Final \nRule and promulgated source limits for HCl without much, if any, justification. In the absence of \nnew information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nfor the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. \n \nA. EPA Carefully and Correctly Evaluated the Scientific Data and Concluded \nthat HCl was a Threshold Pollutant in the Original Lime MACT Standard in \n2004 \n \nThe CAA allows EPA to use an HBEL when issuing emission standards under section \n112(d) for certain pollutants. (CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4)). Such an HBEL must \ninclude an \u201cample margin of safety.\u201d Id. In its 2004 112(d) MACT standard for lime \nmanufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl was a threshold pollutant, considering several factors \nsuch as \u201cevidence and classification of carcinogenic risk and evidence of non-carcinogenic \neffects.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing \nPlants , 67 Fed. Reg. 78046, 78054-55 (Dec. 20, 2002).6 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for \nhuman receptors. Id. at 78055. To aid in its analysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performed its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest potential \nfor risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed NLA\u2019s assessment. \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sources of HAP. EPA estimated the maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (\u201cHI\u201d) for \nthe lime manufacturing source category to be only 0.04 based on actual emission of HCl, nickel \n \n6 In the preamble to the proposed lime MACT standard in 2002, EPA noted that it had included a detailed discussion \nof factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold pollutant. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From \nChemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills , 63 Fed. \nReg. 18,766 (April 15, 1998). \n \n \n6 compounds, and acrolein emitted from lime kiln and cooler exhaust, and 0.05 based on allowable \nemissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, acrolein, and formaldehyde emissions as primary risk \ndrivers. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44,964.  In other words, when EPA did its follow-up residual risk \nassessment using representative data under actual and allowable emissions scenarios, it found \nthat the chronic risks from all noncancer HAPs (including, but not limited to, HCl) were much \nlower than the risks estimated in 2002. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining \nthat risks from uncontrolled emissions of HCl were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d 67  Fed. Reg  at \n78057. Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id. EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \nwere below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since passed. (CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in the Final Rule.7 \n \nIn its 2020 RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor to \nconduct a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard \n(which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone an HBEL) were \u201cacceptable\u201d and that the \n\u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d (85 Fed. Reg. \n44,960). EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \n\u201cmaximum individual cancer risk for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 \nmillion,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing source \ncategory were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Final Amendments to Air Toxics Standards \nfor Lime Manufacturing Plants, June, 2020.8  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded in other rules that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November \n18, 2021, EPA issued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations \nindustry. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Fabrication Operations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Production and Fabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. \n18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA \nspecifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d Id. at 64391-92. \nFurther, several other RTRs have confirmed EPA\u2019s longstanding position that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing \nand Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, \n14535 (Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion \nthat HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology \n \n7 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to an HBEL under \n112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified.  \n8 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf \n \n \n7 Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk \nassessment\u2026indicate there is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is \nnot classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d).\u2019 \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, as noted \nabove, newer information, including the Ramboll Report, only serve to strengthen the \ndetermination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA should not have reversed its prior \ndecision and should have promulgated an HBEL for HCl. \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Final Rule Improperly Concludes that HCl Should be Regulated \nUsing Source Limits Rather than an HBEL. \n \nIn the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA sought comments on potentially setting an \nHBEL for HCl. EPA made several key statements that supported such a standard, including \nrecognizing that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for an HBEL to be set. \nEPA stated in the preamble: \n \nWith regard to carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that \nthe science and methods of cancer risk assessment have evolved \nover the 33 years since the CAA amendments were issued. The \nEPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold \nor threshold pollutants. Linear non-threshold carcinogens can \ncause adverse health effects, including cancer, at any level of \nexposure. In contrast, non-linear threshold carcinogens may pose a \ncancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA \nsection 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus on a threshold, not cancer risk, we \nbelieve that the issue is not whether HCl is a carcinogen but rather \nwhether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (footnotes omitted). \n \nEPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092-93.  \n \nBased on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health-based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows: \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of \n300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would \nexpect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions from this source \ncategory, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain \nat levels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a \nmaximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on \n \n \n8 whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety \nand whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9094. \n \nNLA strongly believes that such a standard provides an ample margin of safety. EPA has \nalready performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and \nfound, on multiple occasions, that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin of \nsafety with no additional standards at all. Thus, an HBEL will by definition also provide an \nample margin of safety\u2014essentially, one already exists. An HBEL would guarantee that HCl \nemissions would remain below any possible level of concern. Accordingly, NLA  urges EPA to \nconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the Final Rule and set an HBEL for HCl, based on \nEPA\u2019s own findings. \n \nIII. RECONSIDERATION OF THE MERCURY, ORGANICS, AND D/F \nSTANDARDS \n \nNLA further requests that EPA reconsider the final rule in its entirety. A decision to replace \nthe final HCl standards with an HBEL would have a substantial impact on other elements of the \nrule and EPA\u2019s analysis, including costs, avoided risk and feasibility of controls. Furthermore, \nNLA believes that EPA should have adopted NLA\u2019s suggestions on multiple elements of the \nrule, including the proper intra-quarry variability factor for mercury, the correct calculation of an \norganic HAPs standard, an alternative compliance method for dioxins and furans, and others. In \naddition, NLA believes that EPA should reconsider whether it should decline to regulate \nadditional HAPs under de minimis  principles, bearing in mind that courts will no longer give \ndeference to an agency\u2019s statutory construction that is not the \u201cbest\u201d interpretation of the statute \nin the court\u2019s judgment See Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo  144 S.Ct. 2244, 2247 (2024); \nWisc. Dep\u2019t of Rev. v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co. 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992).  \n \n \n"

Reg. 57,738 \n(July 16, 2024). As set forth in detail below, NLA requests that EPA reconsider its decision not \nto set a health-based emission limit (\u201cHBEL\u201d) under CAA section 112(d)(4) for hydrogen \nchloride (\u201cHCl\u201d).  \n \nAs promulgated, the Final Rule fails to consider important facts, data, and science, which \nprevented EPA from making a fully informed decision of whether it should issue an HBEL for \nHCl. The inclusion in the Final Rule of new and existing source emission limits instead results in \nunnecessary regulation. As described in more detail below, the objections raised in this petition \nwere impracticable to raise during the time period that EPA allowed for public comment on the \nproposed rule. EPA closed the public comment period one day after receiving comments on \nwhich EPA significantly relied to justify issuing source limits instead of an HBEL, which \nprecluded NLA from timely filing its own rebuttal comments, including a comprehensive and \nreputable report from a third-party environmental consulting firm explaining the appropriateness \nof issuing an HBEL for HCl. \n \nBecause NLA\u2019s objections go to the lawfulness of the final rule as promulgated, they are \nalso of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and thus satisfy the criteria and requirements \nof CAA section 307(d)(7)(B) regarding mandatory reconsideration. EPA should therefore \n\u201cconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the rule . . . .\u201d1 and ultimately establish an HBEL \nfor HCl. \n \nBACKGROUND \nOn July 16, 2024, EPA promulgated the Final Rule, revising maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for HCl, mercury, organic HAP, and dioxins/furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) in response to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. \nEPA (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) and a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club in \n \n1 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). \n \n \n3 Sierra Club v. EPA, et al. , Case No. 20-1381 (D.C. Circuit, September 22, 2020).2 NLA is \nconcurrently filing a petition for review of the Final Rule in the D.C. Circuit, and will, among \nother things, challenge EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN in that lawsuit. \n \nEPA\u2019s regulation of hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) produced during lime \nmanufacturing started two decades ago when, in 2004, EPA promulgated the National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants. (40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080-\n7083). In so doing, EPA noted that: \u201cthe purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health \nby reducing emissions of HAP from lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394-395 (Jan. 5, \n2004). EPA carefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector and regulated HAP emissions by \nestablishing a particulate matter (\u201cPM\u201d) standard as a surrogate for non-volatile and semi-\nvolatile metal HAPs. As part of this evaluation EPA \u201caddressed\u201d all four of the HAPs emitted by \nthe lime industry including HCl, mercury, organics, and dioxins and furans. Based on this \nevaluation, EPA found that new regulations were not necessary for those categories of HAPs. \nEPA additionally fulfilled its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (\u201cSBREFA\u201d) by reaching out to small lime \ncompanies, performing extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a \nsmall business panel with the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) to identify less \nburdensome alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s regulatory objectives. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was not challenged by the lime industry or any environmental groups. \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA sections 112(d)(6) \nand (f)(2), or the \u201crisk and technology review\u201d (\u201cRTR\u201d). Here, EPA found that \u201crisks are \nacceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth\u201d and opted to not set standards for several pollutants, including HCl, mercury, organics, \nand D/F because doing so was not necessary. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. \n44960 (July 24, 2020). EPA further determined that \u201cthere are no developments in practices, \nprocesses, or control technologies that necessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id. \n \n Although EPA provided facts supporting an HBEL for HCl in the January 2023 Proposed \nRule that NLA supported in comments, EPA took a different approach in the February 2024 \nProposed Rule when it proposed to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl without providing \ndetails or an explanation of why EPA was reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant warranting an HBEL. Although EPA still solicited comment on the concept \nof adopting an HBEL for HCl in the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA ultimately rejected \npromulgating an HBEL in the Final Rule based upon comments submitted by environmental \ngroups at the close of the comment period. Immediately after close of the comment period, NLA \nsubmitted an analytical report rebutting the environmental group\u2019s comments. NLA requests that \nEPA reconsider the Final Rule in light of this report as described in more detail below. \n \n \n \n \n2 On October 22, 2020, EPA filed an unopposed motion to hold the case in abeyance while EPA considers \nPetitioner\u2019s petition for administrative reconsideration. The Court granted EPA\u2019s motion on October 29, 2020. \n \n \n4 ISSUES MERITING RECONSIDERATION \n \nI. NLA LACKED ANY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE \nFINAL RULE\u2019S ISSUANCE OF SOURCE LIMITS INSTEAD OF AN HBEL FOR \nHCL, EVEN THOUGH THAT DECISION HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON \nIMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL RULE \n \nA commenter\u2019s right to judicial review hinges on the ability to timely comment. Only an \nobjection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period \nfor public comment may be raised during judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). However, \nif the commenter raising an objection can demonstrate that it was impracticable to raise such \nobjection during the public comment period, or if the grounds for the objection arose after the \nperiod for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such \nobjection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, EPA must convene a proceeding for \nreconsideration of the rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded \nhad the information been available at the time the rule was proposed. Id. \n \nThree non-profit governmental organizations (the \u201cNGOs\u201d) filed lengthy comments on \nthe last day of the proposed rule comment period, asserting that an HBEL is improper for HCl \nand that HCl is a carcinogen.3 EPA did not post these comments to the docket until March 14, \n2024, two days after the public comment period closed.4 EPA ultimately sided with the NGOs,5 \nrejecting EPA\u2019s initial HBEL approach in favor of setting new and existing source limits for \nHCl. Due to the timing of the NGOs\u2019 filing, NLA and other commenters could not see the \nNGOs\u2019 comments before EPA\u2019s public comment period closed. However, as soon as NLA read \nthe NGOs\u2019 comments advocating for source limits instead of an HBEL, NLA engaged a \nrespected consultant to conduct a detailed analysis of the NGOs\u2019 comments.  The analysis  \nrebutted the NGOs\u2019 comments point-by-point in a 119-page report that NLA submitted almost \nimmediately after the public comment period closed.  See Ramboll Americas Engineering \nSolutions, Response to the comments of California Communities Against Toxics; Sierra Club; \nand Earthjustice regarding EPA\u2019s proposed health-based exposure limit for hydrochloric acid  \n(\u201cRamboll Report\u201d), dated April 23, 2024, submitted to EPA April 25, 2024, and attached as \nExhibit A. Because of the NGOs\u2019 timing in filing its comments, and EPA\u2019s delay posting the \ncomments, the objections raised in this petition were impracticable to raise during the time \nperiod that EPA allowed for public comment on the proposed rule. NLA was therefore denied \nthe opportunity to comment on or respond to the NGOs\u2019 comments, so NLA is doing so through \nthis Petition for Reconsideration.  \n \n \n \n3 https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0015-0237 \n4 Id. \n5 In EPA\u2019s response to the NGOs and industry, EPA stated, \u201cThe EPA agrees with commenters\u2019 assertions that we \ncannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test to determine whether a pollutant has a threshold, for cancer or other \nadverse health effects. We acknowledge industry comments in support of an HBEL and that current HCl emissions \nbased upon the 2020 RTR are at levels that were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. However, considering \nthe other comments received, we have decided not to promulgate an HBEL for HCl.\u201d (89 Fed. Reg. at 57,742). \n \n \n5 II. EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL USING AN HBEL UNDER CAA SECTION \n112(d)(4) RATHER THAN USING SOURCE LIMITS \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA \nstated in the preamble to the rule that (1) HCl is a threshold pollutant; (2) even though HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA is soliciting comment on whether HCl is a threshold pollutant; (3) since \nHCl is a threshold pollutant, EPA proposed an HBEL; (4) since it is feasible that HCl is not a \nthreshold pollutant, EPA proposed source limits. National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9091-94 (Feb. 9, \n2024). Rather than issue an HBEL for HCl in the Final Rule, EPA did an about-face in the Final \nRule and promulgated source limits for HCl without much, if any, justification. In the absence of \nnew information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nfor the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. \n \nA. EPA Carefully and Correctly Evaluated the Scientific Data and Concluded \nthat HCl was a Threshold Pollutant in the Original Lime MACT Standard in \n2004 \n \nThe CAA allows EPA to use an HBEL when issuing emission standards under section \n112(d) for certain pollutants. (CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4)). Such an HBEL must \ninclude an \u201cample margin of safety.\u201d Id. In its 2004 112(d) MACT standard for lime \nmanufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl was a threshold pollutant, considering several factors \nsuch as \u201cevidence and classification of carcinogenic risk and evidence of non-carcinogenic \neffects.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing \nPlants , 67 Fed. Reg. 78046, 78054-55 (Dec. 20, 2002).6 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for \nhuman receptors. Id. at 78055. To aid in its analysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performed its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest potential \nfor risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed NLA\u2019s assessment. \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sources of HAP. EPA estimated the maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (\u201cHI\u201d) for \nthe lime manufacturing source category to be only 0.04 based on actual emission of HCl, nickel \n \n6 In the preamble to the proposed lime MACT standard in 2002, EPA noted that it had included a detailed discussion \nof factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold pollutant. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From \nChemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills , 63 Fed. \nReg. 18,766 (April 15, 1998). \n \n \n6 compounds, and acrolein emitted from lime kiln and cooler exhaust, and 0.05 based on allowable \nemissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, acrolein, and formaldehyde emissions as primary risk \ndrivers. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44,964.  In other words, when EPA did its follow-up residual risk \nassessment using representative data under actual and allowable emissions scenarios, it found \nthat the chronic risks from all noncancer HAPs (including, but not limited to, HCl) were much \nlower than the risks estimated in 2002. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining \nthat risks from uncontrolled emissions of HCl were acceptable with an ample margin of safety. \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d 67  Fed. Reg  at \n78057. Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id. EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \nwere below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since passed. (CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in the Final Rule.7 \n \nIn its 2020 RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor to \nconduct a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard \n(which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone an HBEL) were \u201cacceptable\u201d and that the \n\u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d (85 Fed. Reg. \n44,960). EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \n\u201cmaximum individual cancer risk for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 \nmillion,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing source \ncategory were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Final Amendments to Air Toxics Standards \nfor Lime Manufacturing Plants, June, 2020.8  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded in other rules that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November \n18, 2021, EPA issued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations \nindustry. National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Fabrication Operations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane \nFoam Production and Fabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. \n18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA \nspecifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d Id. at 64391-92. \nFurther, several other RTRs have confirmed EPA\u2019s longstanding position that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing \nand Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, \n14535 (Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion \nthat HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology \n \n7 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to an HBEL under \n112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified.  \n8 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf \n \n \n7 Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk \nassessment\u2026indicate there is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is \nnot classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d).\u2019 \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, EPA\u2019s reversal of its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry is arbitrary and capricious. Moreover, as noted \nabove, newer information, including the Ramboll Report, only serve to strengthen the \ndetermination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA should not have reversed its prior \ndecision and should have promulgated an HBEL for HCl. \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Final Rule Improperly Concludes that HCl Should be Regulated \nUsing Source Limits Rather than an HBEL. \n \nIn the February 2024 Proposed Rule, EPA sought comments on potentially setting an \nHBEL for HCl. EPA made several key statements that supported such a standard, including \nrecognizing that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for an HBEL to be set. \nEPA stated in the preamble: \n \nWith regard to carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that \nthe science and methods of cancer risk assessment have evolved \nover the 33 years since the CAA amendments were issued. The \nEPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold \nor threshold pollutants. Linear non-threshold carcinogens can \ncause adverse health effects, including cancer, at any level of \nexposure. In contrast, non-linear threshold carcinogens may pose a \ncancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA \nsection 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus on a threshold, not cancer risk, we \nbelieve that the issue is not whether HCl is a carcinogen but rather \nwhether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (footnotes omitted). \n \nEPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092-93.  \n \nBased on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health-based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows: \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of \n300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would \nexpect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions from this source \ncategory, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain \nat levels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a \nmaximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on \n \n \n8 whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety \nand whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. at 9094. \n \nNLA strongly believes that such a standard provides an ample margin of safety. EPA has \nalready performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and \nfound, on multiple occasions, that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin of \nsafety with no additional standards at all. Thus, an HBEL will by definition also provide an \nample margin of safety\u2014essentially, one already exists. An HBEL would guarantee that HCl \nemissions would remain below any possible level of concern. Accordingly, NLA  urges EPA to \nconvene a proceeding for reconsideration of the Final Rule and set an HBEL for HCl, based on \nEPA\u2019s own findings. \n \nIII. RECONSIDERATION OF THE MERCURY, ORGANICS, AND D/F \nSTANDARDS \n \nNLA further requests that EPA reconsider the final rule in its entirety. A decision to replace \nthe final HCl standards with an HBEL would have a substantial impact on other elements of the \nrule and EPA\u2019s analysis, including costs, avoided risk and feasibility of controls. Furthermore, \nNLA believes that EPA should have adopted NLA\u2019s suggestions on multiple elements of the \nrule, including the proper intra-quarry variability factor for mercury, the correct calculation of an \norganic HAPs standard, an alternative compliance method for dioxins and furans, and others. In \naddition, NLA believes that EPA should reconsider whether it should decline to regulate \nadditional HAPs under de minimis  principles, bearing in mind that courts will no longer give \ndeference to an agency\u2019s statutory construction that is not the \u201cbest\u201d interpretation of the statute \nin the court\u2019s judgment See Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo  144 S.Ct. 2244, 2247 (2024); \nWisc. Dep\u2019t of Rev. v. William Wrigley, Jr., Co. 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992).  \n \n \n"

The limitations on air pollution are crucial to the well-being and safety of us citizens. Any action to increase the quality of the air we breathe should be commenced swiftly and regularly. As such, semi-annual reporting of compliance reports is essential, and companies should strictly adhere to this new standard. It is prudent to allow companies a 3-year period to ease into compliance. 3 years is sufficient time to comply to these new standards and any and all complaints regarding this change should show empathy to the changing environmental politics that are occurring worldwide. As a citizen, this proposal must be passed and adhered to for the protection of our people and environment.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read the considerations of concerned citizens.",

As I mentioned earlier, we must recognize EPA's efforts to address pollutant emissions standards and to provide an opportunity for the public to comment on these important regulations.\n\nI believe the proposed amendments, which include standards for contaminants such as hydrogen chloride, mercury, total hydrocarbons as a substitute for organic PAHs, and dioxins/furans, are critical to protecting public health and the environment. It is encouraging to see that EPA is reviewing and updating these standards based on new information gathered since the publication of the initial proposal.\n\nIn summary, I support the proposed amendments to the Hazardous Air Pollutant Emission Standards for Lime Manufacturing Plants and encourage EPA to continue its work to protect and improve air quality and public health.",

AISI serves as th e voice of the American steel industry in the \npublic policy arena and advances the case for steel in the marketplace as the preferred \nmaterial of choice.  AISI also plays a leading role in the development and application of \nnew steels and steelmaking techn ology.  AISI is comprised of member companies, \nincluding electric arc furnace steelmakers and integrated steelmakers, and associate \nmembers who are suppliers to, or customers of, the steel industry.   \nAISI is  writ ing to add our  support  for the stan ce taken by EPA  in the  propos al to set \nhealth- based emission limits ( HBELs ) for hydrogen chloride ( HCl) emissions.   AISI  \nstrongly supports  EPA\u2019s proposal to adopt such standards.   AISI further believe s that \nHBELs can and should be much more widely used to minimize unwarranted over -\nregulation and that EPA should adopt additional HBELs for many other source \ncategories as part of the periodic technical reviews required by CAA Sec.  112(d)(6).  In \nparticular, AISI fully supports t he National Lime Association ( NLA ) comments  on the \nproposal.  NLA provides  an extensive discussion and analysis in support of EPA\u2019s legal, \ntechnical  and scientific assertions regarding this matter .  Further, AISI is a member of \nthe Air Advocacy Coalition ( A2C ) and  supports t he A2C comments o n this EPA \nproposal.  25 Massachusetts Avenue, NW  \nSuite 800 \nWashington, DC  20001  \nPhone 202.452. 7100 \nFax 202.452.1039 \nE-mail:  PBalserak @steel.org  \n \nwww.steel.org  \n \n \n\nAISI Comment s on Lime  Supplemental  NPRM  \nMarch  11, 2024  \nPage 2 of 2 \n \nThe Clean Air Act (C AA)  Sec. 112(d)(4)  provide s EPA  with  authority to set a less \nstringent emission limitation for a threshold hazardous air pollutant ( HAP ) than would \notherwise be required using the typical maximum achieva ble control techn ology \n(MACT ) process for  setting standard s.  In this case, t he alternative standard must \nprovide  an ample margin of safety against potential health impacts .   \nAdditionally,  AISI agrees with  EPA\u2019s technical and scientific assertions that  the \navailable evidence supports the conclusion that there is a protective health threshold \nbelow which there should be no appreciable risk of developing cancer to any segment \nof the population.   Further, AISI holds that EPA\u2019s  referen ce concentration  (RfC) for HCl \nis an appropriate benchmark in establishing an HBEL for HCl.  \nIf you have any questions on  these comments , please do not hesitate to  contact  me at \n202.452.7122. \n \n \n       Sincerely,  \n \n \nPaul Balserak  \nVice President , Environment  \n \n \n \n\n"

    "comment_text": "I am a pediatrician who specializes in environmental health. This proposal seeks to remove the precautionary principle: that if there is a suspected risk of causing harm, protective action should be supported before there is complete scientific proof of a risk. The precautionary principle has long been used to protect human health when there are not enough studies to show harm.\n\nThis proposal doesn't provide enough evidence to show that HCl is not carcinogenic, but then decides to treat HCl as if it is not carcinogenic. The whole section on whether HCl is linear no-threshold, or has a threshold, and whether it could be carcinogenic if it has not threshold, is not logical and has too little supporting data to back up the decisions EPA is making. Saying HCl is not carcinogenic because it only causes hyperplasia which has a threshold, and substances with thresholds are not mutagenic and therefore not carcinogenic, is not logical - because it is the hyperplasia itself that increases the risk of cancer, not mutagenesis. Mutagens are not the only reason substances cause cancer. HCl is suspected of causing cancer by causing hyperplasia. HCl is known to increase hyperplasia, and is strongly suspected to cause cancer because of that, not by mutagenesis. This part of the proposal needs more data and more logic before leaping to conclusions that are not supported by the data provide. And because HCl is suspected of being carcinogenic, but there isn't enough data, the precautionary principle should apply - we should have strong limits until we have data showing it is safe to have less stringent limits.\n\nIt also needs to provide a larger margin of safety for children, who are still growing and whose organs are still forming. Children spend more time outside than adults, and breathe more air for their body size than adults, and they are more vulnerable to toxins because they are still growing and developing. Therefore they need an extra margin of safety and stronger limits. Even if a substance is not a carcinogen, it can still damage children\u2019s health, growth, and development. Please reconsider this proposal, and please get the Scientific Advisory Board to review this proposal and provide advice.",

Regan  Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  EPA Docket Center Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0015 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, DC 20460            Re:    Comments of Waste-to-Energy Association on EPA\u2019s Supplemental Notice  of Proposed Rulemaking: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants \u2013 Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2017-0015   Dear Administrator Regan:   Thank you for the opportunity for the Waste-to-Energy Association (\u201cWTEA\u201d) and its members to provide input into EPA\u2019s supplemental notice of its proposed National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants, 88 Fed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024) (the \u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  WTEA is a national trade organization representing municipal organizations and partnering companies that own and/or operate waste-to-energy (\u201cWTE\u201d) facilities across the United States.  Our members represent the vast majority of the modern WTE facilities that operate nationwide, safely disposing of over 30 million tons of municipal solid waste, while generating 2,500 MW  of renewable electricity using modern combustion technology equipped with state-of-the-art emissions control systems.    1. Use of Health Based Emissions Limit for HCl  WTE facilities use lime in their scrubbers to control SO2 emissions. WTE facilities are also subject to hydrogen chloride (HCl) limits under regulations promulgated by EPA under  Sections 111 and 129 of the Clean Air Act.  See, e.g. 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Eb.  WTEA supports EPA\u2019s proposal to regulate HCl by means of a Health-Based Emissions Limit (\u201cHBEL\u201d) under Section 112(d)(4) in the Proposed Rule for the following reasons:   \n   \n - 2 - \n5600 Connec*cut Ave., NW Washington, DC 20015 202-244-2114 www.wte.org  A. EPA properly concluded that HCl is a threshold pollutant.  89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9091-9094.  B. EPA properly concluded that Sierra Club v. EPA, 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018) does not prevent EPA from issuing an HBEL standard for the reasons EPA sets forth in the preamble to the proposed rule at 9091-9094.    C. EPA reviewed the Hazard Quotient for HCl and properly concluded that the hazards associated with HCl were acceptable with an ample margin of safety; and therefore, it is appropriate to contemplate setting an HBEL under this rule.  Id. at 9093.  Accordingly, WTEA supports the use of an HBEL standard in this rule and urges EPA to promulgate such a similar standard for HCl in regulations that impact WTEA and its members.  2.   Use of an Intra-Quarry Variability Factor for Mercury Emissions  In the Proposed Rule, EPA included an intra-quarry variability (\u201cIQV\u201d) factor to be applied in  its mercury Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) calculations to account for naturally occurring variability in mercury content of raw materials at lime quarries.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9094-95.  WTEA supports the IQV concept.  The \u201craw materials\u201d \u2013 municipal solid waste \u2013 supplied to WTE facilities can also vary considerably, and WTEA believes that an IQV approach is warranted in regulations that EPA is pursuing for our industry.     We fully support the comments of the National Lime Association on HBEL and IQV .  Thank you for your attention to and consideration of these important matters.       Sincerely,          Thomas P.

See 89 Fed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024).  \nDocket ID: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 . \n  \nDear Honorable Administrator Regan,  \n \nThe National Tribal Air Association (NTAA) is pleased to submit this letter to \nprovide comments on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) propos al \nto amend the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime \nManufacturing Plants Amendments. See 89 Fed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024).    \n \nThe NTAA is a member -based organization with 156 Member Tribes. The \norganization\u2019s mission is to advance air quality management policies and programs, \nconsistent with the needs, interests, and unique legal status of American Indian and \nAlaskan Native Tribe s. As such, the NTAA uses its resources to support the efforts \nof all federally recognized Tribes in protecting and improving the air quality within \ntheir respective jurisdictions.  Although  the organization always seeks to represent \nconsensus perspectives on any given issue, it is important to note that the views \nexpressed by the NTAA may not be agreed upon by all Tribes.

Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9 , 202 4) \n(\u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  \nThe A2C is an ad -hoc coalition that comprises the American Chemistry Council, the \nAmerican Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute, the American Forest & Paper Association, the \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the American Iron and Steel Institute, t he \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, the American Wood Council, the National Lime Association, and \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The purpose of the A2C is to advocate for sensible and \neffective federal emissions standards under the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d).  BIA is the national trade \nassociation representing distributors and manufacturers of clay brick and suppliers of related \nproducts and services . \nSome members of the A2C represent c ompanies that own or operate lime \nmanufacturing  affected  facilities that will be subject to the final rule.  In addition, A2C and BIA \nmembers represent a broad swath of domestic manufacturers that are subject to CAA \u00a7 112 \nemissions standards  and, thus, will be affected by the cross -cutting legal and policy \ndeterminations that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) will make in \nthe final rule . \nWe write to support EPA\u2019s proposal to establish health -based emission limit s (\u201cHBEL\u201d) for \nhydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d) emissions .  CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4)  provides that \u201c[w]ith respect to pollutants \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 2 \n \n \nfor which a health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards under \nthis subsection. \u201d  That provision allows EPA to set a less stringent emission limitation  for a \nthreshold hazardous air pollutant (\u201cHAP\u201d) tha n would otherwise be required using the \u201cMACT\u201d \nstandard setting procedures specified in CAA \u00a7 112(d)(2)/(3) , provided that the alternative \nstandard provides an ample margin of safety against po tential health impacts.  Congress thus \nsensibly enabled EPA to avoid unwarranted over -regulation by tailor ing the stringency of an \nemissions limitation  for a given threshold HAP  to the health risks associated with emissions of \nthat HAP from a given source category.  \nEPA has set only a handful  of HBELs  since the current CAA \u00a7 112 air toxics program was \nenacted as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.   We believe that HBELs for HCl \nemissions from lime manufacturing are amply supported by the legal, technical , and scientific \nrecord .  We  strongly support EPA\u2019s proposal to adopt such standards.  \nWe further believe that HBELs can and should be much more widely used to minimize \nunwarranted over -regulation and that EPA should  adopt additional HBELs for many other source \ncategories as part of the periodic technical revie ws required by CAA \u00a7 112(d)(6).  That is \nparticularly true given that EPA has already completed one-time CAA \u00a7 112(f) residual risk \nreviews for most source categories.  EPA observes in the Proposed Rule  that completion of such \nrisk reviews lays a solid foundation for a subsequent HBEL.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093 (\u201c Because the \nhazards associated with HCl were a cceptable with an ample margin of safety in the 2020 RTR, it \nis possible to contemplate setting an HBEL for this rule. \u201d).  Setting HBELs here will set helpful \nprecedent for the program as a whole.  \nBelow, we offer comments supporti ng EPA\u2019s responses to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s objections to \nthe HBEL for HCL that EPA set in 2015.   EPA explains in the Proposed Rule that  \u201cin Sierra Club v. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018)  [\u201cSierra Club \u201d], the court remanded \nthe [HBELs in the]  NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing and for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.   The court identified two specific  concerns.  \nFirst, \u201c[t]he court found that the EPA had not sufficiently supported its determination \nthat HCl is a \u2018\u2018pollutant for which a health threshold has been established\u2019\u2019; specifically, the \ncourt determined that the rulemaking record did not show that HCl is not a carcino gen.\u201d  Id. \nciting  895 F.3d at 11. Second, \u201c[t] he court also stated that the EPA had not sufficiently explained \nwhy it had used the EPA inhalation Reference Concentration (RfC) instead of using California\u2019s \nhealth value in setting the HBEL. \u201d  Id. \nAs explained  below, EPA  provides comprehensive responses to  both concerns in the \nProposed Rule.  As such, EPA has established firm legal and factual bas es for the proposed HCl \nHBELs.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 3 \n \n \nI. CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4) encompasses threshold pollutants , which reasonably include potential \ncarcinogens for which a threshold has been established.  \nWe begin by reasserting the conclusion that EPA reached when it previously set HBELs \nfor HCl emissions from the brick industry \u2013 there is an \u201cabsence of evidence  of carcinogenic \nrisk\u201d related to HCl exposure.  80 Fed. Reg. 65470 , 65488 (Oct. 26, 2015).   As EPA explained at \nthe time, HCl has not \u201c been classified as a carcinogen or as \u2018\u2018suggestive of the potential to be \ncarcinogenic,\u2019\u2019 [] by existing authoritative bodies, including EPA, CalEPA, International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer (IARC), Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), \nand the European Community. \u201d  Id.  In short, the available scientific evidence do es not support a \nconclusion th at HCl is a potential or actual carcinogen.  \nIn the Proposed Rule , EPA avoids the task of trying to \u201cprove a negative\u201d with regard to \nthe question of whether HCl is a carcinogen.  I nstead, EPA appropriately focuses on the more \npertinent  question of whether there is a threshold of exposure below which no significant \nadverse health effects (including cancer) should be expected  due to exposure to HCl .  The \nexistence of such a threshold is, of course, the proper question in deciding whether CAA \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) may be applied and not the wholly different question as to whether a given HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  \nEPA explains that \u201cit is important to acknowledge that the science and methods of \ncancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA amendments were \nissued. \u201d  Id.  The Agency \u201cnow recognizes that carcinogens can be either non -threshold or \nthreshold pollutants\u201d and, as a result, \u201c we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \u201d  Id. \nEPA notes that \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic.\u201d  Id.  EPA proposes to find that \u201c[i]n the case of HCl, the \navailable evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect .\u201d  Id. \nEPA further  explains that \u201c[a]nother important consideration in determining whether a \npollutant has a threshold is understanding whether there are alternative mechanisms by which \nthe observed effects could lead to the development of cancer.\u201d  Id.  For HCl, animal studies show \n\u201cincreased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia \u201d but the animal \nstudies \u201cshowed no evidence of HCl -induced tumors or cancer.\u201d  Id.  Because \u201ccancer cannot \noccur through [hyperplasia] if exposure is below the threshold at which hyperplasia occurs\u201d and \nbecause the Agency \u201cderived a reference concentration (RFC) for HCl which identifies a health -\nbased threshold for hyperplasia \u201d (consistent with the findings of an expert review workshop), \nEPA asks for comment on \u201cwhether it is appropriate to consider HCl a threshold pollutant under \nCAA section 112(d)(4).\u201d  Id. at 9093.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 4 \n \n \nThe A2C and BIA agree with EPA that the proper inquiry under CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4) is \nwhether \u201ca health threshold has been established\u201d for the given HAP .  CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4).  That \nprovision does not use the term s \u201ccancer\u201d or  \u201ccarcinogen\u201d and otherwise does not equate  a \nthreshold pollutant with a carcinogen.  Indeed, the court in Sierra Club  concluded  that \u201c [w]ith \nrespect to scientific conclusions, \"established\" and \"health threshold\" are ambiguous terms and \nwe give deference to the EPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 10.   EPA has authori ty (and an ample factual basis) to reasonably \nconclude that an HBEL may be established for a carcinogen, provided that a health threshold \ncan be set for that compound.  \nNotably, EPA appears to have conceded in Sierra Club  that it \u201cshould not implement \nhealth thresholds in lieu of MACT standards for carcinogenic pollutants.\u201d  Id.  But c onceding that \npoint in Sierra Club  does not prevent or preclude EPA from asserting the different, fact -based \ninterpretation that it has proposed here.  \nIn its comments on the Proposed Rule, the National Lime Association  (\u201cNLA\u201d)  (which, as \nnoted above, is an A2C member) provides extensive commentary and analysis in support of \nEPA\u2019s technical and scientific assertions that, to the extent HCl might be considered a \ncarcinogen, the available evidence supports the conclusion that there is a protective health \nthreshold below which there should be no appreciable risk of developing cancer  to any segment \nof the population.  The A2C and BIA support  NLA\u2019s  comments  on those issues.  \nII. EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl is an appropriate benchmark in establishing an HBEL for HCl.  \nThe second issue raised in Sierra Club  is whether EPA\u2019s RfC is a suitable benchmark for \nsetting an HBEL.  EPA explains that the Sierra Club  court faulted the Agency for \u201c not fully \nexplain [ing]  why the EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl, which the Agency has designated as a \u2018\u2018low confidence\u2019\u2019 \nvalue, was preferable to an alternative value developed by the California EPA, known as the \nchronic reference exposure level (REL). \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093.  \nAccording to the Sierra Club  court, EPA asserted in the Brick MACT rulemaking \u201c that the \n\"low confidence\" label means that it has low confidence in the derivation of the hydrogen \nchloride reference concentration below which no adverse health risks were expected to occur \nbecause the existing data were incomplete and the reference conce ntration is subject to change \nas new data are developed .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 11.   The Agency further asserted \u201c that though \nreference concentrations are assigned high, medium, and low confidence values based on the \nsupporting database, even a low confidence va lue is reliable enough for regulatory use. \u201d  Id.  \nThe court concluded that \u201cEPA\u2019s statement that \u201clow confidence\u201d reference concentrations are \nsuitable for regulatory purposes lacks any supporting reasoning \u201d and that \u201c EPA did not explain \nhow the health threshold could be established if low confidence reference concentrations are \nsubject to change. \u201d  Id. at 12.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 5 \n \n \nIn its response to those issues, EPA asserts in the Proposed Rule that \u201c a \u2018\u2018low \nconfidence\u2019\u2019 RfC  value indicates that it may change if additional supporting data become \navailable \u201d and, thus, \u201c[i] t does not mean that the current available data base is weak or \nunreliable. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093.  EPA points out that \u201c the principal and supporting studies \nselected to derive the RfC for HCl meet the data base criteria for estimation of an RfC which \nmeans that the data base is adequate and acceptable. \u201d  Id.  Those are compelling points that \ndefinitively address the Sierra Club  court\u2019s concerns . \nThe Sierra Club  court  also was concerned with EPA\u2019s explanation  in the Brick MACT \nrulemaking  that \u201cit did not use the California EPA's hydrogen chloride reference concentration \nbecause of its general preference favoring EPA benchmarks.\"  Sierra Club  at 11 (internal cites \nand quotes omitted).  The court concluded that EPA had failed to adequately \u201c explain why low \nconfidence data were enough to demonstrate an \"established\" limit less strict than the \nCalifornia EPA threshold. \u201d  Id. at 12.  \nIn the Proposed Rule , EPA observes that  \u201c[t]he California EPA chronic REL for HCl was \nderived using the same principal and supporting studies \u201d and \u201c[t] herefore, the California EPA \nvalue reflects the same data base confidence as the EPA RfC. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093 .  But \naccording to EPA, \u201c[w] hile the EPA and California EPA values were derived using the same \nprincipal study and similar methodologies, there was a significant difference in the derivation of \neach value, which led to the California EPA value being more stringent.   Id.  EPA states that \n\u201c[t]he principal driver for this difference was the California EPA\u2019s exclusion of mid - respiratory \ntract (i.e., trachea) effects from its dosimetry adjustment calculations. \u201d  Id.  \u201cBy contrast, the \nEPA incorporated both upper - (i.e., nose, mouth) and mid -respiratory tract effects. \u201d  Id.  Upon \nfurther analysis, EPA concludes that its \u201c approach to derive the RfC is more robust because it \nbetter represents the observed respiratory effects reported in the scientific literature. \u201d  Id. \nThat is a rational , fact-based  assessment that materially  supplem ents the rationale the \nAgency relied upon in the Brick MACT rulemaking and clearly provides the additional \ninformation and analysis that the Sierra Club  court found lacking.  EPA\u2019s further explanation of \nits reasoning here is more than adequate to support the use of EPA\u2019s RfC rather than California\u2019s \nvalue.   Arkansas v.

Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9 , 202 4) \n(\u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  \nThe A2C is an ad -hoc coalition that comprises the American Chemistry Council, the \nAmerican Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute, the American Forest & Paper Association, the \nAmerican Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, the American Iron and Steel Institute, t he \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, the American Wood Council, the National Lime Association, and \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The purpose of the A2C is to advocate for sensible and \neffective federal emissions standards under the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d).  BIA is the national trade \nassociation representing distributors and manufacturers of clay brick and suppliers of related \nproducts and services . \nSome members of the A2C represent c ompanies that own or operate lime \nmanufacturing  affected  facilities that will be subject to the final rule.  In addition, A2C and BIA \nmembers represent a broad swath of domestic manufacturers that are subject to CAA \u00a7 112 \nemissions standards  and, thus, will be affected by the cross -cutting legal and policy \ndeterminations that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d) will make in \nthe final rule . \nWe write to support EPA\u2019s proposal to establish health -based emission limit s (\u201cHBEL\u201d) for \nhydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d) emissions .  CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4)  provides that \u201c[w]ith respect to pollutants \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 2 \n \n \nfor which a health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards under \nthis subsection. \u201d  That provision allows EPA to set a less stringent emission limitation  for a \nthreshold hazardous air pollutant (\u201cHAP\u201d) tha n would otherwise be required using the \u201cMACT\u201d \nstandard setting procedures specified in CAA \u00a7 112(d)(2)/(3) , provided that the alternative \nstandard provides an ample margin of safety against po tential health impacts.  Congress thus \nsensibly enabled EPA to avoid unwarranted over -regulation by tailor ing the stringency of an \nemissions limitation  for a given threshold HAP  to the health risks associated with emissions of \nthat HAP from a given source category.  \nEPA has set only a handful  of HBELs  since the current CAA \u00a7 112 air toxics program was \nenacted as part of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.   We believe that HBELs for HCl \nemissions from lime manufacturing are amply supported by the legal, technical , and scientific \nrecord .  We  strongly support EPA\u2019s proposal to adopt such standards.  \nWe further believe that HBELs can and should be much more widely used to minimize \nunwarranted over -regulation and that EPA should  adopt additional HBELs for many other source \ncategories as part of the periodic technical revie ws required by CAA \u00a7 112(d)(6).  That is \nparticularly true given that EPA has already completed one-time CAA \u00a7 112(f) residual risk \nreviews for most source categories.  EPA observes in the Proposed Rule  that completion of such \nrisk reviews lays a solid foundation for a subsequent HBEL.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093 (\u201c Because the \nhazards associated with HCl were a cceptable with an ample margin of safety in the 2020 RTR, it \nis possible to contemplate setting an HBEL for this rule. \u201d).  Setting HBELs here will set helpful \nprecedent for the program as a whole.  \nBelow, we offer comments supporti ng EPA\u2019s responses to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s objections to \nthe HBEL for HCL that EPA set in 2015.   EPA explains in the Proposed Rule that  \u201cin Sierra Club v. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018)  [\u201cSierra Club \u201d], the court remanded \nthe [HBELs in the]  NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing and for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.   The court identified two specific  concerns.  \nFirst, \u201c[t]he court found that the EPA had not sufficiently supported its determination \nthat HCl is a \u2018\u2018pollutant for which a health threshold has been established\u2019\u2019; specifically, the \ncourt determined that the rulemaking record did not show that HCl is not a carcino gen.\u201d  Id. \nciting  895 F.3d at 11. Second, \u201c[t] he court also stated that the EPA had not sufficiently explained \nwhy it had used the EPA inhalation Reference Concentration (RfC) instead of using California\u2019s \nhealth value in setting the HBEL. \u201d  Id. \nAs explained  below, EPA  provides comprehensive responses to  both concerns in the \nProposed Rule.  As such, EPA has established firm legal and factual bas es for the proposed HCl \nHBELs.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 3 \n \n \nI. CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4) encompasses threshold pollutants , which reasonably include potential \ncarcinogens for which a threshold has been established.  \nWe begin by reasserting the conclusion that EPA reached when it previously set HBELs \nfor HCl emissions from the brick industry \u2013 there is an \u201cabsence of evidence  of carcinogenic \nrisk\u201d related to HCl exposure.  80 Fed. Reg. 65470 , 65488 (Oct. 26, 2015).   As EPA explained at \nthe time, HCl has not \u201c been classified as a carcinogen or as \u2018\u2018suggestive of the potential to be \ncarcinogenic,\u2019\u2019 [] by existing authoritative bodies, including EPA, CalEPA, International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer (IARC), Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), \nand the European Community. \u201d  Id.  In short, the available scientific evidence do es not support a \nconclusion th at HCl is a potential or actual carcinogen.  \nIn the Proposed Rule , EPA avoids the task of trying to \u201cprove a negative\u201d with regard to \nthe question of whether HCl is a carcinogen.  I nstead, EPA appropriately focuses on the more \npertinent  question of whether there is a threshold of exposure below which no significant \nadverse health effects (including cancer) should be expected  due to exposure to HCl .  The \nexistence of such a threshold is, of course, the proper question in deciding whether CAA \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) may be applied and not the wholly different question as to whether a given HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  \nEPA explains that \u201cit is important to acknowledge that the science and methods of \ncancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA amendments were \nissued. \u201d  Id.  The Agency \u201cnow recognizes that carcinogens can be either non -threshold or \nthreshold pollutants\u201d and, as a result, \u201c we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \u201d  Id. \nEPA notes that \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic.\u201d  Id.  EPA proposes to find that \u201c[i]n the case of HCl, the \navailable evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect .\u201d  Id. \nEPA further  explains that \u201c[a]nother important consideration in determining whether a \npollutant has a threshold is understanding whether there are alternative mechanisms by which \nthe observed effects could lead to the development of cancer.\u201d  Id.  For HCl, animal studies show \n\u201cincreased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia \u201d but the animal \nstudies \u201cshowed no evidence of HCl -induced tumors or cancer.\u201d  Id.  Because \u201ccancer cannot \noccur through [hyperplasia] if exposure is below the threshold at which hyperplasia occurs\u201d and \nbecause the Agency \u201cderived a reference concentration (RFC) for HCl which identifies a health -\nbased threshold for hyperplasia \u201d (consistent with the findings of an expert review workshop), \nEPA asks for comment on \u201cwhether it is appropriate to consider HCl a threshold pollutant under \nCAA section 112(d)(4).\u201d  Id. at 9093.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 4 \n \n \nThe A2C and BIA agree with EPA that the proper inquiry under CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4) is \nwhether \u201ca health threshold has been established\u201d for the given HAP .  CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4).  That \nprovision does not use the term s \u201ccancer\u201d or  \u201ccarcinogen\u201d and otherwise does not equate  a \nthreshold pollutant with a carcinogen.  Indeed, the court in Sierra Club  concluded  that \u201c [w]ith \nrespect to scientific conclusions, \"established\" and \"health threshold\" are ambiguous terms and \nwe give deference to the EPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 10.   EPA has authori ty (and an ample factual basis) to reasonably \nconclude that an HBEL may be established for a carcinogen, provided that a health threshold \ncan be set for that compound.  \nNotably, EPA appears to have conceded in Sierra Club  that it \u201cshould not implement \nhealth thresholds in lieu of MACT standards for carcinogenic pollutants.\u201d  Id.  But c onceding that \npoint in Sierra Club  does not prevent or preclude EPA from asserting the different, fact -based \ninterpretation that it has proposed here.  \nIn its comments on the Proposed Rule, the National Lime Association  (\u201cNLA\u201d)  (which, as \nnoted above, is an A2C member) provides extensive commentary and analysis in support of \nEPA\u2019s technical and scientific assertions that, to the extent HCl might be considered a \ncarcinogen, the available evidence supports the conclusion that there is a protective health \nthreshold below which there should be no appreciable risk of developing cancer  to any segment \nof the population.  The A2C and BIA support  NLA\u2019s  comments  on those issues.  \nII. EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl is an appropriate benchmark in establishing an HBEL for HCl.  \nThe second issue raised in Sierra Club  is whether EPA\u2019s RfC is a suitable benchmark for \nsetting an HBEL.  EPA explains that the Sierra Club  court faulted the Agency for \u201c not fully \nexplain [ing]  why the EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl, which the Agency has designated as a \u2018\u2018low confidence\u2019\u2019 \nvalue, was preferable to an alternative value developed by the California EPA, known as the \nchronic reference exposure level (REL). \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093.  \nAccording to the Sierra Club  court, EPA asserted in the Brick MACT rulemaking \u201c that the \n\"low confidence\" label means that it has low confidence in the derivation of the hydrogen \nchloride reference concentration below which no adverse health risks were expected to occur \nbecause the existing data were incomplete and the reference conce ntration is subject to change \nas new data are developed .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 11.   The Agency further asserted \u201c that though \nreference concentrations are assigned high, medium, and low confidence values based on the \nsupporting database, even a low confidence va lue is reliable enough for regulatory use. \u201d  Id.  \nThe court concluded that \u201cEPA\u2019s statement that \u201clow confidence\u201d reference concentrations are \nsuitable for regulatory purposes lacks any supporting reasoning \u201d and that \u201c EPA did not explain \nhow the health threshold could be established if low confidence reference concentrations are \nsubject to change. \u201d  Id. at 12.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 5 \n \n \nIn its response to those issues, EPA asserts in the Proposed Rule that \u201c a \u2018\u2018low \nconfidence\u2019\u2019 RfC  value indicates that it may change if additional supporting data become \navailable \u201d and, thus, \u201c[i] t does not mean that the current available data base is weak or \nunreliable. \u201d  89 Fed.

Circuit\u2019s objections to \nthe HBEL for HCL that EPA set in 2015.   EPA explains in the Proposed Rule that  \u201cin Sierra Club v. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018)  [\u201cSierra Club \u201d], the court remanded \nthe [HBELs in the]  NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing and for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.   The court identified two specific  concerns.  \nFirst, \u201c[t]he court found that the EPA had not sufficiently supported its determination \nthat HCl is a \u2018\u2018pollutant for which a health threshold has been established\u2019\u2019; specifically, the \ncourt determined that the rulemaking record did not show that HCl is not a carcino gen.\u201d  Id. \nciting  895 F.3d at 11. Second, \u201c[t] he court also stated that the EPA had not sufficiently explained \nwhy it had used the EPA inhalation Reference Concentration (RfC) instead of using California\u2019s \nhealth value in setting the HBEL. \u201d  Id. \nAs explained  below, EPA  provides comprehensive responses to  both concerns in the \nProposed Rule.  As such, EPA has established firm legal and factual bas es for the proposed HCl \nHBELs.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 3 \n \n \nI. CAA \u00a7 112(d)(4) encompasses threshold pollutants , which reasonably include potential \ncarcinogens for which a threshold has been established.  \nWe begin by reasserting the conclusion that EPA reached when it previously set HBELs \nfor HCl emissions from the brick industry \u2013 there is an \u201cabsence of evidence  of carcinogenic \nrisk\u201d related to HCl exposure.  80 Fed. Reg. 65470 , 65488 (Oct. 26, 2015).   As EPA explained at \nthe time, HCl has not \u201c been classified as a carcinogen or as \u2018\u2018suggestive of the potential to be \ncarcinogenic,\u2019\u2019 [] by existing authoritative bodies, including EPA, CalEPA, International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer (IARC), Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD), \nand the European Community. \u201d  Id.  In short, the available scientific evidence do es not support a \nconclusion th at HCl is a potential or actual carcinogen.  \nIn the Proposed Rule , EPA avoids the task of trying to \u201cprove a negative\u201d with regard to \nthe question of whether HCl is a carcinogen.  I nstead, EPA appropriately focuses on the more \npertinent  question of whether there is a threshold of exposure below which no significant \nadverse health effects (including cancer) should be expected  due to exposure to HCl .  The \nexistence of such a threshold is, of course, the proper question in deciding whether CAA \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) may be applied and not the wholly different question as to whether a given HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  \nEPA explains that \u201cit is important to acknowledge that the science and methods of \ncancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA amendments were \nissued. \u201d  Id.  The Agency \u201cnow recognizes that carcinogens can be either non -threshold or \nthreshold pollutants\u201d and, as a result, \u201c we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \u201d  Id. \nEPA notes that \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic.\u201d  Id.  EPA proposes to find that \u201c[i]n the case of HCl, the \navailable evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect .\u201d  Id. \nEPA further  explains that \u201c[a]nother important consideration in determining whether a \npollutant has a threshold is understanding whether there are alternative mechanisms by which \nthe observed effects could lead to the development of cancer.\u201d  Id.  For HCl, animal studies show \n\u201cincreased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia \u201d but the animal \nstudies \u201cshowed no evidence of HCl -induced tumors or cancer.\u201d  Id.  Because \u201ccancer cannot \noccur through [hyperplasia] if exposure is below the threshold at which hyperplasia occurs\u201d and \nbecause the Agency \u201cderived a reference concentration (RFC) for HCl which identifies a health -\nbased threshold for hyperplasia \u201d (consistent with the findings of an expert review workshop), \nEPA asks for comment on \u201cwhether it is appropriate to consider HCl a threshold pollutant under \nCAA section 112(d)(4).\u201d  Id. at 9093.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 4 \n \n \nThe A2C and BIA agree with EPA that the proper inquiry under CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4) is \nwhether \u201ca health threshold has been established\u201d for the given HAP .  CAA \u00a7  112(d)(4).  That \nprovision does not use the term s \u201ccancer\u201d or  \u201ccarcinogen\u201d and otherwise does not equate  a \nthreshold pollutant with a carcinogen.  Indeed, the court in Sierra Club  concluded  that \u201c [w]ith \nrespect to scientific conclusions, \"established\" and \"health threshold\" are ambiguous terms and \nwe give deference to the EPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 10.   EPA has authori ty (and an ample factual basis) to reasonably \nconclude that an HBEL may be established for a carcinogen, provided that a health threshold \ncan be set for that compound.  \nNotably, EPA appears to have conceded in Sierra Club  that it \u201cshould not implement \nhealth thresholds in lieu of MACT standards for carcinogenic pollutants.\u201d  Id.  But c onceding that \npoint in Sierra Club  does not prevent or preclude EPA from asserting the different, fact -based \ninterpretation that it has proposed here.  \nIn its comments on the Proposed Rule, the National Lime Association  (\u201cNLA\u201d)  (which, as \nnoted above, is an A2C member) provides extensive commentary and analysis in support of \nEPA\u2019s technical and scientific assertions that, to the extent HCl might be considered a \ncarcinogen, the available evidence supports the conclusion that there is a protective health \nthreshold below which there should be no appreciable risk of developing cancer  to any segment \nof the population.  The A2C and BIA support  NLA\u2019s  comments  on those issues.  \nII. EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl is an appropriate benchmark in establishing an HBEL for HCl.  \nThe second issue raised in Sierra Club  is whether EPA\u2019s RfC is a suitable benchmark for \nsetting an HBEL.  EPA explains that the Sierra Club  court faulted the Agency for \u201c not fully \nexplain [ing]  why the EPA\u2019s RfC for HCl, which the Agency has designated as a \u2018\u2018low confidence\u2019\u2019 \nvalue, was preferable to an alternative value developed by the California EPA, known as the \nchronic reference exposure level (REL). \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093.  \nAccording to the Sierra Club  court, EPA asserted in the Brick MACT rulemaking \u201c that the \n\"low confidence\" label means that it has low confidence in the derivation of the hydrogen \nchloride reference concentration below which no adverse health risks were expected to occur \nbecause the existing data were incomplete and the reference conce ntration is subject to change \nas new data are developed .\u201d  Sierra Club  at 11.   The Agency further asserted \u201c that though \nreference concentrations are assigned high, medium, and low confidence values based on the \nsupporting database, even a low confidence va lue is reliable enough for regulatory use. \u201d  Id.  \nThe court concluded that \u201cEPA\u2019s statement that \u201clow confidence\u201d reference concentrations are \nsuitable for regulatory purposes lacks any supporting reasoning \u201d and that \u201c EPA did not explain \nhow the health threshold could be established if low confidence reference concentrations are \nsubject to change. \u201d  Id. at 12.  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 5 \n \n \nIn its response to those issues, EPA asserts in the Proposed Rule that \u201c a \u2018\u2018low \nconfidence\u2019\u2019 RfC  value indicates that it may change if additional supporting data become \navailable \u201d and, thus, \u201c[i] t does not mean that the current available data base is weak or \nunreliable. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093.  EPA points out that \u201c the principal and supporting studies \nselected to derive the RfC for HCl meet the data base criteria for estimation of an RfC which \nmeans that the data base is adequate and acceptable. \u201d  Id.  Those are compelling points that \ndefinitively address the Sierra Club  court\u2019s concerns . \nThe Sierra Club  court  also was concerned with EPA\u2019s explanation  in the Brick MACT \nrulemaking  that \u201cit did not use the California EPA's hydrogen chloride reference concentration \nbecause of its general preference favoring EPA benchmarks.\"  Sierra Club  at 11 (internal cites \nand quotes omitted).  The court concluded that EPA had failed to adequately \u201c explain why low \nconfidence data were enough to demonstrate an \"established\" limit less strict than the \nCalifornia EPA threshold. \u201d  Id. at 12.  \nIn the Proposed Rule , EPA observes that  \u201c[t]he California EPA chronic REL for HCl was \nderived using the same principal and supporting studies \u201d and \u201c[t] herefore, the California EPA \nvalue reflects the same data base confidence as the EPA RfC. \u201d  89 Fed. Reg. at 9093 .  But \naccording to EPA, \u201c[w] hile the EPA and California EPA values were derived using the same \nprincipal study and similar methodologies, there was a significant difference in the derivation of \neach value, which led to the California EPA value being more stringent.   Id.  EPA states that \n\u201c[t]he principal driver for this difference was the California EPA\u2019s exclusion of mid - respiratory \ntract (i.e., trachea) effects from its dosimetry adjustment calculations. \u201d  Id.  \u201cBy contrast, the \nEPA incorporated both upper - (i.e., nose, mouth) and mid -respiratory tract effects. \u201d  Id.  Upon \nfurther analysis, EPA concludes that its \u201c approach to derive the RfC is more robust because it \nbetter represents the observed respiratory effects reported in the scientific literature. \u201d  Id. \nThat is a rational , fact-based  assessment that materially  supplem ents the rationale the \nAgency relied upon in the Brick MACT rulemaking and clearly provides the additional \ninformation and analysis that the Sierra Club  court found lacking.  EPA\u2019s further explanation of \nits reasoning here is more than adequate to support the use of EPA\u2019s RfC rather than California\u2019s \nvalue.   Arkansas v. Oklahoma , 503 U.S. 91, 113 (1992) . \n \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  \n \n  \nMr. Brian Storey  \nMarch 11, 2024  \nPage 6 \n \n \nThank you again for the opportunity to submit these comments.

The Clean Air Act does not require EPA to regulate additional hazardous air pollutants in \nthis proceeding, and EPA should have determined that such a regulation is unnecessary.  \n \n2. EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  will impose billi ons of dollars in economic costs on the lime \nindustry with  minimal benefits. In addition, not only will the Proposed Rule  impose \ntremendous costs, but it will also cause more environmental harm than good.  \n3. EPA should not have sought to set MACT floors for any of the HAPs addressed in the \nProposed Rule , because no lime industry source is controlling for any of these HAPs, and \nthus there are no true \u201cbest performers\u201d in terms of emissions.  \n4. Any standard for HCl should be a health- based standard pursuant to Clean Air Act \nsection 112(d)(4) . NLA commends EPA for seeking comment on this approach but  \nbelieves it should have been the proposed approach. \n \n5. NLA commends EPA for proposing a n intra-quarry variability f actor  (IQV)  for mercury \nemissions but  believes that the data compels a higher  IQV factor . \n \n6. NLA commends EPA for proposing an aggregated organic HAP standard, but believes the proposed standard requires correction . \n \n7. EPA should withdraw its proposed dioxins/furans ( D/F) standard and either collect \nadditional data on D/F emissions in the lime industry before proceeding with a new \nemissions standard or provide the  work practice or alternative compliance method \npreviously requested by NLA .  \n \nThese and other concerns are addressed in detail below.  \n PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nEPA promulgated the National Emis sion Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for \nLime Manufacturing Plants F inal R ule two decades ago . 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080- 7083. In doing so, \nEPA  noted that: \"the purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health by reducing \nemissions of HAP f rom lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394, 395 (Jan. 5, 2004). EPA \ncarefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector, and regulated HAP emissions by establishing a particulate matter (PM) standard as a surrogate for non- volatile and semi- volatile metal HAP s. \nEPA  fulfilled  its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibil ity Act and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA)  by reaching out to small lime companies, \nperforming extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a small \nbusiness panel with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to identify  less burdensome \n \n1 Some of the comments herein mirror comments included in NLA\u2019s comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \ndated Feb. 21, 2023 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015 -0166) . NLA incorporates those comments and their appendices \nherein by reference, but some of the  points  are repeated here for ease of review . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 3 alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s  regulatory objectives. EPA  also provided a 60- day \ncomment period.  \n \nEPA\u2019s  focus was on protecting public health by reducing HAP emissions  with controls , \nbut only if such controls were \u201cnecessary. \u201d EPA considered, but expressly rejected , regulating \nother HAPs, including the ones at issue in this rulemaking. For example, EPA determined that :  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions f rom lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the \nauthority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is \nnecessary because HCl is a \u201chealth threshold pollutant\u201d and HCl levels emitted from lime \nkilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety.  \n \n69 Fed. Reg. at 397. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was successful in balancing its obligations under the CAA to protect \npublic health while only imposing controls that were \u201cnecessary.\u201d This is evidenced by the fact that the rule was not challenged by the lime industry nor by any environmental groups.  \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA  issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(6) and (f)(2), a.k.a. the \u201crisk and technology review \u201d (RTR).  Here EPA found that : \u201crisks \nare acceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 44960 (July 24, 2020) . EPA further \ndetermined that: \u201cThere are no develop ments in practices, p rocesses, or control technologies that \nnecessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id .  \n \nEPA took a completely different approach in the January 2023 Proposed Rule , and \nlargely continues this approach in the current Proposed Rule . In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \nEPA proposed extremely stringent requirements that would have imposed enormous costs on the \nlime industry. After this was pointed out in comments by NLA and its members, and by the Small Business Administration  (SBA), EPA agreed that it needed to perform a more detailed \nanalysis of the cost impacts of the rule on small businesses. EPA and SBA convened a review \npanel under the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Enforcement Act (SBREFA), which was held on August 3, 2023. Aft er the panel procedure, EPA proceeded to issue the current Proposed \nRule, which incorporates many of the recommendations made through the panel process.  \n NLA commends EPA for participating in the SBREFA review  and for responding to \nconcerns raised during the process . NLA also notes that EPA\u2019s estimate of the costs of the new \nProposed Rule are more realistic and  much higher than those estimated for the January 2023 \nProposed Rule. These high costs, coupled with EPA\u2019s repeated determinations that the existing rule presents acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety, even with no new standards, are \nwhat has led NLA , as well as the Small Business Panel,  to ur ge EPA to identify as many ways to \nminimize the impact of the Proposed Rule on the lime industry as possible. \n EPA is not pursuing this rulemaking process because of risks to the public or the \nenvironment, but because of court decisions  that are imposing unnecessary  deadlines and \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 4 substantive requirements that are nowhere found in \u00a7 112(d)(6) of the Clean Air Act .2 Despite \nthe fact that EPA has consistently determined for over two decades that risks from lime plant \nemissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and thus that additional MACT regulations for the lime industry sector are unnecessary , EPA  is pushing to complete this \nrulemaking as soon as possible because of  a court -ordered deadline of June 30, 2024, for the \npromulgation of a final rule to regulate four additional pollutants whether EPA believes new standards are necessary or not.  TECHNICAL BACKGROUND  \n The Proposed Rule continues to reflect a lack of technical understanding of  the lime \nindustry in several important respects . Below is a discussion providing technical background on \nhow lime kilns and their HAP emissions interact. Specifically, the discussion below relates to the four additional HAP s addressed in the Proposed Rule : HCl (hydrogen chloride), Hg (mercury), \noHAP (organic Hazardous Air Pollutants), and D/F (dioxins and furans).   \n Lime  kilns differ substantially from  traditional fuel combustion sources and  kilns from \nother industrial sectors in how HAPs are emitted and controlled. For example, fossil fuel -fired \nboilers and heaters and  tunnel kilns used to manufacture brick or ceramics exhibit significantly \ndifferent  emissions formation phenomenon and emissions gas stream characteristics from those \nfound in lime kilns , and thus basing assumptions on performance of these devices, as EPA \nappears to have done, has led  to errors in analysis, and the failure to consider important factors \nthat will affect cost and performance of air pollution control devices in lime plants .\n3 The \noperation of these non- lime sources differ substantially from the operation of lime plants, in \nparticular with respect to the temperature s necessary to achieve calcination  in a lime kiln  and the \nlong- life requirements of lime plant design and operation near a quarry. These non- lime sources \nare further  not involved in continuously operating process es in a lime plant that have many tons \nper hour of a circulating product load. These operational realities, formation mechanisms, and exhaust gas stream characteristics are very dif ferent  for a lime kiln than for a typical combustion \ndevice or tunnel kiln. Comparison with cement kilns can also lead to erroneous conclusions, because cement kilns differ substantially from lime kilns due to the variety of feedstocks and fuels, and the differences in processes . Below is a brief discussion for each newly regulated \nHAP.  \n \n\u2022 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) .  The formation of HCl is incidental to the lime production \nprocess and is a function of the temperatures required to make lime, the fuels used for their energy value, and constituents found in the raw material input (limestone) to the \n \n2 Despite meeting its obligations of CAA \u00a7 112(d)(6) and (f)(2) by issuing a final  RTR rule in 2020, EPA takes the \nposition that it must issue a new rule following the decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA , \n955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (\u201cLEAN \u201d). As set forth in these comments,  EPA misinterprets LEAN  to require a \nrevised standard here despite EPA\u2019s RTR findings of no residual risks or available new technologies. Further, even \nif EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN  was correct, NLA asserts that the LEAN case was wrongly decided and should be \nrevisited and reversed by the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court.  \n3 NLA recognizes  that EPA in the Supplemental Proposed Rule has substantially revised its costs estimates to better \nalign with industry\u2019s cost estimates. Nevertheless, there remain  substantial technical uncertainties  as to whether  any \nof the candidate MACT technologies will achieve the proposed limit s and therefore even EPA\u2019s increased cost \nestimates incorporate significant economic uncertainty.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 5 kilns. Given that the lime kiln process is alkaline in nature, its environment already \noffers an inherent reduction of acid gas emissions, including HCl, without any additional controls. The proposed MACT standard starts from a floor that is based on the few lowest emitting sources and then proceeds to require the installation of expensive controls to attempt to reduce very low levels to even lower levels without conclusive data on the feasibility  of those controls.   \n \n\u2022 Mercury.   Emissions of mercury are low from lime kilns. Mercury  can be emitted in \neither its elemental or ionic (oxidized) form at ratios that will require extensive study and design controls for lime kilns subject to the rule. Unlike typical combustion systems, where emitted mercury  is solely a function of levels  in fuels, a lime kiln also \ncan see contributions to emissions from trace levels of mercury that naturally occur in limestone. The large quarries  at lime plants  have natural variability in such tra ce \ncompounds. Given the requirement that large volumes of stone are necessary to make lime and the long-term capital investment needed to build and operate a lime plant, most lime plants are located near their limestone source with decades -long \noperational and mining plans. NLA produced and provided to EPA significant volumes of data on mercury, and demonstrated how EPA should apply an int ra-\nquarry variability (IQV) factor to account for variability of mercury in stone feedstocks.    \n \n\u2022 Organic HAPs .  Emissions of organic HAPs from lime kilns are very low in quantity \nand in the number of individual HAPs. These organic HAPs can be formed incidentally during combustion in the kiln  and can also be formed by miniscule \namounts of naturally occurring organics contained in limestone that decompose at lower temperatures and randomly form organic HAPs. To address these very small amounts of organic HAPs, EPA previously proposed to set a MACT floor for total hydrocarbons (THC) as a surrogate. EPA has now proposed a superior aggregated oHAP approach, although, as detailed below, it requires some important corrections .   \n \n\u2022 Dioxins and Furans.  Dioxins and furans ( D/F) are emitted in extremely low \nquantities  from lime kilns , and in some cases are not detectable at all . Many lime \nkilns affected by this rule may  not have detectable levels of D/F and yet will be \nsubject to burdensome testing in perpetuity. The formation of D/F is incidental in a lime kiln where organics and chlorides are  available to form barely detectable levels \nof D/F  (in the part s per billion range) in some kilns. Despite EPA\u2019s own studies and \ndocumentation in the prior Lime MACT and RTR rulemakings confirming the extremely low level s of D/F from lime kilns, EPA has proposed the most stringent \nlimit available .   \n       \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 6 GENERAL ISSUES  \n \nI. THE CLEAN AIR ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE  EPA TO REGULATE \nADDITIONAL  HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS IN THIS PROCEEDING  \n \nThere are two key reasons why EPA should not be engaged in this rulemaking. First, any \nlawsuits or petitions demanding revisions to the underlying lime MACT standard are time -\nbarred, and thus EPA is under no legal obligation to engage in this rulemaking. Second, even if \nnot time -barred, it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d in this residual risk and technology (RTR) proceeding to \nissue four new  MACT standard s. \n \nA. EPA Should Not Have Undertaken to Rewrite the Lime Manufacturing \nMACT Standard Because All Parties Are Time- Barred from Challenging \nThat Standard  \n EPA is undertaking this revision to the existing lime MACT standard in this RTR \nproceeding because environmental petitioners requested that it do so following the DC Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Louisiana Environmental Action Network  v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(\u201cLEAN \u201d). However,  environmental petitioners are time -barred from challenging the underlying \nlime MACT standard because they failed to do so within 60 days  following promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard in 2004, and thus there is no legal obligation for EPA to undertake this \nrulemaking.  \n \nSection 307(b) of the Clean Air Act requires any party to initiate a challenge for EPA\u2019s \nfailure to set hazardous air pollutant (HAP) standards within 60 days from promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(b)(1). This requirement is juri sdictional, and a court \ncannot waive or lengthen it. Med . Waste Inst. & Energy Recovery Council v. EPA , 645 F.3d 420, \n427 (D.C. Cir. 2011); NRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The LEAN  court \nacknowledged the argument but  did not address it o r rule on its merits.  This limitation on \njudicial review of EPA actions serves an \u201cimportant reason: to enforce repose so that the rulemaking process is not crippled by surprise challenges to matters that were rightfully presumed settled  . . .\u201d EME Homer City Generation, L .P. v. EPA, 696 F.3d 7, 38 (D.C. Cir. \n2012), rev\u2019d on other grounds , 572 U.S. 489 (2014) (Rogers, J., dissenting). Further, this \njurisdictional timeline protects the regulated industry by allowing industry to plan for compliance obligatio ns. Cf. Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA , 647 F.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (observing \nthat the CAA\u2019s strict deadlines for completing the steps to promulgate ambient air quality standards, and the limitation on stays pending petitions for reconsideration in CAA section \n307(d)(7)(B), are evide nce of \u201ca strong congressional desire that the procedure for establishing \nair quality standards be completed expeditiously and with considerable finality\u201d).  \n \nHere, the underlying lime MACT standard was promulgated in 2004, 69 Fed. Reg. 394 \n(Jan. 5, 2004). The challenge to EPA\u2019s RTR rule  (challenging EPA\u2019s decision not to regulate \nadditional HAPs in the original MACT rule)  was not filed until September 22, 2020, over 16 \nyears beyond the 60- day judicial review period established by Congress. Accordingly, any \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 7 challenge to the existing MACT standard would be time -barred, and thus EPA is under no legal \nobligation to initiate this rulemaking.4  \n \nFurthermore, the time bar argument is stronger in the context of the lime MACT standard \nthan it was in the LEAN  case, because all the pollutants addressed in this new rulemaking were \nexplicitly addressed in the original lime MACT rulemaking in 2004. This is not a case in which HAPs were ignored or inadvertently omitted, but rather a case in which EPA specifically  decided \nthat regulation was not necessary, a decision that was not challenged at the time. \n Thus, for HC l, in the 2004 MACT rule, EPA explicitly  performed a review under CAA \nsection 112(d)(4). Below is what EPA stated in the final rule preamble:  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions from lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the authority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is necessary because HCl is a \u2018\u2018health threshold pollutant,\u2019\u2019 and HCl levels emitted fr om \nlime kilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety. See generally, \n67 FR 78054\u2013057. As explained there, the risk analysis sought to assure that emissions from every source in the category result in exposures less than the threshol d level even \nfor an individual exposed at the upper end of the exposure distribution. The upper end of the exposure distribution is calculated using the \u2018\u2018high end exposure estimate,\u2019\u2019 defined as a plausible estimate of individual exposure for those persons at the upper end of the exposure distribution, conceptually above the 90th percentile, but not higher than the individual in the population who has the highest exposure. We believe that assuring protection to persons at the upper end of the exposure dist ribution is consistent with the \n\u2018\u2018ample margin of safety\u2019\u2019 requirement in section 112(d)(4). In the proposed rule, we published the results of the risk analysis on which we based this decision. More information on the risk analysis may be found in the publ ished proposed rule (67 FR \n78054\u201378057) and in the docket. We received only one comment on our risk analysis. \n 69 Fed. Reg. 398.\n5  \n \nEPA explicitly state d that it was  making this determination under the authority of section \n112(d)(4) \u2014it is not a matter of EPA  simply deciding that it did not need to regulate HCl because \nof low risk. Because EPA explicitly found in 2004 that HCl was a threshold pollutant, and that the criteria of section 112(d)(4) were satisfied \u2014and no one challenged the rule \u2014any legal \nchallenge to that determination is now time -barred.  \n  EPA also addressed mercury in the 2004 rule preamble, choosing not to issue a mercury \nstandard because: \u201cThe only control technique would reflect control of the raw materials and/or fossil fuels. This control is not duplicable or replicable. We also determined that an emissions \n \n4 To the extent that the LEAN  court could be deemed to have ruled against the time bar argument, NLA respectfully \nsubmits that the case was wrongly decided, for the reasons stated in these comments. The decision was not appealed \nby any party. NLA was not a party, but rather an amicus in that case , and thus was not able to appeal the decision.  \n5 See docket items EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0767 and EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0768 for more information on \nthe extensive risk assessment performed for HCl in the original lime MACT rule.  NLA incorporates those \ndocuments into these comments by reference.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 8 limit for mercury based on a beyond- the-MACT -floor option is not justified after consideration \nof the cost, energy, and non- environmental impacts.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 398. EPA received no adverse \ncomments on this approach and the final rule was not challenged.  \n \n For organics and dioxins/furans, EPA\u2019s technical contractor explained the decision not to \nissue standards in a memorandum in the docket. EPA \u2019s contractor  stated that there was \nessentially no data suggesting organics were emitted . The contractor stated that after a review of \nemissions test data, \u201c[o]nly one test reported any emissions of organic HAPs from lime manufacturing\u2026\u201d Docket No. A -95-41, Item No. II-B-121 at 1. For dioxins and furans, the \ncontractor stated : \u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners a re well -documented, but are shown \nto be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not collected in this search.\u201d Id. \n  Thus, EPA addressed all these HAPs in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and its \ndeterminations were unchallenged until this effort to bootstrap such challenges into the RTR rulemaking. EPA should rely on its prior reasonable decisions , should withdraw the Proposed \nRule  and should reject any effort to bring challenges as  legally time -barred.  \n \nB. EPA Should Not Revise the MACT Standard for Lime Manufacturing \nBecause it is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d to Do So, Given EPA\u2019s RTR Findings of No \nResidual Risks or  Available New Technologies  \n \nThe LEAN court held that \u201c\u2026because the Act necessitates section 112 compliant \nemission standards for each source category, and section 112(d)(6) requires EPA at least every \neight years to review and revise emissions standards \u2018as necessary,\u2019 EPA\u2019s section 112(d)(6)  \nreview of a source category\u2019s emission standard must address all listed air toxics the source category emits.\u201d LEAN , 955 F.3d at 1091. U nder that decision, EPA must \u201c address\u201d  whether any \nfurther regulation of listed air toxics is \u201c necessary ,\u201d in its discr etion. For lime manufacturing , \nEPA already \u201caddressed\u201d this in 2004, and found, in promulgating the lime RTR standard, that \nthere were no residual risks  and no technological advances of note, and therefore  no reason to \nrevise the MACT standard for the source category. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44965- 66. EPA\u2019s own \nscientific assessment confirmed this determination in 2020 when it found lime emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety. Hence, EPA in its discretion may, and in NLA\u2019s opinion, must reasonably conclude that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d to revise the MACT standard any further, consistent with LEAN.\n6 \n \n6 Notwithstanding LEAN,  the plain language of s ection 112(d)(6) requires only technology review. Therefore, \nsection 112(d)(6) cannot be used to address  unregulated HAPs from a MACT standard \u2013  other provisions of the \nstatute ( sections 112(d)(2) and (3)) fulfill that purpose. Section 112(d)(6) is meant to be a review only of any \ntechnological advances in the eight years after promulgation of a M ACT standard, and nothing more. Courts have \nagreed with this reading of the Clean Air Act and  have found that the focus of the section 112(d)(6) periodic review \nis on new developments in pollution control or prevention technologies since the prior promulgation. See, e.g ., Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n for Surface Finishing v. EPA , 795 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that section 112(d)(6) provides for a \n\u201crecurring technology review\u201d to determine \u201cwhether standards should be tightened in view of developments in \ntechnologies and practices since the standard\u2019s promulgation or las t revision, and, in particular, the cost and \nfeasibility of developments and corresponding emissions savings\u201d); Blue Ridge Env tl. Def.  League v. Pruitt , 261 F. \nSupp.3d 53, 56 (D.D.C. 2017) (\u201cSpecifically, the Amendments required the EPA to promulgate emission standards \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 9 1. EPA Should Consider Factors Including Cost  and Acceptable Risk  to \nDetermine that the Proposed Rule Is Not \u201c Necessary. \u201d \nNLA believes that, consistent with Clean Air Act Section 112(d) (2), 42 U.S.C. Section \n7412(d)(2) , EPA has substantial discretion to consider all relevant factors to determine whether \nstandards for unregulated HAPs are \u201cnecessary\u201d in an RTR rulemaking, including but not limited \nto: what proportion of the affected sources are actually known to emit the HAP; how close to a \ndetection limit the concentrations are; whether the concentrations are likely to be reduced \nsignificantly by imposing an additional technol ogy-based limitation; whether the technology that \nis in effect for HAPs already regulated will also control the \u201cmissing HAP\u201d; and how cost  \neffective additional controls would be (since s ection 112(d)(6) allows costs to be taken into \naccount).  \n The costs  of this rule are significant . EPA\u2019s own cost analysis states that this rule will \nimpose cost s on 34 major sources of  between $2.01 billion and $2.43 billion. This includes \ncapital costs of $1.04 billion in year one, plus an additional annual cost of $174 million \nthereafter . These impacts are monumental for an industry that the U.S. Geological Service \nestimates receives  $2.3 billion in annual revenues.  \n \nEPA says that this rule \u201cis expected to increase the price of lime and reduce lime \nproduction and consumption from baseline levels.\u201d EPA  states  that under the rule, the price of \nlime will increase by 5.9%,  domestic production is estimated to decline  by 1.5% , imports are \nestimated to increase by 12.3% , and exports are expected to decline  by 6.7% . NLA believes that \nthese impacts are understated, because lime plants will also need to allocate a significant portion \nof their own lime production for use in dry sorbent injection systems to control HCl emissions. Rather than causing a 1.5% reduction in lime produced, if the lime allocated for HCl control is counted in that figure , reductions  in lime production could be several times that amount \nnationwide. There is evidence in the record that lime plants may need to use as much as 8% of their own hydrated lime product to meet the HCl standard. See  Greer Lime Company Comments , \nFeb. 21, 2023, at p. 5. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0167. \n EPA attempts to justify these costs by asserting that:  \n \nThis industry is regulated by EPA because pollutants emitted from lime manufacturing facilities are considered to cause or contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health \u2026The proposed requirements are \nbeing considered to address unacceptable health risks linked to emissions from lime manufacturing facilities and to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health.  \n See Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) \nat p. 45.

See Surface Finishing, 795 \nF.3d at 8- 9; Ass\u2019n of Battery Recyclers  v. EPA , 716 F.3d 667,  673-74 (D.C. Cir. 2013) .  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 10  \nThese statement s are demonstrably false, and directly contradict EPA\u2019s own repeated \nfindings that emissions from the lime industry are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety. Lime industry emissions are not endangering public health, nor are those  emissions levels \ncausing unacceptable health risks to the public. EPA must acknowledge this error and correct it in the final rule.  \n \n The costs of the rule cited by EPA are understated because they analyze the pollutants \none at a time and do not consider the m as a group. For some pollutants, high temperatures are \nrequired to reduce emissions. For other pollutants, controls will not be effective above a certain \ntemperature range. Lime plants that need to control multiple pollutants will need to spend \nsignificant resources on both heating and cooling at the same operation. These costs are not \nadequately reflected in EPA \u2019s analysis.  \n \nThe benefits of the rule are minimal, and in fact  are so negligible that  EPA  does not even \nattempt to quantify them: \u201cThe EPA did not monetize  the benefits from the estimated emission \nreductions of HAP associated with this final action. The EPA currently does not have sufficient methods to monetize benefits associated with HAP, HAP reductions and risk reductions for this \nrulemaking.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 9,099 (Feb. 9, 2024).   \n In addition, 97.7%  of HAP emission reductions claimed by EPA  come from HCl controls \namounting to reductions of  884 tons per year  (out of 905 tons per year total for all four HAPs) . \nBut EPA  has already determined  that even with no HCl controls : \u201cThe results of the exposure \nassessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production \nfacilities are well below the health threshold value  *** Furthermore, no significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. \u201d 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. \n2002). That is why EPA  found, twice, that risks from lime manufacturing emissions are \n\u201cacceptable with an ample margin of safety ,\u201d and thus additional controls would not yield \nsignificant benefits .  \n Reductions of other HAPs are even less significant. EPA\u2019s own analysis demonstrates \nthat the Proposed Rule , if implemented, would decrease organic  HAPs by only 20 tons/year in \ntotal. M ercury w ould be reduced by only a fraction of a ton ( 0.32 tons/year ). Dioxins and f urans \nreductions are almost too small to measure at 0.000000047 tons/year. The HAP reductions are so small that EPA said that: \u201cthere is no value reported in this table for monetized benefits and the \nnet benefits of this rule are unclear.\u201d Although EPA claims that \u201cthe proposed changes will have \nbeneficial effects on air quality and public health for populations exposed to emissions from lime \nmanufacturing facilities,\u201d this claim of public health benefits is contradicted by EPA \u2019s own risk \nassessment which found that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety.  \n \n2. Because The Rule Will Cause More Environmental Harm than Benefit, It  \nIs Not \u201cNecessary ,\u201d And Lacks a Rational Basis  \n \nThe Proposed Rule  will, on a net basis, do more environmental harm than good. While \nthe rule may  result in some  minimal reduction in HAPs that EPA has already determined a re well \nwithin acceptable levels , the rule will c ause a significant and unnecessary:  (1) increase in \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 11 greenhouse gas emissions and other air emissions ; (2) wast e of lime products that could be used \nto address other environmental problems; (3) addition  of waste streams for landfills ; and (4) \nwaste of water and energy resources to run unnecessary pollution control devices.  \n \nTo meet the requirements of reducing organics emissions by as few as 20 tons per year, \nEPA predicts  that several lime plants will need to install expensive and unnecessary regenerative \nthermal oxidizers (RTOs) to control such emissions. RTOs run on natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, the combustion of which generates greenhouse gas es. The direct result of this new \nregulation will be that tens of thousands of tons of CO\n2 will be unnecessarily released into the \natmosphere, contributing to climate change. This is the equivalent of adding thousands of passenger vehicles on America\u2019s roads , but without any passengers. In addition, any natural gas \nunnecessarily consumed in this process would be another wasted resource that could have been \nused for another beneficial purpose such as heating homes, producing cleaner electricity, or storage for future use.  In addition to carbon dioxide, combustion of fuel in RTO s will result in \nthe emission of other pollutants such as NOx and carbon monoxide. \nLime is a valuable resource that can be used for many environmentally beneficial \npurposes. But EPA\u2019s rule would force lime companies to use significant amounts of their own \nproduct to reduce HCl emissions that EPA  has twice found to pose acceptable risk with an ample \nmargin of safety. Dry sorbent injection requires lime to reduce HCl emissions. Instead of using \nthat lime for unneeded HCl emissions  reductions, that same lime could be used to make other \nmuch more significant environmental improvements. For example, two  tons of lime used for flue \ngas desulfurization could reduce SO 2 emissions by one ton. SO 2 is a criteria air pollutant, and \nEPA describes its effects as follows : \nShort-term exposures to SO 2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing \ndifficult. People with asthma, particularly children, are sensitive to these effects of SO 2. \nSO 2 emissions that lead to high concentrations of SO 2 in the air generally also lead to the \nformation of other sulfur oxides (SO x). SO x can react with other compounds in the \natmosphere to form small particles. These particles contribute to particulate matter (PM) \npollution. Small particles  may penetrate deeply into the lungs and in sufficient quantity \ncan contribute to health problems. \n \nSulfur Dioxide Basics | Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Pollution | US EPA \n \nLime is also  used by municipal and other water treatment plants across the United States \nto treat drinking water for the public. In this context, one ton of lime can soften over 450,000 gallons of drinking water. Likewise, lime is  instrumental in treating acid mine drainage f rom \nhistoric mining operations. Lime  neutralizes toxic acid mine drainage by raising its pH levels . \nUsed in this context, one ton of lime can treat  over 5 million gallons of water that will ultimately \nbe discharged into streams and other water bodies.  \n Imposing unnecessary regulations that  waste valuable lime resources in this way will \nhave unintended and detrimental environmental and economic consequences. These include making lime less available in the supply chain for environmentally beneficial uses, increasing the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 12 cost of lime for all users, and causing more lime to be produced than is currently necessary . \nIncreasing lime production will result in an  inefficient use of finite natural resources , including \nwasting limestone quarries  and the fuel used to produce the lime, as well as even more increased \nand unnecessary air emissions.  \n \nEPA\u2019s rule requiring reductions of HAPs by using activated carbon injection (ACI) will \npotentially create a significant new waste stream that will need to be landfilled in the environment. A lime plant that must install ACI may produce tons of additional waste annually. EPA policy should be to minimize waste streams into the environment --not to increase them , \nparticularly where EPA  has already determined that existing air emissions from lime plants are \ncurrently acceptable with an ample margin of safety, even without new standards.  \n Finally, EPA\u2019s own analysis acknowledges  that the imposition of new emissions \nstandards will result in secondary impacts from  projected  controls required for compliance with \nthe proposed standards. EPA expects lime plants to use 1.12 million additional gallons of water per year to address HCl controls with wet packed tower gas absorbers (WPTGAs) . EPA  predicts \nthat s olid waste from WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection, and A ctivated Carbon I njection will \nincrease solid waste by 13,400 tons per year. And finally, EP A states that all types of pollution \ncontrols installed under this rule (including WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers; Activated Carbon Injection; and Heat Exchangers) will collectively use an \nadditional 696 billion  Btu\u2019s of energy annually. According to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s \nEnergy Information Agency, the average ton of coal in the U.S. contains about 20.1 million Btus of energy. This means it would take over 34,000 tons of coal annually to produce that many Btus of energy. See EIA Frequently Asked Questions\n. \n The rule will reduce HAP emissions slightly, but in quantities so small that EPA  was \nunable to quantify the benefits of such reductions. In addition, EPA\u2019s own best available science shows that HAPs do not need to be further reduced to protect public health and the environment. But the rule will also lead inevitably to significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions, wasting of valuable lime products that could be better used to solve other environmental challenges, wasting of water and energy resources, and a significant and unnecessary increase in solid waste streams.  For all these reasons, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule is unnecessary and lacks a \nrational  basis  because it will cause more environmental harm than good, andany interpretation of \nthe statute that suggests that EPA is required to promulgate a regulation that causes more environmental harm than benefit also lacks a rational basis . Promulgating the rule as proposed, \nwithout adequately considering costs and environmental impacts, would be arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n3. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because Its Benefits Are De \nMinimis  \n LEAN did not overrule the seminal D.C. Circuit decision of Alabama Power v. Costle , \n636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1979), which held, in the context of the Clean Air Act\u2019s PSD regulations, that every rule  inherently contains a de minimis criterion. So, if regulation of \nadditional HAPs in this potential revised lime RTR proceeding would only have de minimis environmental benefits given the lack of residual risk or technology improvements, it is not \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 13 necessary for EPA to impose additional controls  to \u201caddress\u201d such HAPs. Although EPA has \ntaken the position that section 112(d)(6) does not allow for a de minimis exception7, the U.S. \nSupreme Court has held that the de minimis  doctrine is a legal principle that forms part of the \nestablished background against which all statutes  are enacted. Wisc. Dep\u2019t of Rev. v. William \nWrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992), and this has been subsequently reiterated by the \nD.C. Circuit. New York v. EPA , 443 F.3d 880, 888 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201c de minimis  requirements \nserve to alleviate severe administrative and economic burdens by lifting requirements on \n\u2018minuscule \u2019 emission increases \u201d) (internal quotations omitted).  In this case the benefits of the \nrule as proposed are truly de minimis , as compared to the negative environmental impacts and the \neconomic costs, an d the standards  set are extremely low (in several cases based on levels of non -\ndetection) . EPA should decline to impose these requirements.   \n \n4. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because the HAPs in the Rule \nWere Addressed in the 2004 Rulemaking  \n Another reason that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set standards for additional HAPs \nthrough the rulemaking here is because, as noted above, all the relevant HAPs were addressed in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and EPA expressed clear reasons for its decision not to set standards for them, reasons that went unchallenged. In this case, it is not necessary to \u201cfix\u201d any problem with the original MACT rule, because there is no such problem. This is further confirmed by the conclusion of EPA\u2019s risk assessment, whi ch addressed all these HAPs and \nfound no need to impose additional standards on any of them. \n Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 by adding sections  112(d)(2) and (d)(3) \nwhich require EPA to establish MACT floor standards for existing sources based on the average of the best performing 12% of each industry sector. Congress took this step because it believed that EPA  was too slow in assessing risks and adopting air emissionstandards.. But unlike the \nsituation where risks from industry emissions are unknown, in this case there are two risk assessments and EPA  findings that emissions from the lime industry are acceptable with an \nample margin of safety. Under such circumstances, it is not only \u201cunnecessary\u201d for EPA to issue \nMACT floor standards, but irrational and contrary to the intent of the Act. Issuing standards that \nEPA  knows to be unnecessary to protect the public health and the environment is arbitrary and \ncapricious and cannot be c onsistent with what Congress intended in the Clean Air Act.  \n \nCongress clearly expressed its view in Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(f)(2) that additional \nregulation in the absence of risk is unnecessary. That section addresses the situation where risks are known (as in this rulemaking) following an appropriate scientific risk assessment by EPA. It \ninstructs EPA  to promulgate additional standards only if required to provide an ample margin of \nsafety to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect : \n *** the Administrator shall, within 8 years after promulgation of s tandards for each \ncategory or subcategory of sources pursuant to subsection (d), promulgate standards for \nsuch category or subc ategory if promulgation of such standards is required in order to \nprovide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section  \n \n7 See e.g. , EPA Response to Comments for Portland Cement Industry NESHAP, 64 Fed. Reg. 31898, 31911 (June \n14, 1999).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 14 *** or to prevent , taking into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant \nfactors, an adverse environmental effect.  \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(f)(2).  \n \nYet EPA found as recently as 2020 that risks  from emissions of the lime manufacturing \nindustry are acceptable with an ample margin of safety : \n In this action, we are finalizing our proposed determination that risks from the source \ncategory are acceptable, the standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth, and more stringent standards are not necessary to prevent an adverse environmental effect.  \n 85 Fed. Reg. 44,963 (July 24, 2020).  \n \nAccordingly, since EPA\u2019s own scientific findings demonstrate that promulgating new \nstandards is not \u201crequired\u201d to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health, there is \nno statutory requirement for EPA to revise the lime manufacturing sector\u2019s MACT standards  by \nadding these  four additional HAPs.  This view is also shared by many Members of Congress, \nincluding several  on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who stated that:  \n \nSince EPA has already found that such standards are not required to provide an ample \nmargin of safety, new regulations are not \u201cnecessary.\u201d EPA should withdraw the \nproposed rule and reiterate that new regulations are not necessary in this instance to \ncomply with the LEAN v. EPA decision and \u00a7112 of the Clean Air Act. \n Congressional Letter to EPA Administrator Regan, Dec. 8, 2023, at pp. 2 -3. \n \nFinally, the LEAN decision must be read in the context of the Supreme Court \u2019s recent \nopinion in West Virginia v EPA , which was decided post -LEAN . In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that for \u201cmajor questions\u201d \u2013 like the scope of EPA\u2019s authority to issue greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants under s ection 111(d) of the Clean Air Act \u2013 EPA must \ndemonstrate that Congress gave it specific authority for its regulatory action. West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022) . Surely, the question of w hether EPA can reach back decades in an \nRTR proceeding ( under s ections 112(f) and 112(d)(6) ) and  find that a provision of the Clean Air \nAct that was designed to require review for technological advances somehow compels EPA to reopen a MACT standard (issued under s ections 112(d)(2) and (3)) is a major one. Congress did \nnot give EPA that authority. Accordingly, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  is unlawful. \n II. EPA COULD NOT LEGALLY ESTABLISH MACT FLOORS FOR ANY OF THE \nPOLLUTANTS ADDRESSED IN THIS RULEMAKING  \n \nEPA states that: \u201cThese MACT standards are based on emissions levels that are already \nbeing achieved by the best -controlled and lowest -emitting sources in an industry.\u201d Regulatory \nImpact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emissions \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 15 Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) at p. 46. \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0208. \n \nTo the contrary, none  of the sources in the lime industry are controlled for these HAPs, \nand therefore none of them can fairly be considered the \u201cbest controlled.\u201d The sources cited by \nEPA are the \u201clowest emitting sources .\u201d But the Clean Air Act does  not say \u201clowest emittin g;\u201d \ninstead it says \u201cbest perform ing.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A). As noted above, NLA does not \nbelieve that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set any new emissions standards for the lime industry in \nthis rulemaking. However, if EPA decides  to set standards for additional HAPs, NLA believes \nthat EPA may not establish MACT floors for  HAPs when there are no current controls in place at \nany source. Rather, EPA must consider costs and other factors in setting standards.  \n \nNo lime plants currently use any add- on control technology to control emissions of any of \nthe four HAPs involved in this rulemaking. Differences in emissions are not the result of \ncontrols, but rather result from differences in feedstocks (stone and fuel), and operation of lime plant equipment. NLA believes that it is anomalous, and contrary to what was intended when the Clean Air Act air toxics provisions were written, to suggest that a source with lower \nconcentrations of a HAP in stone in its quarry (for e xample) is somehow the \u201cbest performer\u201d in \nterms of controlling emissions of that HAP. Thus, NLA believes that it is improper to set a \nMACT floor based on such emissions data. NLA is aware that EPA takes a contrary view, but the facts of this case\u2014in which stringent standards are being imposed even with a finding of acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety for HAPs that are not being controlled by any source \u2014justify a reconsideration of EPA\u2019s position.  \n Instead of setting MACT floors, EPA should have approached all four HAPs using the \nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(d)(2), which provides:  \n \nEmissions standards promulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or existing \nsources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the maximum degree of reduction in \nemissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to this section (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non- air quality health and \nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable for new  or \nexisting sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies \u2026 \n NLA does not believe that this point is inconsistent with  National Lime Ass'n v. E.P.A , \n233 F.3d 625 (D.C. Cir. 2000) , or Sierra Club v. E.P.A ., 479 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 2007) . In those \ncases, EPA set a \u201cfloor\u201d of no control where no technology controls were in place. The court held that the statu te requires an emissions standard for each HAP, even where no technology \ncontrols are in place. However, in neither case did the court rule that EPA must set a MACT \nfloor to  set the standard, nor did it give guidanc e to EPA on how to do so. In Sierra Club v. EPA , \nNo. 15- 1487 (D.C. Cir. July 6, 2018) , industry petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rule would require \nraw material substitution . The Court noted again that the statute requires standards for all HAPs, \neven if emissions differences are due to differences in feedstocks, but goes on to state that it was \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 16 not necessary to rule on those grounds, because EPA\u2019s standard did not require raw material \nsubstitution in the first place.  \n NLA believes that EPA should consider the \u201c cost of achieving such emission reduction, \nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements \u201d in setting \nstandards when  there are no technology controls in place. Indeed, the concept of the MACT floor \nis that a percentage of the source category can  achieve a certain  level of control , typically with \nthe use of already -installed air pollution control technology. This is why the statu te refers to such \nsources as \u201cbest performers.\u201d The id ea was that it was fair to require additional sources to apply \nthe same controls as the \u201cbest performers\u201d  because the \u201cbest performers\u201d were presumably able \nto bear the costs of those controls. Differences in the makeup of onsite quarries is not \u201cperformance,\u201d it is  pure chance .  \n As explained above, the costs of the Proposed Rule are extremely high, and the \nenvironmental benefits are extremely low, and even negative when energy use , additional carbon \ndioxide emissions, and generation of additional wastes are considered . EPA should withdraw the \nProposed Rule and abandon its MACT floor approach to the lime industry, and instead should set standards that are protective of human health and the environment, without imposing unnecessary costs on the lime industry, including its small businesses.  \n \nIII. EPA \u2019S PROPOSED RULE VIOLATES CLEAN AIR ACT  SECTION 307 \n A. EPA Violated the Clean Air Act by Not Publishing the Proposed Rule Language in the Federal Register  \n EPA proposed this rule\u2014as it also did with the January 2023 Proposed Rule\u2014without \npublishing any proposed rule language in the Federal Register . Rather than  setting forth \nproposed language, EPA instead included a redline version of the current regulations in the docket, to indicate  what the proposed revisions would be. This docket entry is not a lawful \nsubstitute for publishing actual rule language \u2013 it is a rule that the lime industry must comply \nwith, not the preamble, and not a document tucked away in the record for the rulemaking. Failing to publish such language means that commenters do not have a meaningful opportunity to submit comments on the Proposed Rule. Failure to publish the rule language in the Federal Register  also \nviolates s ection 307(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act which requires:  \n \n\u2026any rule to which this subsection applies, notice of proposed rulemaking shall be \npublished in the Federal Register\u2026 \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3). \n \nWhen proposing a rule, EPA must properly publish proposed rule language in the \nFederal Register . The comment period for a Proposed Rule cannot begin until the actual  \nproposed rule language is published in the Federal Re gister . \n  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 17 B. EPA Violated the Statement of Basis and Purpose Requirement by Failing to \nInclude a Summary of the Major Legal Interpretations and Policy \nConsiderations Underlying the Proposed Rule   \n \nThe 2024 Proposed Rule reverses important determinations made in the original lime \nMACT standard issued in 2004 without mention, comment,  or explanation by EPA . Although it \nsolicits comment on the concept of adopting a health- based emission limit (HBEL) for HCl, it \nstill proposes to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl  without providing details and an \nexplanation of why EPA  is reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nand that a health -based  standard is appropriate, and that no HCl standard is needed at all . This is \na reversal of EPA\u2019s longstanding twenty -year finding established in the 2004 MACT standard \nand was not addressed in either the 2023 or the 2024 Proposed Rule s.8  \n \nIn the preamble of the 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA states that: \u201c In response to the 2017 \nquestionnaire, we received HCL emissions data that EPA did not have when we developed the 2004 NESHAP. Therefore, we are proposing a standard pursuant to CAA section 112(d) (2) and \n(d)(3), as described further in section IV.A.1 of this preamble.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 809. While these two sentences are each factually true, taken together without explanation, the y are misleading . \nThat is because they  imply cause and effect \u2014i.e. , that the reason EPA  is now promulgating \nMACT floor standards for HCl is because it obtained new emissions  information that justified \nsuch regulation that was  not avai lable in 2004. This is simply not the case. EPA had ample HCl \ninformation for its initial MACT rulemaking when it determined that: \n The results of the exposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production facilities are well below the health threshold value. Additionally, the threshold values, for which the RfC and AEGL values were determined to be appropriate values, were not exceeded when considering conservative estimates of \nexposure resulting from lime kiln emissions as well as considering background exposures to HCl and therefore, represent an ample margin of safety. Furthermore, no signific ant or \nwidespread adverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. Therefore, under \nauthority of section 112(d)(4), we have determined that further control of HCl emissions from lime manufacturing plants is not necessary.  \n 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. 2002).  \n \nEPA has not identified any new data from the 2017 ICR that is so fundamentally different \nto justify  regulation of HCl from lime manufacturing plants. T o the contrary, EPA  affirmed the \nacceptability of risks from all HAPs, including HCl, as recently as 2020 and found, in fact, that \nrisks are much lower than it originally believed. 85 Fed.

All \nthe data from the 2017 questionnaire on HCl was available to EPA when it performed the risk assessment that it used as the basis for its  2020 determination that risks are acceptable and that \nthe existing regulations provide an ample margin of safety.  \n \n8 See 69 Fed.

EPA SHOULD AUTHORIZE PLANT -WIDE EMISSIONS AVERAGING FOR \nALL HAPS COVERED BY THE RULE , INCLUDING O RGANIC HAPS  AND \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nIn its comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, NLA request ed that emissions \naveraging be incorporated into a final rule  for the newly regulated HAPs , to allow  lime plants to \nmore cost -effectively optimize controls to prevent excessive emissions across the entire fa cility.  \nNLA noted that in the 2004 Lime MACT, EPA permitted plant -wide averaging of PM emissions \n(with some limitations), explaining: \n \nWe believe that allowing averaging is appropriate here because of the identity of the units \n(kilns and coolers in all cases), and the emissions (same HAP in same type of emissions, since all emissions result from kilns and coolers). Averaged emissions unde r these \ncircumstances would, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source. The averaging \nprovisions are included in the final NESHAP as a result of the recommendations of the \nSmall Business Advocacy Panel convened as required by section 609(b) of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and improves the compliance flexibility options for \nsmall businesses, which is the intent of the RFA.  \n 69 Fed. R eg. 401 ( Jan. 5, 2004) .  \n \nIn the 20 24 Proposed Rule, EPA has proposed to allow emissions averaging for HCl and \nmercury emissions, with some restrictions. NLA commends EPA for including this approach but  \nbelieves that the same logic supporting emissions averaging for HCl and Hg supports emissions \naveraging for all covered HAPs . \n \nFor HCl and mercury, with limitations based on  pounds of H AP per ton or million ( MM)  \nton of lime produced, and for lime kilns seeking to comply with the same numerical standard, \nNLA agrees that EPA should authorize the weighted average methodology currently available \nfor PM in the current Lime MACT ( 40 C.F.R.\u00a7 63.7111) to show compliance. As explained \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 19 further below, NLA believes EPA should also authorize emissions averaging for organic HAPs \nand for dioxins and furans.9 \n \nA. EPA  Should Not Impose a Penalty on Emissions Averaging \nEPA  should delete the provision that  penalizes  emissions averaging by imposing a more \nstringent standard on averaged emissions.  This provision is arbitrary and unsupported by the \nfacts . As noted repeatedly, EPA has found that risks are already acceptable with an ample margin \nof safety for all HAPs with no additional standards at all. Accordingly, there are no benefits to \npublic health or the environment commensurate with any additional costs or controls that would be incurred to meet the emissions averaging  \u201cpenalty.\u201d EPA should delete this requirement and \ncall for averaged emissions to meet the same standard (on average) as un -averaged emissions. As \nEPA said with respect to PM as noted above, \u201c Averaged emissions under these circumstances \nwould, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source.\u201d Averaging should be encouraged, not \ndiscouraged, because it allows sources to use the most efficient methods available to meet the standards.  \n Simple mathematics prove s that incorporation of the proposed 10% penalty for those \nsources utilizing emissions averaging will be more restrictive than existing sources meeting the already proposed restrictive MACT floors for HCl and Hg at the unit level. Use of the emissions \naveraging alternative not only requires at least one kiln to operate below these new aggressive \nMACT floors, it then requires the unit to operate at an even more restrictive level for the averaging to be useful.  In other words, the inc orporation of a penalty for emissions averaging \nruns contrary to providing EPA\u2019s express purpose of providing additional compliance flexibility.\n10 \n EPA presumes that this option will provide reductions at lower cost on a unit -by-unit \nbasis.  Even if there will be some cost savings, this does not justify the imposition of a penalty for \naveraging. Operators may choose to average emissions for reasons that are not purely economic .  \nFor example, there can be operational or site constraint reasons that will prompt an operator to \nchoose averaging that are independent of cost.   \n As mentioned in these comments  and in prior submittals, there are still fundamental \ntechnical issues to be overcome for candidate controls to meet EPA\u2019s proposed aggressive standards before any arbitrary penalty is applied. As a result, EPA\u2019s proposal  for an averaging \npenalty  is essentially adding unsupported beyond- the-floor requirements . As has been pointed \nout repeatedly, the proposed limits already provide an ample margin of safety,  and no cost -\neffective beyond- the-floor controls are available. Thus, there is no environmental impact  being \nmitigated through an arbitrary penalty for those utilizing the emissions averaging option to demonstrate compliance . \n \n9 Accompanying these comments as Appendix A  is a \u201cblueline\u201d of the regulatory language that EPA included as a \nredline in the rulemaking docket. In this Appendix, NLA indicates suggested changes to the regulatory language \nreflect ing these comments.  EPA\u2019s changes remain in red, while the suggested NLA changes are in blue.  \n10 See 89 Fed. Reg. 28 9097.  \u201c We are proposing the emissions averaging compliance alternative for  \nexisting sources because we expect that it will result in a greater level of emissions reduction than the unit -by-unit \nMACT floor limits at a lower cost per pound of pollutant removed, while also providing compliance flexibility.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 20  \nTherefore, EPA should not incorporate any penalty on the emissions limits for those \nchoosing emissions averaging under this rulemaking. Furthermore, the Lime MACT already \nincludes emissions averaging for PM which has worked well for over 20 years, and no such penalty was applied.  \n \nB. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging for Organics and Dioxins and \nFurans  \nEPA should allow for emissions averaging for organics and for dioxins and furans. The \nstandards  for these two categories of HAPs  are extremely  low ( in the parts -per-million or parts -\nper-billion ), and whether such pollutants are detected in a stack test are often dependent on \nrandom chance-- whether such molecules happen to strike the probe during that test. Members \nhave reported to NLA that similar kilns of the same  size and  type, using the same limestone \nfeedstock and the same fuel, often have significantly  different oHAP or D/F test results  even for \nidentical kilns . Allowing averaging of these two categories of pollutants would help to alleviate \nthis issue and provide compliance flexibility to sources , and because EPA has found that lime \nindustry emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safely even in the absence of controls, \nno harm to human health and the environment would result from allowing such averaging.  \n While the limits for organics and D/F are concentration- based (as opposed to being based \non production rates as with HCl and mercury), there is no technical or legal obstacle to the \ndevelopment of appropriate emissions a veraging for these HAPs as well  (and they should be \ndeveloped without a penalty , as explained above ). \n \nA simple and appropriate approach for these HAPs would include  the following \nrequirements and methodology, and should be added to \u00a763.7112 (see NLA \u201cblueline, \u201d \nAppendix A ): \n \n\u2022 Step 1:  Complete performance tests and collect oHAP and D/F data in the units of the \nemissions limitations, respectively.  The measurement units are parts  per million, dry \nbasis and by volume (ppmdv) for oHAP and nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (ng/dscm) for D/F, both corrected to 7% O\n2 in the exhaust gas stream. \n\u2022 Step 2:  Based on the average flowrate for each kiln and lime cooler from the performance test, compute a flowrate weighted emissions average for comparison to the applicable limitation.  \n \nThe following is an illustration of how this would work in practice on a two - kiln emissions \naverage:  \n \n\u2022 Kiln 1  \no C\nK1 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.05 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK1 = Measured airflow = 25,000 dscm in this example  \n\u2022 Kiln 2   \no CK2 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.02 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK2 = Measured airflow = 50,000 dscm in this example  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 21 \u2022 Emissions Averaging Calculation:  \no Eavg = (C K1 x F K1)/(F K1 + F K2)+ (C K2 x F K2)/(F K1 + F K2) \no Eavg = (0.05 x 25,000)/(25,000+50,000)+ (0.02 x 50,000/(25,000+50,000)  \no Eavg = 0.03 ng/dscm which is less than the proposed limit of 0.037 ng/dscm  \n \nIn terms of necessary recordkeeping and reporting for the emissions average, like HCl \nand Hg, an annual average recordkeeping should be incorporated when this compliance \nalternative is utilized. In place of tons of lime produced, the rule should provide that lime operators can either: 1) record total kiln gas flowrate from each unit in the average during each calendar month; or 2) develop a dscm/ton of stone feed from the performance test used in the emissions average and lime produced each month to  demonst rate compliance with the emissions \naverages for these two pollutants.\n11 Suggested rule language is below:  \n \nThe emissions average for total organic HAP or D/F shall be computed as follows:  \n \n(a) The concentration of total organic HAP or  dioxins/furans shall be correct to 7 percent \noxygen using equation 5 of this section for lime kilns included in the emissions average.  \n(b) From the respective performance tests, obtain the flowrate in units of dscm for each kiln in the average.  \n(c) Using the following equation, Equation [X], compute the emissions average concentration for comparison to the emissions limitation:  \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 =\ufffd (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u2217\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36)/(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39)\n\u221e\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b=1  \n \n\u2022 Eavg = Emission average in units of D/F in ng/dscm, 7% O 2 or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% \nO2 \n\u2022 CKi = Measured concentration for D/F in ng/dscm or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% O 2 for a \nlime kiln  \n\u2022 FKi = Measured exhaust gas in units of dscm for a lime kiln \n\u2022 FKt = Total combined measured airflow in units of dscm for all lime kilns in the \nemissions average  \n \n \nC. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging Between New and Existing Kilns  \nFor particulate matter (PM), EPA allow s lime plants to average emissions between new \nand existing kilns, as explained below  in the Proposed Rule preamble : \n \nIf the lime manufacturing plant has both new and existing kilns and coolers, then   \nthe emission limit would be an average of the existing and new kiln PM emissions \nlimits, weighted by the annual actual production rates of the individual kilns, except that no new kiln may exceed the PM emission level of 0.10 lb/tsf. \n \n11 Given that lime kiln and cooler exhaust gas flows are proportional to decarbonization of limestone (and related \nfuel combustion to support calcination), lime production and exhaust gas flows are proportional by nature.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 22  \n89 Fed. Reg. 9090.  \n \nThe Proposed Rule does not permit averaging between new and existing kilns for HCl \nand mercury, even for kilns of the same type. EPA should allow such averaging for all HAPs , as \nit did for PM, so long as the new kiln does not exceed the new kiln standard. \n \nD. EPA  Should Not Require a Separate Emissions Averaging Plan  or Pre-\nApproval for Emission Averaging \nEPA\u2019s new proposal includes a requirement that sources using the option for emissions \naveraging to prepare and submit an emissions  averaging plan for approval before emissions \naveraging can begin. 12 This requirement is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. L ime \nproducers subject to this rule are already required to prepare an OM&M Plan and various \nperformance test protocol and notification documents as part of this regulation.  With this variety \nof administrative documents in place, EPA should simply allow li me producers to document the \nemissions averaging plan requirements in their OM&M Plan , without preparing a separate plan, \nand without submitting it for pre -approval. Inclusion of a pre -approval process injects a level of \ncomplexity and need for official action that is excessive, given the fact that emissions from the industry are already so low that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety without any new standards.  \n E. EPA Should Allow for Averaging Across HCl Subcategories, Including \nPlant -Wide Averaging \nAs previously discussed, a regulatory option that allow s emissions averaging provides \ncompliance flexibility for those sources  that opt to use averaging . However, this option can be \nfurther enhanced by allowing existing kilns, regardless of their subcategories, to be averaged \nacross a single plant. This would only apply to HCl, because EPA has only proposed \nsubcategories for HCl. It would also be unnecessary if EPA establishes a health -based emission \nlimit (HBEL) for HCl.  \n If EPA continues to set subcategories for HCl, NLA suggests that the final rule include a \nplant -wide, all kiln, averaging alternative. This regulatory approach can be accomplished by \nestablishing a site -wide limit as follows:  \n Establish a sitewide allowable HCl emissions limit by the following steps:  \n \n1. Determine the annual production capacity of lime by subcategory type for the \nfacility.  \n2. Multiply the sitewide total production capacity by lime type times the respective \nsubcategory emissions limit.  \n3. The resulting value will establish the sitewide allowable HCl limitation in units of tons per year.  \n \n \n12 \u00a763.7114(c)(2) , Docket ID: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0200.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 23 Compliance with the annual HCl limit would be demonstrated by:  \n \n1. Multiplying the lime production for each month by lime type times the respective \nHCl limit (or most recent HCl performance test value as available) to compute the tons of HCl emitted during the month. \n2. Add this result to the prior 11 calendar month period to compute a 12- month total \nHCl actual emissions level which is then compared to the site -wide allowable HCl \nlimit.  \n \nThis form of a limitation is comparable in form to an  HBEL though it is more restrictive because \nthe sitewide HCl limit would be based on the facility\u2019s Potential to Emit ( PTE) HCl using the \nHCl limits in the Proposed Rule.\n13 \n \nV. EPA CORRECTLY PROPOSED TO SET MONITORING REQIREMENTS AS \nFIVE -YEAR STACK TESTING  AND PARAMETRIC MONITORING  \n NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s proposal to establish 5- year stack testing and parametric \nmonitoring as the monitoring requirements for emissions standards under the Proposed Rule.\n14 \nThis is consistent with the existing requirements for PM for the lime industry , and, as EPA notes, \nthe parametric monitoring will ensure continuous compliance. Imposing more rigorous and costly monitoring requirements would not be justified in this case, given the low emissions of HAPs generally, and EPA\u2019s risk assessment showing that risks are acceptable with an ample \nmargin of safety even without additional controls. \n \nVI. NLA SUPPORTS EPA\u2019s  PROPOSED 3- YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD, BUT \nEPA  SHOULD EXERCISE ITS AUTHORI TY TO ALLOW  AN ADDIT IONAL \nYEAR THROUGH PERMITTING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF NEW CONTROLS   \n Given the extensive requirements for study, design, permitting and construction that lime \nplants would be subject to under the Proposed Rule, the need for a 3-year compliance period is fully justified to adequately test, engineer, design, and retrofit  lime plant systems,  and then \ndemonstrate compliance with the applicable standards . Any period less than 3 years would \njeopardize the industry\u2019s ability  to comply with the proposed standard. \n In addition, EPA should state  in the preamble to the final rule that it encourages s tate \npermitting authorities (or EPA if it is  the regulatory authority) to allow lime manufacturing \nplants an additional year to install new controls for this rule . The statute expressly allows  this \noption under these circumstances : \n The Administrator  (or a  State  \nwith a program approved under subchapter V) may issue a \npermit that grants an extension permitting an existing source  up to 1 additional year to \ncomply with standards under subsection (d) if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls.   \n \n13 This suggested rule language is not included in the NLA blueline, which rather reflects an HBEL for HCl.  \n14 NLA suggests some adjustments to the parametric monitoring requirements later in these comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 24 42 USC \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(B).  \n \nProviding an additional year through permitting will be necessary  given that the entire \nlime industry will be installing new controls simultaneously and will face difficulties with \nensuring that a limited number of vendors are able to install controls on dozens of lime kilns across the nation, particularly given recent supply chain shortages and issues. Also, given EPA\u2019s \ndetermination that emissions from lime kilns are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety, allowing an extra year for installatio n of controls will not harm public health or the \nenvironment. \n \nVII. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THE USE OF \u201cNEW\u201d AND \u201cEXISTING\u201d KILNS  \n EPA should also clarify its use of \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d kilns in the Proposed Rule. The \ncurrent NESHAP rule defines a new lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one for which \nconstruction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002. It also defines an existing lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one that does not meet the definition of a new kiln.  \n \nIn the 2024 Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n The EPA is including definitions of the terms \u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 as \nrelated to the requirements of this supplemental proposal and to clearly indicate that a \n\u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 in reference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal i s any \napplicable source constructed after January 5, 2023, and an \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 in \nreference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal is any applicable source \nconstructed before January 5, 2023. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9097. NLA has identified two problems with this. First, there is no language in the docket redline with definitions as described in the paragraph above. (This emphasizes the importance of including proposed rule language in the Federal Register  notice itself.) \nAppropriate language must be added to the final rule.   Second, NLA does not agree that the relevant date for what constitutes an existing kiln  or \na new kiln should be January 5, 2023. The current February 9, 2024, Proposed Rule sets  new \nstandards for the first time for all four HAPs and  was carried out in response to the Small \nBusiness review panel described above. If the date for determining if a kiln is \u201cnew\u201d is to be \nbased on the proposed rule date, the relevant date should be February 9, 2024.  \n \nAccordingly, EPA should revise the Proposed Rule  language to read as follows (changes \nmarked in red) : \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 25 \u00a763.7082  What parts of  my plant  does this  subpart cover?  \n(a) This subpart  applies  to each existing  or new lime kiln(s)  and their associated  \ncooler(s), and processed stone handling (PSH) operations system(s) located at an LMP \nthat is a major source.  \n(b) A new lime kiln is a lime kiln, and (if applicable)  its associated  lime cooler,  for \nwhich construction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002, if you met the \napplicability criteria in \u00a763.7081 at the time you began construction or reconstruction, except that with respect to emissions standards added [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE], \na new lime kiln is a lime kiln for which construction or reconstruction began after  \nFebruary 9, 2024.  \n \n \n NLA believes that this change will make it appropriately clear that when \u201cnew\u201d \nand \u201cexisting\u201d are used elsewhere in the rule language, they refer either to the PM standards or to the additional standards being added in this rule. (Thus, for example, a kil n could be \n\u201cnew\u201d for purposes of PM, but \u201cexisting\u201d for purposes of the additional HAPs.)  \n  In addition, the word \u201cinitially\u201d should be added before the phrase \u201cstart up ,\u201d and \nthe word \u201cinitial\u201d should be added before the  word \u201cstartup ,\u201d in section s 63.7083(a)(1 ) and \n(2), 63.7083(c) , 63.7083(e)(1) , 63.7110(f) , and 63.7130(b)  and (c) , to make clear that the \nrequirements in those sections apply to initial startup, not to each time a kiln is started up. This will avoid confusion with other provisions relating to recurring periods of startup and shutdown. \n \nVIII.  THE RULE LANGUAGE ON COMPLIANCE PERIOD SHOULD BE CORRECTED  While EPA\u2019s preamble clearly states that a 3 -year compliance period is intended for \nexisting sources, language in Section  63.7083( h)(1) in the redline rule language in the docket \nseems to indicate that the compliance period is only 180 days. The preamble states:  \n For all affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction on or before January 5, 2023, we are proposing to require compliance with the proposed standards within 3 years after the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later). For all affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after  \nJanuary 5, 2023, we are proposing that owners or operators comply with the provisions \nby the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later).  \n 8 Fed. Reg. 9098. NLA understands \u201c affected sources that commence construction on or before \nJanuary 5, 2023\u201d to mean \u201cexisting sources\u201d with respect to the new standards proposed in this rule, and that these sources are intended to have three years from the date of the final rule to \ncome into compliance.   \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 26  However, the redline proposed regulatory language in the docket is inconsistent with the \npreamble language and refers to 180 days rather than 3 years. There is also a discrepancy \nbetween the preamble and the redline rule language on whether the relevant \u201co n or before date\u201d \nis Jan. 5, 2023, or the date of the final rule. NLA believes that EPA should refer to February 9, \n2024, rather than the 2023 date, because, as noted above, EPA has made significant substantive changes to the rule . Indeed, it is possible that a source could have begun and completed \nreconstruction of a kiln between January of 2023 and February of 2024, without knowing what \nthe relevant requirements would be. (Section 112(a)(2) precludes use of the final rule date for \ndefining new vs. existing kilns.)   \n New section 67.7083( h)(1) in the EPA redline document reads:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before  \n[INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], \nthen the compliance date for the revised requirements promulgated on [INSERT DATE \nOF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 180 \nDAYS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATI ON IN THE FEDERAL \nREGISTER].  \n \nThis language should be revised to read:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before \nFebruary 9, 2024, then the compliance date for the revised requirements \npromulgated on [INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE \nFEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 3 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL \nRULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\n  \n \nNote: EP A\u2019s proposed revisions to \u00a77083 means tha t numerous references to \u00a77083(e) in the rule \nlanguage will need to be changed to \u00a77083(g). See the NLA blueline for these changes.  \n IX. THE RULE SHOULD ONLY APPLY PM STANDARDS TO COOLERS  \nAs currently written, the Proposed Rule would apply standards for HAPs other than PM \nto kilns and \u201cassociated coolers.\u201d For the reasons below, this should be changed, and the rule should apply only PM standards to coolers. Definitional language should also be added to make this clear.  \n In a lime plant, limestone is calcined in a heated kiln, and it is the emissions  exiting in \nexhaust from the kiln that contain the HAPs  address ed in this regulation \u2014HCl, mercury, organic \nHAPs, and dioxins/and furans. When the lime product is made, it leaves the kiln and is transferred to a cooler, a large vessel in which the lime product is cooled by the introduction of ambient air (not gases from the kiln). Pulling in ambient air to the cooler by means of a fan may result in the presence of dust or particulate matter in the cooler exhaust. Th is is why  EPA \nestablished PM standards applicable to coolers in the original lime rule.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 27  \nThis distinction is not important when the air from the cooler vents to the same stack as \ngases from the kiln, because those kilns will have to meet all the HAP standards at the stack. However, in some cases cooler exhaust  vents separately and is sent to a separate stack from kiln \ngases . In those cases, it is only necessary to test for PM at those stacks , because the other HAPs \nwill not be present.  \n Furthermore, as explained in the separate comments filed by NLA members Lhoist, \napplying the oH AP standards to separately vented coolers would result in anomalous results. As \nLhoist (which operates such a cooler) explains: \n In addition, the methodology used to convert a pollutant to a standard O\n2 concentration is \nmeant to be utilized in combustion sources.  Applying this same methodology to a source that utilizes ambient O\n2 results in nonsensical emission rates.  For example, consider a \nsituation from a lime cooler, where no oHAP\u2019s were measured.  Per the proposed rule, the source must report the total oHAP emission rate using the method detection limit.  The following equation demonstrates how a non- detect measurement for oHA P in a lime \ncooler becomes a significant emission rate when converting this to a measurement at 7% O\n2.  \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  @ 7% \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422=\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u2212\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 2\ufffd where,  \n \nEoHAP @ 7% O2 = Total oHAP concentration in ppmvd @ 7% O 2 \nCoHAP = Total oHAP concentration at the measured oxygen concentration \nO2 = Measured oxygen concentration at the source \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u221220.85\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd13.9\n0.05\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 278 =155 .7 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d @ 7%  \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422 \n \nA total oHAP measurement that started as a non -detectable emission rate at an O 2 \nconcentration of 20.85% results in a reported total emission rate of 155.7 ppmvd @ 7% O\n2.  At this emission rate, an operator would be required to install an add-on pollution \ncontrol device (likely an RTO) for an emission rate that is nonexistent.    \n Under the rule as written, this absurd result would occur even if no oHAPs were detected at the cooler at all, because the rule requires use of the MDL when no oHAPs are detected. (This is another reason EPA should use 0 for non- detects) . \n \nNLA suggests that this issue be addressed by modifying the definition of \u201c Lime Cooler \u201d \nin \u00a763.7143 as follows: \n \nLime cooler means the device external to the lime kiln (or part of the lime kiln itself) used to \nreduce the temperature of the lime produced by the kiln. For the purposes of this regulation, a cooler is associated with a lime kiln with respect to particulate matter (PM) emissions, but is not associated with a lime kiln for the purposes of standards for additional air pollutants added \nto the regulation on [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE].  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 28  \nIn addition, references to coolers should be removed from \u00a763.7112(o), and Table 1, \nLines 13, 14, 15, and 16. In Table 4, Line 1, the term PM should be restored to the parenthetical, \nbecause only PM emissions from separate coolers need to be summed with kiln emissions.  X. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THAT NOT ALL PERFORMANCE TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED IN THE SAME SCHEDULE  \n \n As written, \u00a763.7112 could be read to require that performance tests for all HAPs, \nincluding PM, be performed at the same time. EPA should clarify that this is not required. \nSources may have undertaken PM performance tests less than 5 years before the issuance of the final rule governing additional HAPs, and thus testing for PM could be on a different 5-year schedule than testing for the additional HAPs. In addition, sources may for practical reasons perform testing of the additional HAPs on varying schedules (although, of course, they would all have to be performed within the required period). NLA suggests adding the following language to \u00a763.7112(b) to clarify this point:  \nPerformance tests for the emission standards promulgated in this rule, including PM \nemission standards and emissions standards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at \nthe same time . \n XI. EPA SHOULD EXPRESS STANDARDS IN TERMS OF \u201cLIME PRODUCED,\u201d NOT \u201cSTONE PRODUCED.\u201d  \n \nIn the definitions section of the Proposed Rule redline (\u00a763.7143) , EPA includes the \nfollowing:  \nStone produced refers to the production of limestone from the lime kiln consisting of high calcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nSubsequently, the term \u201cstone produced\u201d is used in several places in the rule language, while in other places (such as Tables 1 and 9), the term \u201clime produced\u201d is used. EPA should consistently use the term \u201clime produced\u201d to refer to quicklime and dolomitic lime produced in lime kilns. Limestone is the stone feedstock used to make lime (which is why some other standards a re \nbased on \u201cstone feed.\u201d) The lime products are not limestone, or stone at all. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of  calcium carbon ate and/or calcium -magnesium \ncarbonate, while lime is calcium oxide  or calcium -magnesium oxide, a different compound and \nstructure entirely .  \n \nUsing the term \u201cstone\u201d for this material is likely to create confusion.  Using the term \n\u201clime\u201d to refer to lime products will be consistent with industry practice, and with terminology used by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n15 Accordingly, the definition of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be \ndeleted  from \u00a763.7143, and replaced with: \n \n \n15 See, e.g., https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024- lime.pdf . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 29 Lime produced  refers to the production of lime products produced from the lime kiln \nconsisting of high calcium quicklime, dolomitic quicklime, and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nThe term \u201cstone produced\u201d should be replaced with \u2018lime produced\u201d where the term \nappears elsewhere in the rule language.  The term appears in \u00a7\u00a7 63.7114 (c)(2)(i), 63.7121(g)(3) , \nand 63.7143. The term also appears in several locations in the Proposed Rule preamble, \nincluding in Tables 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and in text. These are inconsistent with the tables in the redline (which properly refer to \u201clime produced\u201d). All instances of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be changed to \u201clime produced\u201d if the reference is to lime product produced at the kiln. (Note further that \u201cquicklime\u201d is typically spelled as a single word with no spaces .) \n XII. EPA PROPERLY DECLINES TO PROPOSE BEYOND- THE -FLOOR \nSTANDARDS FOR EMISSIONS IN THE PROPOSED RULE  \n \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA correctly proposes not to set beyond- the-floor standards \nfor any of the covered HAPs.\n16  \n \nEPA is obligated  to consider  costs with respect to beyond- the-floor controls, as it is \ndirected to do in Clean Air Act section 112(d). A vital element in the analysis of the cost-\neffectiveness of an emissions standard  is whether it will significantly reduce the risk imposed by \nthe emissions to be controlled. In the case at hand, as recounted elsewhere in these comments, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment on all major sources in the lime industry in the 2020 RTR proceeding and determined that risks are acceptable at all major sources with an ample margin of safety  for all affected HAPs  even with no additional controls for at all . \nAccordingly, it cannot be cost -effective to impose additional costs on any existing source \nbecause the lack of a health or environmental benefit does not justify any new costs.  \n Imposing beyond -the-floor standards would impose unnecessary additional costs on \nsources. To  comply with any emissions standard, sources must calibrate pollution control devices \nto achieve the standard, with an appropriate margin of error to prevent violations. For example, when the treatment technology EPA identifies for mercury control is activated carbon injection (ACI), the rate of injection \u2014and thus the cost of carbon\u2014will directly relate to the emissions \nstandard. A lower standard means more carbon injected, and higher costs. Furthermore, existing \nplant configurations  may not be able to accept higher rates of ACI due to operational constraints , \nfurther increasing costs . Similar additional costs would be incurred for other HAPs as well if \nlower standard s were set. These additional costs cannot be justified by any consideration of costs \ncompared to risks because EPA already determined that the risks do not justify any additional controls at all.  \n In sum, NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s decision  not to set beyond- the-floor standards in \nthe Proposed Rule . \n \n \n16 In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed to set beyond -the-floor emission standards for mercury \nemissions from existing sources for most lime plants, and for both existing and new sources for sources making \ndead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 30 ISSUES RELATING TO SPECIFIC STANDARDS  \n \nHCL  \n XIII.  EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL BY MEANS OF  A HEALTH -BASED \nSTANDARD IN THIS RULEMAKING UNDER CLEAN AIR ACT SECTION \n112(D)(4)  \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA has reaffirmed  \nthat HCl is a threshold pollutant, and that a health -based standard under Clean Air Act Section \n112(d)(1) would be justified for the lime industry. While EPA does not propose to set such a \nstandard, it spells out the justification for such a standard, indicates what the standard would be, \nand requests comment on setting such a standar d. Thus , EPA can choose to set a health -based \nstandard in the final rule, and it should do so, for the reasons set out below.  \n \nA. EPA C arefully E valuated the S cientific D ata and C oncluded that HCl Was a \nThreshold P ollutant in the Original L ime MACT S tandard in 2004 and T hat \nFinding Was, and I s, Correct  \n \n The Clean Air Act allows EPA to use a health threshold when issuing emission standards \nunder s ection 112(d) for pollutants for which a health threshold has been established. CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(d)(4). Such a health- based standard must include an \u201cample margin \nof safety.\u201d Id. In its 112(d) MACT standard for lime manufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl \nwas a threshold pollutant, considering several factors such as \u201cevidence and classification of \ncarcinogenic risk and evidence of non -carcinogenic effects.\u201d 67 Fed. Reg. at 78054- 55.17 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for human receptors. Id.  at 78055. To aid in its ana lysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performing its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest \npotential for risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed  NLA\u2019s assessment.  \n \nIt is helpful to put these low risks in perspective. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) is the ratio \nof exposure (or modeled concentration) to the health reference value or threshold level ( i.e., \nreference concentration ( RfC) or acute exposure guidance level ( AEGL) ). HQ values less than \n\u201c1\u201d indicate that exposures are below the health reference value or threshold level and are likely \nto be without appreciable risk of adverse effect in the exposed population. 67 Fed. Reg. 78,055-\n \n17 In the preamble to the proposed lime  MACT standard  in 2002 , EPA noted that  it had included a detailed \ndiscussion of factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold \npollutant  in its proposed rule titled:  National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants From Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-\nAlone Semichemical Pulp Mills . 63 Fed. Reg. 18, 766 (April 15, 1998).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 31 56 (Dec. 20, 2002). Based on a n HCl risk assessment of all lime kilns in the industry, EPA felt \nconfident that exposures to HCl emissions from lime manufacturing facilities are unlikely to ever \nexceed an HQ of 0.2. Id.  at 78,056. In other words, risks from HCl emissions from lime plants \nhave a more than adequate \u201cam ple margin of safety\u201d because they are expected  to be \nsignificantly  lower than  the level at which there would likely be no appreciable risk  (i.e., an HQ \nof 1.0) .  \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed  a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sourc es of HAP . The maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (HI) for the lime \nmanufacturing source category was  estimated by EPA to be only 0.04 based on actual emission \nof HCl, nickel compounds, and acrolein emitted f rom lime kiln and cooler exhaust , and 0.05 \nbased on allowable emissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, ac rolein, and formaldehyde \nemissions as primary risk drivers , 85 Fed. Reg. 44,964 (July 24, 2020). In other words, when \nEPA did its follow -up residual risk assessment  using representative data under actual and \nallowable emissions scenarios , it found that the chronic risks from all noncancer HAP (including, \nbut not limited to HCl) were much  lower than the risks estimated in 2002, and even  further from \nan HQ of 1.0. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining that risks from \nuncontrolled emissions of HCl are acceptable wit h an ample margin of safety.  \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d Id.  at 78057.  \n Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HC l emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id.  EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities were below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since pa ssed. See CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1\n), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607 (b)(1).  \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in this rulemaking proceeding.\n18 \n In its recent RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor \nto conduct  a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard (which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone a health -based standard) w ere \u201cacceptable\u201d and \nthat the \u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960. EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \u201cmaximum individual cancer risk . . . for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 million,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing \n \n18 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to a health- based standard \nunder 112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified. If EPA had set \na health -based standard\u2014e ven a very high one that all sources would have met \u2014there could be no claim now that \nEPA failed to adequately address HCl. For EPA to now set a non- health -based standard without explanation would \nbe arbitrary and capricious and contrary to its own prior decisions.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 32 source category were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Proposed Amendments to Air Toxics \nStandards for Lime Manufacturing Plants , June, 2020.19 As such, because EPA concluded that \nthere are no health or safety risks under the current lime NESHAP, if EPA issues any standard at all, it should issue a health -based standard for HCl, as it would more than adequately protect the \npublic and is based on the best available science.  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November 18, 2021, EPA \nissued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations industry. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication \nOperations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and \nFabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. 18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA specifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d 86 Fed. Reg. 64391-92.  \n \nSeveral other RTRs have confirmed that EPA\u2019s longstanding position is that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing and \nAsphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, 14535 \n(Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity  to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk assessment \u2026 indicate \nthere is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is not classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d). \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, for EPA to reverse its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry would be arbitrary and capricious. As explained below, the recent Sierra Club decision in the brick/clay MACT rule does not provide any such new information or law. As noted above, newer information (including the Ramboll report), only serves to strengthen the determination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA may not reverse its prior decision on this topic and should promulgate a health-based standard for HCl. \n B. EPA is N ot Constrained by the B rick/ Clay Sierra Club  MACT C ase because \nLime M anufacturing I s Clearly D istinguishable from T hat C ase in A ll Its \nKey Factual/T echnical/ Legal C onclusions  \n In 2018, the Sierra Club and others challenged EPA\u2019s use of a health- based standard for \nHCl in the MACT standard for the brick/clay industry. Sierra Club v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. \n2018). Although the court sided with the Sierra Club in the case, the court did not say that EPA cannot issue a health -based  standard for HCl. Rather t he court remanded  EPA\u2019s standard for \nfurther consideration based on the three reasons discussed below. Critically, given current knowledge on HCl and the facts in the lime industry, none of these reasons is either relevant today, or can be used to deny use of a health-based standard for HCl for the lime manufacturing RTR.   \n \n19 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 33 First, the court held that EPA had not met the s ection 112(d)(4) requirement that a health \nthreshold be \u201cestablished.\u201d Id. at 10 -11. EPA had reviewed toxicity assessments in several \ndatabases and opinions from scientific bodies and found that none classified HCl as carcinogenic \nor \u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic.\u201d Id. However, the court held that EPA had not provided a sufficient record to determine that there was no cancer risk. EPA, the court stated, noted that \u201clittle research\u201d had been conducted on carcinogenicity of HCl. Ultimately, the court \ncharacterized EPA as relying on the \u201clack of any significant studies.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \nTherefore, the court held that EPA acted unreasonably by concluding that it is \u201cestablished\u201d that \nHCl poses no cancer risk. Id.  \n The overwhelming scientific consensus regarding the non- carcinogenicity of HCl is \nwidely accepted and compels the conclusion that HCl does not cause cancer. To aid in \npromulgation of the revised RTR, NLA engaged toxicology experts from the firm Ramboll to \nprepare a report on the carcinogenicity of HCl, which NLA provided to EPA on June 29, 2021 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0073) . In contrast to the insufficient record that served as the basis \nfor the Sierra Club court\u2019s holding, Ramboll concluded that \u201cHCl has not  been identified as a \ncarcinogen, either by authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own search of the scientific literature, \ndespite its long history of use.\u201d Ramboll, \u201c Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Hydrochloric \nAcid (HCl) and HCl Mist ,\u201d (June 11, 2021) (\u201cRamboll Report\u201d). Ramboll stated:  \n \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and \nepidemiological studies in exposed workers. Several authoritative groups \n(including the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer [IARC], the Internation al Programme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the international Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development [OECD]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of these groups have concluded that \nHCl is a carcinogen. Oth er authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology \nProgram) have chosen not to evaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is unlikely based on its physical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association with cancer.  \n  \u2026 \nIn addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramboll did a \nseries of additional literature searches for any new studies which might \nindicate HCl is a carcinogen. We employed several search strategies to \nmake sure we uncovered any new scienti fic evidence that may not have \nbeen considered by previous assessments. Despite this broad search, we \nidentified only six additional publications. This newer evidence is \nconsistent with the earlier body of scientific evidence. In addition to direct \nstudies  of cancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence \nin the form of genotoxicity studies or potential to induce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 34 Ramboll Report, Executive Summary. These conclusions satisfy the requirements of the Sierra \nClub decision, and thus, for purposes of the lime manufacturing RTR revisions, HCl should be \nconsidered a health threshold pollutant.  \n  In response to the new Proposed Rule, a t NLA\u2019s request Ramboll has performed a further \nliterature review for any new studies relating to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl. (See \nSecond Ramboll Report, Appendix B  to these comments). Ramboll identified three additional \nrelevant studies, but analysis of those studies did not change Ramboll\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \nnot a human carcinogen. (See below for further discussion of the Second Ramboll Report)  \n \nThe second basis for the Sierra Club court\u2019s rejection of EPA\u2019s characterization of HCl \nas a threshold pollutant was the court\u2019s conclusion that EPA used only a single -low confidence, \nlow-quality risk assessment in its review, and that EPA did not use a more stringent California \nEPA (\u201cCalEPA \u201d) reference concentration for HCl that does not pose a health risk. 895 F.3d at \n12. This concern does not apply to the lime RTR. The lime RTR risk assessment performed by EPA included multiple, robust dose -response asse ssments, including CalEPA chronic and acute \ninhalation reference exposure levels (\u201cRELS\u201d) \n20 21 Even using the more conservative CalEPA \nRELs for HCl, t he EPA risk assessment found no unacceptable human health risk due to chronic \nor acute inhalation exposure.  \n Use of the CalEPA REL in the RTR risk assessment, combined with the Ramboll study, \ndemonstrate s that in utilizing a health -based threshold for HC l in the revised lime RTR, EPA \nwould not be relying on a \u201csingle low -confidence, low -quality\u201d risk assessment. Rather, EPA \nwill be relying on a risk assessment that includes multiple robust dose -response assessments.  \n Finally, the Sierra Club court concluded that EPA\u2019s brick/clay health- based assessment \nwas flawed because the court could not determine whether EPA provided any \u201cample margin of safety\u201d in the HCl health threshold as required by section 112(d)(4). Id.  at 13. This flaw in EPA\u2019s \nreasoning in the brick/clay context should be readily  addressed in this rulemaking  \u2013 EPA should \nbreak out specifically and set forth in precise terms its \u201cample margin of safety\u201d conclusions  \n(which it already made in the context of the risk assessment performed for the RTR) . \n \nC. EPA\u2019s New Proposed Rule Properly  Concludes that HCl is a Threshold \nPollutant  \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA seeks comment on potentially setting a health- based \nstandard for HCl. EPA makes several key statements that support moving to such a standard. \nFirst, EPA recognizes that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for a health-\nbased standard  (or as denoted  by EPA, a health- based emission limit or HBEL)  to be set. EPA \nstates in the preamble:  \n \n \n20 Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the Risk and Technology \nReview 2019 Proposed Rule , EPA 2019, May, p. 27.  \n21 CalEPA defines the REL as \u201cthe concentration level at or below which no health effects are anticipated in the \ngeneral human population.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 35 With regard to  carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that the science and \nmethods of cancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA \namendments were issued. The EPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold or threshold po llutants.  Linear non- threshold carcinogens can cause adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, at any level of exposure. In contrast, non- linear threshold \ncarcinogens may pose a cancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA section 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus \non a threshold, not cancer risk, we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9092 (footnotes omitted). This is an important point, although as set out above, \nEPA should properly find that HCl is not a carcinogen. \n \n EPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic, and that evidence \nshows that there is a health threshold for hyperplasia, which could theoretically lead to cancer. 89 Fed. Reg. 9092- 9093. EPA goes on to appropriately distinguish it s current findings from \nconcerns raised by the Court in Sierra Club.  \n \n Based on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health -based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows:  \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of 300 tpy, not to exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would expect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions \nfrom this source category, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain at \nlevels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a maximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety and whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9094.  \n  NLA strongly believes that such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety. \nNote that EPA has already performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and has (on multiple occasions) found that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin  of safety with no additional standards at all. Thus, the suggested HBEL will \nalso provide an ample margin of safety\u2014because one already exists.  The HBEL would guarantee \nthat HCl emissions would remain below any possible le vel of concern.  NLA does not believe \nthat other measures beyond those elsewhere in the Proposed Rule would be necessary to support \nthe standard. (See discussion below of rule language changes that would be needed to implement \nthe HBEL.)  \n  In its Second Report (Appendix B ), Ramboll reviewed EPA\u2019s methodology and \nconclusions, and confirmed that EPA was correct in its evaluation of the potential risks of HCl, \nincluding EPA\u2019s findings on carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and other health effects. One point \nemphasized by Ramboll is that if HCl were a human carcinogen, it would be expected that evidence of its carcinogenicity would have emerged, given the extensive u se of the material in \nworkplace settings. Rather, as Ramboll states:  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 36  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have \nbeen studied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that many individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actuall y exposed \nto mixtures that included recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  \n \nSecond Ramboll Report, Executive Summary ( Appendix B ). Furthermore, Ramboll reviewed \nEPA\u2019s air modelling approach, and confirmed that it  was appropriate ( and conservative). \nRamboll states:  \n \nThe air modeling performed by EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to \nan acceptable margin of safety. The default assumptions of the air model are expected to \nproduce conservative air concentrations, and the definition of the receptor locations \nshould produce reasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors. In addition, the \nchronic and acute toxicity reference values used for the risk assessment are based on the \nbest available science.  \n \nId. Ramboll concludes:  \n \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll \ntherefore recommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard \nfor HCl be based on a health- based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n Id.  \n \nNLA requested that a second consultant, Trinity, also review EPA\u2019s air dispersion \nmodeling. Trinity also concluded that EPA\u2019s approach was correct. Trinity\u2019s report (accompanying these comments as Appendix C ), states:  \n \nWe did not find any material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the \nanalysis is consistent with prior methods for analyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has proposed an HBEL for HCl providing \nconservative estimates of concentrations in ambient air, the analysis relies on input data \nfrom the industry for the \u201cworst case\u201d sources and applied the air dispersion in a manner \nconsis tent with accepted practice. Therefore, we believe the predicted modeling impacts \nsupport EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime Manufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in the source category.\u201d  \n NLA strongly urges EPA to set a health -based standard for HCl, based on its own \nfindings and the confirmation provided by Ramboll  and Trinity. \n  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 37 D. Strong P olicy R easons Support  Concluding that HCl I s a T hreshold \nPollutant and P romulgating a Section 112(d)(4) S tandard  \n \nIn addition to the legal and technical arguments above, there are several strong policy \nreasons that should compel EPA to issue a s ection 112(d)(4) health- based standard for HCl in \nthis rulemaking. First, institutionally, EPA should always seek to preserve its regulatory \nauthority/flexibility in this context. And, given the powerful data in support of a health- based \nthreshold here, if  EPA concludes to the contrary, it is hard to see how EPA could ever \ndemonstrate a health threshold under s ection 112(d)(4). The Sierra Club court held that EPA is \nnot \u201cobligated to conclusively resolve every scientific uncertainty before it issues regulation.\u201d 895 F.3d at 10 (citations omitted). Specifically, relating to s ection 112(d)(4), the court held:  \n \nThe statutory term \u201cestablished\u201d does not unambiguously require that the \nEPA prove its scientific conclusions beyond all possible doubt. Nor does \nthe term \u201chealth threshold\u201d require that the EPA find a specific threshold \nthat lacks uncertainty. With respec t to scientific conclusions, \u201cestablished\u201d \nand \u201chealth threshold\u201d are ambiguous terms and we give deference to the \nEPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness.  \n \nId.  \n \nUnder this standard, it would clearly  be reasonable for EPA to conclude that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant in the context of this rulemaking. Indeed, a conclusion to the contrary would be a harmful precedent, given the evidence here, and it could be read to deprive EPA of the flexibility to use health -based standards as provided under the statute. Regulating HCl using a \nhealth -based standard f or lime is not only faithful to the intent of Congress in enacting s ection \n112(d)(4) and to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s concer ns as expressed in the Sierra Club decision , but is also \na reasonable and appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s discretion in setting standards for pollution \nprevention that protect the public with an ample margin of safety.  \n \nSecond, EPA should make it clear that even if it believes that it must set standards \npursuant to s ections 112(d)(2) and (3) for additional  HAPs, the provisions in the statute \nproviding for alternative approaches to the methods described in 112(d)(2) and (3) remain available to EPA . These include the provisions allowing a health -based standard under 112(d)(4), \nas well as the provisions providing for subcategories under 112(d)(1) and work practices under 112(h). In the case at hand, there is already a  robust existing record in support of a s ection \n112(d)(4) standard, and thus applying such a standard will not prolong the time needed to draft and promulgate a standard. \n \nFinally, use of a health -based standard would greatly simplify compliance (because there \nwould be a single standard rather than multiple subcategories), and it would also simplify  the \nissue of emissions averaging for HCl, because the health -based standard EPA suggests would be \na facility -wide standard, and not a standard for each individual kiln. EPA\u2019s own economic \nanalysis found that almost half of the capital costs of the rule (47%) are attributable to control of \nHCl. Promulgating a health- based standard would therefore significantly reduce the cost impact \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 38 of the rule on small businesses and on the lime industry, while  still protecting human health and \nthe environment.  \n \nUse of a health -based standard under s ection 112(d)(4) is particularly appropriate here. \nEPA used  two risk -based analyses and determined that there are no health risks from emissions \nof HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \u2014the first being EPA \u2019s evaluation of HCl health -based \nrisks in the original MACT rule, and the second being its section  112(f) risk analysis from the \n2020 lime RTR rule that there are no unacceptable risks from any pollutants regulated by the \nMACT standard.  \n E. How a Health -Based Standard Should Be Implemented \nIn the Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n Appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements would also be \nrequired to ensure compliance with the limit. The EPA is requesting comment on an \nappropriate structure for incorporating an HBEL in the rule text. Refer to the \nmemorandum, \u2018\u2018Revisions to 40 CFR part 63 Subpart AAAAA to Accommodate a \nHealth -Based Standard\u2019\u2019 , included in the docket for this rulemaking, for a description of \npotential revisions to the subpart to include initial compliance, continuous compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting rule language in support of an HBEL.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9094. EPA has informed NLA that the referenced docket item was not used  and \nthat the reference to it should have been deleted from the preamble, but that EPA seeks comment on potential revisions to the rule language. Below, NLA provides comment  on how a HBEL \nshould be implemented in the rule.  \n \nEPA states that, based on its analysis of risk, a  HBEL for HCl would be an emission limit \nof 300 tons per year, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). NLA agrees with EPA\u2019s \nevaluation that this standard would reflect acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety. (Indeed, as noted above, this standard is very conservative.)  \n \nThe HBEL standard would be applied on a source -wide basis  (as opposed to a kiln -by-\nkiln basis). This will necessitate some changes in rule language.  \n \nProposed \u00a763.7112(n) addresses computation of emission rates for HCl and mercury. \nBecause under the HBEL, emissions of HCl will not be calculated as a production -related  rate, \nthis section will need to be modified. Suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cBlueline,\u201d \nAppendix A.  \n \nNLA suggests  the following approach to demonstrate and document compliance with the \nHBEL for HCl , to be added to \u00a763.7112:  \n \nAn LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all lime kilns is below \n300 tpy and submit this with a Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS) before the compliance date.  The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test on each \nlime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of p ound s per ton of lime produced, \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 39 multiplied by the annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl \nfor all kilns at the site.  \n \nIf the LMP includes any kilns requiring add- on controls to comply with the HBEL, the \noperator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating parameter for \nother controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain compliance with \nthe HBEL. In this case, the LMP operator will submit documentation of the operating rate for DSI on units with controls, as applicable, and a compliance demonstration annually indicating actual emissions in the prior calendar year do not e xceed 300 tpy.  \n \nAlternatively, the facility may seek a practically enforceable permit provision from the LMP\u2019s local air permitting authority that limits HCl to no more than 300 tpy.  \n The LMP shall also certify in a  NOCS, by relying on the most recent HCl performance test \ndata for each kiln, that the sum of the hourly emissions rate (i.e., the sum of 3- run averages for \neach kiln at the site) is no greater than 685 lb/hr.  \n \n Sections of the rule relating to dry sorbent injection can be left in place to apply to those \nsources that may use DSI to  achieve the HBEL.  \n If EPA applies the HBEL, sections of the Proposed Rule  relating to emissions averaging \nwill not be necessary for HC l, because the standard is a sum of source -wide emissions and not an \naverage. These should be modified to remove references to HCl. These sections include \u00a763.7114 (b) and (c) , \u00a763.7121(g), and Table 9  (delete lines 1 through 6).  \n Table 1, lines 5 through 12, sh ould be replaced with \n \nFor\u2026  You must meet the following emission limit  \n5. All major sources  HCl emissions from all kilns must not exceed \n300 tons per year  (tpy) , and must not exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr)  \n Table 5, line 19, sh ould be replaced with:  \n           \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 40 For . . .

For a positive pressure FF or ESP, determine the number of sampling points per the stratification check procedures  of section  8.1.2 of \nMethod 7E using the sample \npoints determined using the \nprocedures of Section 8 of  \nEPA  Method  5D. \n \n Changes to other tables will not be necessary.  \n  NLA strongly urges EPA to adopt the suggested HBEL, for all the reasons stated above.  \n XIV. EPA ACTED REASONABLY IN PROPOSING  SUBCATEGORIES FOR HCL  \n As noted above, EPA should abide by its longstanding finding in 2004 that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant (and not a carcinogen) and should establish a health- based standard for HCl \npursuant to Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) in lieu of a MACT floor standard.  \n If, however, EPA continues to pursue non- health -based emissions standards for HCl, \nNLA supports the proposal to establish subcategories . NLA supports the six subcategories EPA \nhas proposed. EPA has made several technical corrections to the subcategory analyses and MACT floors  in the new Proposed Rule, which NLA supports .\n23 \n \nA. EPA H as Flexibility to Set Standards for S ubcategories  \n Clean Air Act s ection 112(d)(1) provides : \u201cThe Administrator may distinguish among \nclasses, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory in establishing such standards except that, there shall be no delay in the compliance date for any standard applicable to any source under subs ection (i) as the result of the authority provided by this sentence.\u201d  Under \nsection 112(d)(3) , the standard can be no less stringent than:  \n \n(A) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or \nwithin 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a \n \n22 See discussion below on the addition of Method 26.26A.  \n23 NLA\u2019s \u201cblueline\u201d of suggested rule language changes in Appendix B reflects inclusion of a health- based standard \nfor HCl. If EPA declines to set a health -based standard, several changes to the language would be required, as set \nout in this section, and in the section on emissions averaging above.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 41 level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the \nsource is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as \ndefined by section 7501 of this title) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory for categories and subcategories with 30 or more \nsources, or  \n(B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category \nor subcategory for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources.  \n \nAccordingly, if a subcategory has fewer than 30 sources, the standard is based on the average \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources.  \n \nEPA\u2019s decision to set subcategories  has been repeatedly upheld by the courts. In Sierra \nClub v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018), the court upheld EPA\u2019s  decision to establish \nsubcategories for brick kilns by size. In setting a brick MACT floor, EPA set separate standards for PM (used as a surrogate for non -mercury hazardous metals) and mercury, with subcategories \nfor large tunnel and small tunnel brick ki lns. NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products \nManufacturing; and NESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufacturing, 80 Fed. Reg. 65470, 65471 \n(Oct. 26, 2015) .  \n In U.S. Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 2016), the court upheld EPA\u2019s \nestablishment of subcategories for major boilers (based on primary fuel combusted and method \nused to feed the boiler), and for area boilers (based on size) . The court held that EPA \u2019s creation \nof subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers burned was based on a reasonable interpretation of CAA provisions  permitting EPA to distinguish among \u201cclasses, types, and \nsizes\u201d of sources when establishing hazardous air  pollutant emissions standards, and was not \narbitrary and capricious, even though a single boiler could use different fuels over the course of \nits lifetime . EPA explained that boilers varied in their designs depending on the  type of fuel they \nburned, which affected boiler emissions and the feasibility of emissions controls. Id. a t 656. EPA \ndemonstrated with sufficient evidence that burning a different fuel made a boiler a different type of boiler, and thus EPA \u2019s creation of subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers \nburned was not arbitrary or capricious . Id. a t 657.  \n  In the Proposed Rule , EPA base s its HCl subcategories on two factors that affect HCl \nemissions, as shown by data analyzed by EPA \u2014kiln type (preheater rotary, straight rotary, and \nvertical), and lime product produced (high calcium lime and dolomitic lime). EPA reasonably determined that these differences in equipment and in product resulted in differences in \nemissions that justify establishment of subcategories. NLA fully supports this determination, as \nexplained in more detail below . \n \nThe proposed HCl subcategories for the lime manufacturing industry are based on kiln \ntype (i.e., straight rotary, preheater rotary, and vertical ), and lime product (high calcium \nquicklime or dolomitic lime) . The six subcategories proposed by EPA are : \n \na. Straight rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nb. Straight rotary kilns making high calcium  quicklime   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 42 c. Preheater rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead- burned dolomitic lime  \nd. Preheater rotary kilns making high calcium quicklime  \ne. Vertical kilns making dolomitic quicklime and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nf. Vertical kilns making high calcium quicklime  \n \nNLA supports these subcategories , which are explored in more detail below. \n \nB. Subcategorization by Kiln Type  Is Appropriate \n \nSubcategorization by kiln type include s the following:  \n \na. Straight Rotary  kilns  \nb. Preheater Rotary  kilns  \nc. Vertical kilns  \n \nHCl emissions from rotary kilns equipped with a preheater are typically lower than a \nstraight rotary kiln with no preheater. This is because , among other things, HCl that exits the kiln \ncan be chemically adsorbed by lime (CaO) and limestone (CaCO 3) in the preheater  section of the \nkiln. This has the overall effect of lowering HCl stack emissions. In addition, the stack \ntemperature of a preheater kiln is lower than a straight rotary kiln , which lowers HCl formation.  \n \nConversely, a straight rotary kiln with no preheater and similar inputs has HCl emissions \nhigher than a preheater equivalent. Both kiln types will have some adsorption of HCl in the rotary kiln, but a straight rotary kiln does not have the additional oppor tunity for HCl adsorption \nin the preheater.  \n \nVertical lime kilns also have a different emissions profile from straight kilns. In vertical \nkilns, close contact between the gases in the kiln and the stone and lime tends to scrub out HCl emissions.  \n C. Subcategorization by Lime Product Produced  Is Appropriate  \n \nIn addition to kiln type, lime sources should be further subcategorized by product type , as \nEPA proposed:  \n \na. High calcium quicklime  \nb. Dolomitic lime  (and dead- burned dolomitic lime)  \n \nThe data in the record show that kilns producing dolomitic lime consistently have \nsignificantly higher HCl emissions than kilns producing high calcium lime (this is true even \nwhen the two kinds of product are produced in the same kiln). These differences are due to \ndifferences i n the stone feedstock, and not because of fuels or equipment. Dolomitic lime is \nmade from naturally occurring stone with a higher percentage of magnesium chloride than high calcium quickl ime. Also, it should be noted that dolomitic l ime and high calcium quick lime are \ndifferent products and have different uses and markets. Accordingly, the differences in HCl \nemissions between these two types of lime are appropriate for subcategorization.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 43  \nD. Subcategory for Vertical Kilns Making Dolomitic Lime  \n \nData submitted to EPA pursuant to the previous Information Collection Request (ICR) \ndid not include data on vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime, so in the January 2023 Proposed Rule, E PA grouped all vertical kilns into  a single category. NLA \u2019s prior comments noted, \nhowever, that in  categorizing HCl emissions, vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime should be \ngrouped with preheater kilns producing dolomitic lime, because in this case, similarities related to product type are more significant than similar ities in kiln equipment.\n In the 2004 Proposed \nRule, EPA places vertical kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime into their \nown subcategory, but with the same applicable HCl standard as  preheater kilns making these products. NLA supports this change.  \n  \nXV. HCL \u2014TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nA. The MACT F loor C alculations for HCl Have Been Properly Corrected for \nthe Straight Rotary High Calcium Quicklime ( SR, QL) and Preheater \nRotary, High Calcium Quicklime  (PR, QL), Except that the Limit for \nStraight Rotary Kilns Making Quicklime Has Been Incorrectly Calculated  \n \nIn EPA\u2019s prior MACT floor analysis, five kiln s were miscategorized as preheater rotary \nkilns, when in fact  they are straight rotary kiln s. EPA has properly corrected this error, which \naffects the MACT floor numbers for the SR , QL and PR , QL subcategories , except that the limit \nfor straight rotary kilns making quicklime has been incorrectly calculated (see discussion below) . \nThe necessary corrections were detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments, which are incorporated here \nby reference.

NLA supports this change.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 44 Note:  \n1 - Straight Rotary (SR), preheater rotary (PR), vertical (VK)  \n2 - Dolomitic lime ( DL), high- calcium quicklime (QL), dead burned dolomite (DB)  \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Emission Limit  for HCl from Existing Straight Kilns Producing \nQuicklime  Must Be Corrected  \nEPA\u2019s proposed emission limit for existing straight kilns producing quicklime is \ncalculated using an upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation that incorrectly assumes that the \ndata set is statistically skewed. This approach does not follow EPA guidance or prior precedent.  In fact, EPA has arbitrarily deviated from prior UP L calculation precedent, applying a new \nprocedural precedent to set this UPL limitation.   \nFollowing the instructions in EPA\u2019s own UPL calculation tool used in prior iterations of \nthis rulemaking and in other similar UPL limit setting exercises, the data set should be considered \u201clognormal .\u201d However, with respect to  this particular standard, EPA has arbitrarily \napplied a new statistical test, the Shapiro -Wilk test, which identified the data set as \u201cskewed\u201d. \nThe use of the Shapiro -Wilk test is not included in EPA guidance regarding the use of UPLs nor \nis NLA aware of any precedent for using this test in UPL MACT setting rulemakings. Further, \nEPA\u2019s memorandum Use of the Upper Prediction Limit for Calculating MACT Floors  included \nin this docket states: \u201cTo evaluate the distribution of  the data, EPA checks each dataset for \ndistribution characteristics by applying skewness and kurtosis tests.\u201d  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015- 0177)  Thus, EPA\u2019s established method already applies skewness and kurtosis tests, \nrendering it unnecessary and unreasonable in this  case to use the Shapiro -Wilk test.  \n \nIn this case, EPA apparently first evaluated the dataset in its traditional method using its \nUPL Calculation tool. As mentioned above, EPA\u2019s tool clearly concludes that the dataset is lognormal , resulting in a UPL limitation of 2. 58 lb/ ton lime produced. For reasons that are \nunclear , EPA abandoned the established approach and applied a new procedure, the Shapiro-\nWilk test, to conclude the dataset is \u201cskewed ,\u201d resulting in a much lower  UPL limitation of 0.52 \nlb/ton lime produced.  \n \nThe Shapiro- Wilk test is a statistically conservative methodology for determining \nwhether a data set is normal or lognormally distributed. This methodology only allows for a very narrow band of p- values to \u201cpass\u201d the normality test. The Shapiro- Wilk test is known to be \nconservative, especially for larger data sets as all data must be in a  narrow range. In other words, \nthis Shapiro- Wilk test significantly increases  the likelihood of a finding that  a dataset is \n\u201cskewed\u201d and not \u201clognormal .\u201d \n Although this methodology is not supported by precedent in EPA\u2019s extensive  history of \nsetting MACT limits, NLA has reviewed this data set using this test. As shown in graph below, the data set using this new test is not normally distributed because a small subset of values lie \nslightly outside of the p- value allowable range.  Th e outcome is that EPA\u2019s proposed limitation \nis substantially and unreasonably lowered.  \n \n \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 45 Figure 1 \u2013 Illustration of the Shapiro - Wilk Test Results and Corresponding P -values  \n \n \n  \nIn the figure , the limited data points outside the blue shaded areas force the conservative \nconclusion from the Shapiro- Wilk test that the dataset is \u201cskewed\u201d contrary to EPA\u2019s \nconventional normality tests for setting UPLs. \n \nIn addition to the arbitrary application of the Shapiro -Wilk test, and EPA\u2019s failure to \nfollow its own established procedures, the calculated emission limit fails to  develop an emission \nlimit that is achievable even by the MACT Floor sources. EPA utilizes the UPL methodology to \ncalculate an emission limit that MACT Floor sources are capable of meeting within 99% certainty. In this case, n ot only is the proposed limit equal to the average result of one of the \nMACT Floor sources, two of the three runs for tha t kiln are equal to or greater than the proposed \nlimit. Establishing an emission limit with which even the MACT Floor sources cannot continuously comply does not meet Clean Air Act MACT limit requirements. This outcome is \nunlawful and further demonstrates  that EPA\u2019s new use of the Shapiro- Wilk test does not properly \nset a MACT UPL limitation.  \n \nEPA should set the limitation based on its traditional method using its UPL Calculation \nTool and set  the limitation for this subcategory at 2.58 lb/ ton lime produced. \n \nC. EPA Should Authorize Use of Method 26/26A to Measure HCl   \nMethod 26/26A should be allowed by EPA to determine compliance with the proposed \nHCl emissions limits. Method 26/26A (used in testing HC l) was omitted from  Table 7 in the \npreamble to the January 2023 Proposed Rule  (88 F ed. Reg. 815) , and is also absent from Table 5, \nRow 19, in the redline in the docket . Method 26/26A is a standard isokinetic method that can be \nrun concurrently with PM sampling.  \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 46  \nIn Method 26/26A, gas is withdrawn from the source and collected directly in acidified \nimpingers. The impinger solution captures the HCl, and drives it to chloride ions, where it is analyzed by ion-chromatography. This is a simple approach that does not have the sample trans port difficulties found in the direct interface FTIR approach. It is one of EPA\u2019s promulgated \nmethods ( see https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-promulgated- test-methods\n; see a lso 40 CFR Part \n60, Appendix A-8), and it is allowed in other NESHAP rules ( see, e.g., 40 CFR section 63.7520 \nand Table 5  (boilers and process heaters)). Method 26/26A has several advantages over the more \ntechnically complex and expensive M.320/321. I t can allow for significantly lower detection \nlimits, does not require a trained FTIR specialist on site to operate the equipment, and is significantly quicker. The limited availability of trained FTIR specialists will be problematic for both the lime industry and the testing industry. Additional costs are significant and can easily be greater than $10K/plant using FTIR. M26/26A is a tried and tested accepted method for HCl analyses and is allowed for compliance demonstration in other industries, including in EPA\u2019s recent final taconite rule. \n  EPA should authorize the use of Method 26/26A as an approved method for HCl \ncompliance testing.  References to Method 26/26A should be added to \u00a763.7142, Table 4 line 1, \nand Table 5 line 19.  MERCURY  \n XVI. EPA SHOULD APPLY AN INTRA- QUARRY VARIABILITY FACTOR FOR \nMERCURY  \n On December 9, 2021, NLA\u2019s consultant Trinity Consultants submitted a memorandum \n(EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0074), explaining how EPA should set an intra -quarry va riability \nfactor (IQV) for mercury for lime plants, with supporting data. In the new Proposed Rule , EPA \nhas proposed an IQV, and NLA commends EPA for doing so. However, NLA believes that the IQV proposed by EPA should be adjusted to allow sources more flexibility in meeting mercury standards.  \nThe purpose of an IQV is to account for long-term variation in mercury content \nthroughout the quarry and has been incorporated into other standards with significantly sparser  \ndata than the lime  industry has provided. It is important to note that IQV stands for intra -quarry \nvariability, not inter- quarry variability. The point of the exercise is to understand how mercury \nconcentrations may vary in each quarry over time. \n NLA believes that in a case in which emissions of mercury are not controlled by add -on \npollution control devices, but rather depend on inputs from feedstocks, it would be arbitrary and capricious not to apply a reasonable IQV. Without an IQV, the MACT floor \u201cbest performer\u201d \u2014\nthe source that currently has the lowest mercury emissions\u2014could later find itself in violation of the standard if it is excavating limestone  with higher mercury levels from a different part of the \nquarry. The concept of the MACT floor p erformers is that these sources can meet the standard \nwithout additional controls\u2014something EPA cannot assert  for mercury in this rulemaking \nwithout applying an appropriate IQV.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 47  \nSufficient data is available to establish an IQV for the lime industry . As provided in \nAppendix I (1-13) to NLA\u2019s prior comments  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0166) , the lime \nindustry has 422 kiln feed samples as well as 61 samples from the Eden, Wisconsin quarry. This \nis substantially  more data than found in the docket for the Brick and Structural Clay Products \nNESHAP , for which  EPA promulgated an IQV standard. Nationwide, the Brick/Clay industry \nprovided 167 samples and the final IQV used in calculating the mercury standard for their \nindustry was based on seven samples from four plants.27 \n \nA. EPA Should Use Quarry Data from the MACT Floor Sources  \n \nAn intra -quarry variability (IQV) factor would account for variability in the mercury \ncontent of the raw material over the long- term life of the quarry. NLA\u2019s suggested approach to \nachieving  this objective is  well documented and supported by information supplied to EPA  \nduring its rulemaking process. The data showed that intr a-quarry variability of mercury in the \nreal world is relatively high , and would have a significant impact on the mercury MACT floor . \nThis is a strong justification for applying an IQV, n ot a reason for declining to do so.   \n \nThe Eden quarry samples are more representative of this long- term variability  than are \nkiln feed samples, because  they represent limestone that will be used in the kiln over the life of \nthe quarry. S amples that represent the life of the quarry are far more representative of IQV than \nmaterials stockpiled over hours, days or a week in transient short -term stockpiles.  In addition, the \nsamples from the Eden quarry were taken from drill holes throughout the quarry and at approximately 6- foot intervals. As such, each sample represents a section of the quarry that \nwould be mined over decades of quarry operation. As such, the originally proposed IQV based on data  for the two MACT floor plants , which includes quarry samples  from Eden  and kiln feed \nsamples from both plants, is appropriate for setting a UPL -based standard. In addition, EPA \nshould use this quarry  data because it represents the MACT floor source.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Use of Weighted Average Data in the Intra -Quarry Variability I s Not \nTechnically Sound, and EPA Should Use the Calculations Provided by NLA  \nNLA is pleased that EPA now proposes to apply an IQV based on data from the two \nMACT floor sources. However, EPA\u2019s calculation of the IQV must be corrected.  \n The methodology utilized by EPA in the proposed rulemaking does not properly reflect \nthe variability of mercury content in limestone  that should be reflected in an emissions limitation \nfor a lime kiln. As detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments on this rulemaking, an IQV is utilized to incorporate variability in limestone mercury content into the upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation used in developing an emission lim it.  \n In NLA\u2019s proposed methodology for applying an IQV to this rulemaking, limestone \nmercury content for the two kilns in the MACT floor were utilized to calculate an IQV. The proposed rulemaking also uses this data set, but EPA chose to use weighted average mercury content rather than individual test values. Limestone samples collected from each of the five \n \n27 EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0660, Appendix E  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 48 boreholes collected from a MACT pool quarry were weighted to reduce bias from varying \nsample interval thicknesses.  Weighted sample data enables meaningful comparison across the \nquarry and within each geological unit. In other words, sample weighting supports compar ison \nfor geological study purposes , but weighting is not appropriate for an IQV calculation where \ncapturing variability is necessary  and appropriate .28 \nA consequence of sample weighting is to lower the standard deviation of the data set , and \nlower the relative standard deviation, which significantly  reduces the IQV and corresponding \nemission rate, as much of the variability in the data set is averaged out. A data set of 70 data \npoints was reduced to only 7 with EPA\u2019s approach, thus mathematically suppressing the natural \nvariability that the IQV must account for.  \n An IQV is intended to adjust a UPL -based emission limit to reflect the expected stack \ntesting results for the MACT Floor sources for any reasonably expected mercury content. By \nusing weighted averages, EPA\u2019s calculations assume that all limestone in each core sample \nwould have the same mercury content or be burned during a single stack test. However, e ach of \nthese core samples represents a larger volume of stone across the deposit (in contrast  to the \nspecific grab sample data). Furthermore, using averages r eflects false assumption with respect to \nhow the quarry will be mined in practice , and how the mine\u2019s  stone will eventually be processed \nin a lime kiln , and when mercury would actually be emitted. That is, any single  (unaveraged) Hg \ndata point could represent stone fed to a kiln over any one day, month or year.  \n \nTherefore, EPA should not apply quarry data averaging and should rather base the \nexisting source Hg limitation on NLA\u2019s originally proposed mercury emission limit of 50.0 \npounds mercury per million tons of limit produced. This  remains the appropriate emission limit \nfor existing sources.  \n \nC. EPA\u2019s Proposal to Not Use the Best Performing Emission Source to Set the  \nMercury Limit for New Kilns I s Arbitrary and Unlawful  \nEPA evaluated two options for setting the mercury emission limit for new kilns, one \nusing the best performing source (at Graymont\u2019s Eden Plant) and one using the second- best \nperforming source (at Carmeuse\u2019s Maysville Plant) . EPA proposes to set the new kiln limit based \non the Maysville Plant . In each case, EPA included an IQV using the mercury limestone content \ndata for only that plant. As a result, EPA sets a lower standard for new kilns that it would have \nset based on the best performing plant, because of the difference in IQVs.  \n The Maysville Plant has only seven mercury content values on which to set an IQV , all \nbased on limestone feed data during two events. The Eden Plant data set is more extensive with \ncore data sampling throughout the quarry which better represents the mercury variability of the \nquarry over time. The  Maysville feed data is much more limited, and thus less able to show the \nvariability t hroughout the full quarry. A ny new kiln may be built at a limestone quarry with \nvarying mercury content similar to the Eden Pla nt quarry. It  is unreasonable to assume that any \nfuture kiln would have homogenous mercury content throughout its  limestone supply (and \nindeed, feed pile data may not accurately indicate mercury content in the quarry, because, as \n \n28 A more detailed explanation of this point is set out in NLA member Graymont\u2019s separate comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 49 EPA notes in the preamble, feed piles represent only a small portion of the quarry, and not a mix \nof multiple areas of the quarry ).  \n \nNotwithstanding the comments on calculating the IQV, setting an emission limit for new \nsources that is not based on the best -performing emission unit does not align with EPA policies \nand precedent. The Eden Plant kiln is the best -performing emission unit a nd based on available \nmercury data for the Eden quarry this unit itself cannot be reasonably assured to comply with the \nproposed emission limit  for new kilns .  \n \nEPA should set the new source emission limit based on the best -performing source rather \nthan arbitrarily using the second- best source.  \n \nORGANICS  \n \nXVII.  USE OF THC AS A SURROGATE FOR ORGANIC HAPS  IS UNLAWFUL   \n In its comments on the January 23, 2023, Proposed Rule  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0166) , NLA submitted extensive information demonstrating that Total Hydrocarbons (THC) \ncannot  be used as a surrogate for organic HAPs, because emissions of THC do not correlate with \nemissions of organic HAPs. Because EPA has appropriately decided not to use THC in this way, those points are not repeated here, but are incorporated herein by reference.  \n \nXVIII.  EPA \u2019S PROPOSAL TO SET AN AGGREGATED (TOTAL) ORGANIC HAP \nSTANDARD IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH , BUT CORRECTIONS ARE \nNEEDED  \n A. NLA Supports EPA \u2019s Proposal to S et a S tandard B ased on O rganic HAPs \nDetected and M easured at L ime P lants  \n In a December 6, 2021, memorandum  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0068) , NLA urged \nEPA to adopt an emission standard based on an aggregate of organic HAPs , similar to the \nalternative that was established for  the cement industry. NLA performed, with the help of a well -\nrespected  technical consultant  (Alliance  Tech nical Group (\u201cAlliance \u201d)), a comprehensive review \nof oHAP testing done during the rule development period. Rather than focusing only on the nine  \noHAPs that were previously submitted, the consultant thoroughly reviewed the Method 320 \nspectra fro m twelve stack tests conducted at major source lime kilns in order to identify all \ndetectable oHAPs in the tests. This review  resulted in the identification of six  additional oHAPs  \n(including the four identi fied by EPA) , providing a complete picture of oHAPs present using \napproved test methods , as shown on Table IV below . More details on this analysis are found in \nNLA\u2019s prior comments and its appendices , EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0166.  \n \nNLA, with the assistance of Alliance, generated a table including the complete list of \nidentified oHAPs that could be included in an aggregated oHAP alternative. This list includes (a) all oHAP s detected using EPA methods M.18 and M.320 and specific to lime kilns identified in \nstack test reports provided to EPA  in the 2016 s ection 114 ICR, and as part of a voluntary collect  \nion effort by the industry in 2021- 22, and (b) 6 additional oHAPs identified by new review of the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 50 test spectra, including all four of the additional oHAPs  identified by EPA in the January 2023 \nProposed Rule preamble (88 Fed. Reg. 813). The frequency of detection for each HAP is also \nshown. \n \nTable B: Organic HAP from Lime Kilns and Representative Method Detection Limits \nParts per Million Adjusted to 7 Percent O 2, Dry1 \nPARAMETER  Analytical \nMethod  RDL  (ppm)  3x RDL  Frequency of \nDetection3 \nBenzene  M.18  0.025  0.075  8/16 \nCarbon Disulfide2 M.18  0.201  0.603  4/12 \nEthyl Benzene2 M.18  0.024  0.072  6/10 \nNaphthalene  M.18  0.0068  0.020  4/12 \nStyrene  M.18  0.0036  0.011  4/14 \nToluene  M.18  0.011 0.033  6/16 \nVinyl Chloride2 M.18  0.268  0.804  7/12 \nXylenes (Mixture of o, m, \nand p Isomers)4 M.18 0.0235 0.071 9/26 \n1,3-Butadiene5 M.320  0.268 0.804 7/12 \nAcetaldehyde  M.320  0.596  1.788  4/14 \nAcrolein2,5 M.320  0.670  2.010  2/12 \nFormaldehyde  M.320  0.521  1.563  8/14 \nMethanol5 M.320  0.223 0.669 8/12  \nTOTAL   2.8 8.5 77/182 (42%) \n \nNotes  \n1. Assumes 10 percent moisture content.  \n2. In the January 2023  Proposed Rule  preamble, EPA \u201calso identified additional organic HAP pollutants in \nthe analyses including the pollutants acrolein, carbon disulfide, ethyl benzene, and vinyl chloride .\u201d These \nHAPs were also identified in the retroactive review of M.320 FTIR spectra from 12 samples . \n3. Frequency of Detection using approved EPA methods i.e., M.18 and M.320 from stack tests provided in 2016 ICR , supplemental test data provided by industry, and retroactive M.320 review performed by \nAlliance . \n4. Detection limit shown for xylenes is the sum of individual isomers (o- xylene = 0.0073, m -xylene = 0.0075, \np-xylene = 0.0087) (all ppmvd@7% O\n2). \n5. HAP was detected as part of retroactive review of M.320 FTIR spectra from 12 samples.  \n \nThe representative detection limits  (provided by Alliance based on its laboratory \nexperience and expertise) were multiplied by three and then summed for an aggregate total of 8.5 ppmv at 7% O\n2 dry, assuming 10 percent moisture content. NLA\u2019s prior comments urged EPA to \nselect this  aggregated limit as a reasonable threshold for organic HAP based on the specificity of \nthe HAP emitted from lime kilns combined with the low concentration and detection frequency.  \n This approach to an oHAP limitation is consistent with the C lean A ir Act and EPA\u2019s \nprecedents in establishing MACT emissions limitations . As noted above, THC is an \ninappropriate surrogate for organic HAPs in the lime industry . An aggregated (total) oHAP limit, \non the other hand, is a better option because it causes the allowable emission limit to be directly linked to the regulated pollutants and excludes irrelevant substances  that THC would include. \nThe use of an aggregated oHAP alternative was used in the Portland Cement  MACT , \nrecognizing inherent differences in emissions of oHAPs and THC from cement kilns. Lastly, the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 51 proposed aggregated oHAP limit follows established conventions that EPA is proposing for D/F \nin this rulemaking. The limit for D/F is based on the aggregate amount of D/F congeners and \ngiven their very low levels below detection limits, the use of three times the Representative Detection Limit (3xRDL) setting method is appropriate in such cases.\n29,30 \n \n Use of an aggregated oHAP limit is also appropriate here because of the very low oHAP \nemissions, the very low detection limits for many of the substances, the sporadic appearance of \nthese substances (note that no HAP listed above appeared in all tests, and many were not \ndetected in a majority of tests) ,31 and EPA\u2019s prior determination that risks from organic HAPs \nare acceptable with an ample margin of safety even with no additional controls at all.  Overall, the \nuse of a n aggregated  organic HAP limitation is superior to THC as a surrogate and should be \nincorporated into the final rulemaking. \n \nThus, EPA should use an aggregated oHAP approach as the emission standard for lime \nplants . Under this approach, sources would perform 5- year compliance testing for all the oHAPs \non the list, and compliance would be based on the total aggregate detected being lower than the aggregate standard. Continuous compliance would be ensured by parametric monitoring of air pollution control devices.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Proposed 8 -HAP Aggregate oHAP Standard Must Be Corrected  \nNLA is pleased that EPA has adopted the approach of setting an aggregate oHAP \nstandard  based on the sum of 3 times the representative detection limit (RDL) of a group of \noHAPs. EPA has proposed to base the standard on 8 organics (as opposed to the 15 set out by NLA), as follows:  \n        \n      \n \n29 See EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117.

(Alliance\u2019s report is Appendix D , and the accompanying Excel \nspreadsheets have been submitted separately as Appendix D2.)  \n EPA\u2019s proposed RDLs for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde differ substantially from the \nRDLs calculated and submitted by Alliance. While there are also differences with respect to the other HAPs on the list  between EPA\u2019s proposal and Alliance\u2019 s suggested values , they vary much \nless. These differences appear to stem from differences in how detection limits are set for HAPs measured using Method 320 (used for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) , and those measured \nusing Method 18 (used for the other oHAPs on EPA\u2019s  list). With Method 18, each analytical \nlaboratory typically uses a standard detection limit, based on testing of that lab\u2019s equipment and its capabilities. These tend to be similar to each other  across the analytical service industry , and \nthus there is not likely to be a large range of values. With Method 320, on the other hand, a detection limit is calculated with respect to each test that is performed, and it can vary substantially, particularly if proper procedures are not followed in determining the detection limit.  \n In developing its proposed RDLs for the 8 HAPs, EPA averaged the five lowest detection \nlimits used in tests for each HAP. This averaging approach did not produce anomalous results for \nHAPs tested using Method 18 because, as noted above , labs use a single value for all tests, and \nthey tend to be similar. However, as detection limits for Method 320 tests vary due to factors \nother than the lab\u2019s capability, arbitrary use of the five lowest values creates anomalous results, and does not generate a representativ e value. Instead of averaging only the five lowest detection \nlimits, EPA should (at least for the Method 320 tests), average all of the detection limits, to \ngenerate a more representative result. In setting the similar aggregated standard in the cement \nrule, EPA averaged the detection limits for all tests, and it should follow that precedent in this \nrule as well.  The purpose of averaging is to identify representative detection limits, not to \nidentify the arguably best performing labs.  \n \n \n32 Note: There is a calculation error in the proposed chart from the preamble. The 3xRDL value shown for toluene is \nonly 2 times the RDL, not 3 times as it should be. This should be corrected, and the correct number should be .042 \n(although the sum still rou nds to 1.7).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 53 Further review by Alliance of the same source testing reports used by EPA in its \nevaluation  revealed that some of the detection limits from stack tests should not have been used \nto calculate RDLs . Removing those results from the averaging yields a smaller number of tests to \nbe averaged, making the consideration of the issue of whether to average only the lowest results \nunnecessary.  \n \n  The discussion below explains why several  source testing  reports should be removed \nfrom EPA\u2019s analysis  and from the computed average. It also discusses several other corrections \nto the calculations that should be made. For the reasons discussed above, t his discussion \naddresses only the Method 320 HAPs (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde), because revision of the Method 18 results would not alter the final limit significantly.  \n1. EPA Should U se Method Detection Limits Determined O nly U sing t he \nMDC #2 Approach  \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data used \nby EPA . Both are from ASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA \nMethod 320, which is the standard method for FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from \nstationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL documentation, and are thus not \nincluded in further discussion, because it cannot be determined if proper methods were used to \ngenerate the MDLs used in those reports.  \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the \ndetector noise in a pure blank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound. This is \nuseful to determine the analytical uncertainty of a value, but it is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the \nnoise of the detector, but with the inclusion of major matrix interference. This is generally \nregarded as a more appropriate MDL determination since FTIR is an optical measur ement, and \nelevated absorbances from interference can significantly impact the analyzers ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration). Past EPA guidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for  data , and Allianc e confirms that MDC#2 is the preferred \napproach for this analysis . \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2 \n(see Tables 1 & 2). EPA\u2019s calculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four \nreports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the determination of the proposed measurement limit.  \nEPA should revise  the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard \ndirective of using MDC#2 calculated results to determine an appropriate calculation of a \nrepresentative detection limit. As the charts below show, when only MDC#2 results are used, \ndifferent (and higher) average values for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are produced.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 54 Table  D: Comparison of Detection Limits for M320 oHAPs Between MDC#1 and \nMDC#2 Procedures  \n \n  \n \n EPA should revise its RDL calculations to reflect these corrected values from Table 2 for \nthe two method 320 HAPs. \n2. MDLs Should be Summed on the Same Basis of Moisture and Oxygen  \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet basis (i.e., not corrected for moisture) , and \ndry corrected basis. This creates a certain amount of noise in the data set. Ultimately the detection limit values in the Proposed Rule  do not appear to contain a correction for moisture in \nthe source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other components. For example,  if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture \ncorrected basis from a source that contains 1 5% moisture , the result  becomes 1.176 ppmvd. \nWhere results from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same \nbasis, rather than a mix of wet and dry corrected results. As this total result may contain some \nmix of detected and non -detected compounds, the MDLs used for this standard setting should \ninclude this adjustment criteria.  \nSimilarly , as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, an  \naverage oxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the floor calculation. These corrections are included in the discussion of a bulk correction factor \nbelow. \n3. EPA Should U se a Bulk Average Correction Factor  \nIn the Proposed Rule , the value s of multiple chemical species are summed to determine \ncompliance with a limit that is based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen \nconcentration. V alues included in the summation must be corrected to this basis. To  set an \nemissions limit that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to \nmatch before  including them in the sum. From the reports reviewed by Alliance, the average \ncombined correction factor results in an increase of 22% to the re sults. However , Alliance notes  \nthat this is a source -specific correction factor depending on the moisture and oxygen content \nnative to the source. As such, attempting to normalize the limit based on adjusted results can \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 55 have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions. Given the variability, \nAlliance recommends  taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating \nthe standard . \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those \ncases the individual sources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table. Three reports \nwere excluded due to the variety of testing conditions that included abnormally high or low \noxygen and moisture concentrations . \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) \ndetermined by separately averaging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average \ncorrection factor for each. These average factors were then combined for a total correction factor. \nA second calculation determines the total correction factor for each source, then looks at an \naverage of these bulk correction factors. Both calculations are presented in Alliance\u2019s  Table \nreproduced below. Notably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the average of total factors from each report. \nTable  E: Summary of Moisture and Oxygen Correction Factors to Be Applied to \nDetection Limits  \n \n  Accordingly, EPA should apply a bulk correction factor of 1.217 to the RDL calculations \nfor formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  \n4. EPA Should U se Corrected M.320 Method Detection Limits  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the emissions limit determination, and accounting for \nthe corrections that must be applied to all formaldehyde and acetaldehyde data for summation, \nAlliance\u2019s  analysis shows a  standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 ppmvd @7% O\n2 \nformaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O 2 for acetaldehyde. Therefore, EPA should adopt these \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 56 RDLs  for use in the aggregated oHAP limit.  As shown in the table  below, correcting these values \nresults in an aggregated emission limit of 5.9 ppmvd @ 7% O 2, and EPA should adopt this value  \nas the limit in the final rule.  \nTable  F: Proposed Aggre gate oHAP Limi t with Corrections Applied  \n \nPollutant  RDL (ppmvd @  \n7 percent O2)  3xRDL (ppmvd  \n@ 7 percent O2)  \nFormaldehyde  0.88 2.64 \nAcetaldehyde  0.94 2.82 \nToluene  0.014  0.042 \nBenzene  0.022  0.066  \nXylenes (mixture of m,  \no, and p isomers)  0.023  0.069  \nStyrene  0.0043  0.013  \nEthyl benzene  0.057  0.18 \nNaphthalene  0.0081  0.025  \n                                                  TOTAL  5.9 \n \n5. EPA Should Allow the Use of Zero for Non -Detected oHAPs , and Should \nRevise the Definition of Total Organic HAPs  \n \nWithin the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d in \u00a763.7143 in the docket redline, EPA \nstates:  \n If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the  \nmethod defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the  \nmeasured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total organic HAP value.  \n This approach is unreasonable as applied to non- detect results. This approach would guarantee \nthat each measurement would result in a total of  at least one third of the standard, even if no \noHAPs were detected at all. Considering that the aggregate standard is already extremely low, EPA\u2019s treatment of non- detects will lead to  erroneous over -estimation and potential false non-\ncompliance results .  \n \nRather, for results below the detection limit, a value of 0 should be used for that HAP , \nsince the HAP was not in fact detected.  Note again , as shown above, that for the 8 oHAPs EPA \nproposes to use in the aggregate  standard , only two were found in more than half of the tests  \nreviewed, and none w as found in all tests. There is no reason to assume that an undetected oHAP \nis present in any test. Using 0 would also be consistent with the method EPA applies in the Proposed Rule  with dioxin/furan congeners that are below the detection limit.\n33 \n  In addition, the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d should not refer to \u201cmethod detec tion \nlevels,\u201d because this is likely to cause confusion. Rather, it should refer to the Representative \n \n33 While NLA believes that zero is the appropriate value to use for non- detects, EPA could, in the alternative, use \none half of the RDL, as it has done in other contexts.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 57 Detection Limits (RDLs) as specified in the table in the preamble.  If EPA declines to use zero for \nnon-detects, then it should include the table of RDLs in the final rule language and  should revise \nthe provision above to read \u201c ...you must use the method detection l evel or the representative \ndetection level (RDL) as listed in Table __, whichever is lower , as the measured emissions level \nfor that pollutant\u2026.\u201d  The lower of these two figures should be used, because the RDL is the \nsource of the standard, and undetected levels should not be presumed to be higher than the RDL.  \n \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nXIX. EPA LACKS SUFFICIENT DATA TO SET A MACT FLOOR FOR DIOXINS AND FURANS , AND SHOULD ISSUE A NEW ICR FOR DIOXIN/FURAN DATA  \n \nEPA proposes to set a MACT floor for dioxins and furans  (D/F)  for all major lime \nsources based on data from only two lime kilns \u2014one with non- detectable amounts of D/F, and \nanother with very low but detectable amounts. EPA rejected all other D/F data submitted by the industry based on determinations that the test methods used were not recognized by EPA , or for \nother technical reasons.  Based on these two data points, EPA proposes to set a MACT floor for \nthe entire industry\u201496 lime kilns \u2014assuming that MACT floor for the industry should be set \nbased on non- detectable amounts of D/F.  \n \nEPA provides no data indicating that the tests from these two lime kilns \u2014either \nindividually or taken together \u2014are representative of the emissions of the lime industry. It is \narbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a standard based on such limited data. Chem.  Mfg.  Ass\u2019n  v \nEPA, 28 F.3d 1259, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (\u201c\u2026we conclude that it was arbitrary and capricious \nfor the EPA to list MDI as a high- risk pollutant solely upon the basis of the RfC for MDI, \nwithout identifying any serious health effect with whic h it has ever been associated\u201d). EPA \nshould withdraw the proposed D/F standard and issue a new Information Collection Request to collect sufficient data to make a statistically valid determination of a proper MACT standard.  \n  Pursuing a new Information Collection Request for D/F would have multiple benefits. \nFirst, and most importantly, it would permit EPA to establish emission standards based on genuinely representative data from the industry. Second, if sufficient results are non -detect, it \nwould assist in  setting a work practice for D/F . Third, comprehensive data may show that \nsubcategories would be appropriate for lime plants emitting D/F, based on type of equipment or type of product being manufactured, as was the case for HCl . \n In the alternative, EPA\u2019s lack of adequate data should support the establishment of a \nwork practice for D/F , as described below . When EPA does not have sufficient HAP data to set a \nnumeric standard, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s promulgation of a non- numeric work \npractice standard. Chesapeake Climate Action Network v. EPA , 952 F.3d 310, 315 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n \nFinally, EPA should consider the alternative of setting no standard for D/F at all  as it did \nin 2004. EPA already established that D/F emissions from lime manufacturing processes are \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 58 negligible.34 Accordingly, such emissions are de minimis , and do not require an emissions \nstandard. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle , 636 F.2d 323, 400 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (describing EPA\u2019s \ndiscretion to exempt certain de minimis  releases from regulation under the Clean Air Act).  Such \na standard is clearly not \u201cnecessary\u201d under the terms of the LEAN  decision and the Clean Air \nAct. \n \nXX. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, EPA SHOULD SET T HE WORK PRACTICE \nSTANDARD FOR DIOXINS/FURANS  PROPOSED BY NLA  \n \nDuring the development of the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA repeatedly and \nconsistently informed NLA that it was planning to issue a work practice for dioxins and furans, \nbecause, according to EPA, it had D/F data showing that more than 55% of test results were non-detect, thus permitting EPA to establish a work practice. NLA and EPA had multiple discussions on the form a work practice would take, and NLA submitted a suggested work practice. See  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. NLA noted that due to the extremely low D/F \nemissions, an appropriate work practice would require sources to properly operate the air pollution control devices already in place to control particulate matter. However, in both the January 2023 Proposed Rule  and the new Proposed Rule , EPA proposed to set a MACT floor \nbased on data from a single lime kiln. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA requests  comment on a \npotential work practice. \n NLA continues to believe that EPA should apply the work practice previously submitted \nby NL A in EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. Considering that EPA has already \nfound that risks from dioxin and furan emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and that D/F emissions are extremely low, a practice requiring sources to properly maintain existing air pollution control devices is sufficient to ensure that risks from D/F emissions remain low.\n35 \n XXI. EPA SHOULD PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE METHOD FOR \nDIOXINS AND FURANS  \n \nNLA continues to believe that the work practice it previously suggested should be \nadopted by EPA. However, if EPA chooses not to provide a work practice, NLA suggests that EPA  set an alternative method of complying with the numerical standard by allowing an \nappropriate inlet temperature to the air pollution control device (APCD) to be set on a site -\n \n34 See EPA Docket No. A- 95-41, Item No.  II-B-121. (\u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners are well -\ndocumented but are shown to be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not \ncollected in this search.\u201d)  \n35 NLA has not included its suggested work practice language in the \u201cblueline,\u201d because EPA previously declined to \nadopt  this work practice. However, if EPA decides to include the work practice, the relevant rule language would \nstate that \u201c Lime kilns operators, as an indicator of good kiln operation, will comply with Lime MACT PMCD  \noperating requirements at all times. For lime kilns with a fabric filter (FF) or an electro -static precipitator (ESP) , \ncomply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements which serve to affirm good operating practices, and f or lime kilns with \na wet scrubber comply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements including continuous performance levels for flow and \npressure drop and flow rate which continuously assures good operation is occurring. \u201d \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 59 specific basis . This is due to the wide variety of gas temperatures entering the various APCD and \nthe variety of kiln/APCD configurations.36  \nThis approach is justified because compliance testing combined with a site -specific \ntemperature (i.e., inlet to APCD temperature) would ensure that each plant\u2019s configuration and \ntemperature parameters result in D/F emissions that meet the numeric standard. Compliance with the site -specific temperature should be on a 30-day rolling average. If annual compliance testing \nfor a period of three years shows the lime plant meets the numeric standard and the temperature requirement is met, then the lime plant shou ld be allowed to discontinue stack testing for D/F \nand show compliance through the parametric temperature requirement alone.  \nThis temperature -based approach would be a parametric way of implementing the 0.037 \nng/dscm standard. Therefore, the temperature-based approach is not a work practice, and measuring 0.037 with a stack test or measuring site -specific temperature would be alternative \nmeans of complying with the same numerical standard. (NLA would like to emphasize that this \napproach should only be set as an alternative means of compliance to periodic stack testing, and \nnot the sole means of compliance, because some lime plant s will be able to meet the numeric \nstandard without temperature control, and other plants may have to employ controls other than temperature controls to meet the numerical standard .) \nNLA suggests adding the following language to Table 6, Line 22: \nAs an alternative compliance method to the performance testing specified above, a source may \nperform annual testing for a period of three years  to establish a site -specific temperature of \ngases entering the inlet to the air pollution control device at which the numerical standard for dioxins/furans is met. Subsequently the source may rely on parametric temperature monitoring  \non a 30-day rolling average, and further performance testing is not required. \n \nXXII.  D/F\u2014REQUIRED TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nIf EPA chooses to promulgate a numerical emissions standard for dioxins and furans, the \nfollowing technical corrections should be made. \n \nA. EPA Has Properly  Corrected  the Proposed D/F E missions B ased on EPA\u2019s \nProposed D/F T esting R equirements.   \n In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed a limit on D/F based on EPA\u2019s \nJohnson memo.\n37 To properly utilize Reference Image 4 -3 to obtain a limit, the stack gas sample \nvolume, in dry standard cubic meter (dscm), is required to select the appropriate 3xRDL value. NLA pointed out in comments that EPA\u2019s proposed D/F limit was  set incorrectly in that it \n \n36 These variations are also the reason no temperature -based work practice has been identified that  would be \npracticable for the lime industry.  \n37 See Reference Image 4 -3: EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117. Memorandum from Steffan \nJohnson, USEPA Regarding Determination of \u201cnon- detect\u201d from EPA Method 29 (multi -metals) and EPA Method \n23 (dioxin/furan) test data when evaluating the setting of MACT floors versus establishing work practice standards , \nJune 5, 2014.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 60 improperly referenced a sample collection volume of 4 dscm (and not 3 dscm as  is included in \nthe rulemaking). EPA has recognized this issue and  has corrected the D/F limit to  0.037 ng/dscm  \nin the 2024 Proposed Rule . NLA commends EPA for this correction.  \n \nB. The TEF in Table 1 1 of the Proposed Rule  Redline  and EPA\u2019s 2010 TEF \nDocket D ocument D o Not M atch.   \n \nIn the preamble  to the new Proposed Rule , EPA states the following:  \n \nAdditionally, the EPA is incorporating by reference EPA/100/R \u2013 10/005, \n\u2018\u2018Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) for Human Health Risk \nAssessments of 2, 3, 7, 8 - Tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like Compounds,\u2019\u2019 \nDecember 2010, which is the s ource of the toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) for dioxins \nand furans used in calculating the toxic equivalence quotient of the proposed dioxin and furan standard.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9103.  \n \nTable 2 of the December 2010 document  referenced in the preamble provides the \nrecommended TEFs for D/F that are apparently incorporated by reference. However, Table 11 in  \nthe Proposed Rule  redline contains incorrect  TEF factors  from 1989. This disparity could create \nconfusion in future testing for D/F and should be corrected.\n \n \nAlso note that in the definitions section of the docket redline ( \u00a763.7143), the definition of \nTEQ refers to Table 10, when it should refer to Table 11.38 \n \nCOMMENTS ON MONITORING  \n \nAs noted above , NLA supports EPA\u2019s decision to base monitoring on periodic stack \ntesting and parametric monitoring. However, some adjustments to the proposed parametric \nmonitoring are needed.  \n XXIII.  EPA SHOULD MODIFY PARAMETRIC MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  \nFOR PERIODS OF STARTUP  AND SHUTDOWN  \nThe Proposed Rule  requires sources to comply with emissions  limits  and operating limits \nat all times , except during startup and shutdown as indicated in Table 2 of the docket redline . \nEven though NLA endorse s the use of periodic stack test and parametric monitoring to \ndemonstrate continuous compliance, the Proposed Rule  does not appropriately address how \noperating limits will be met during lime kiln startup or shutdown  for kilns using dry sorbent \ninjection , ACI or thermal oxidizers . During these periods, sorbent and carbon cannot be injected \nat the same rates as during normal operations , and operating conditions for RTOs differ as well . \n \n \n38 Note that if Table 9, referring to emissions averaging, is deleted as NLA suggests, the TEQ table would again be \nTable 10.  EPA should make sure the definition reference is consistent with the table number.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 61 NLA requests that EPA add the following (new) language to Table 2  to address \napplicable operating limits in the Proposed Rule s during startup and shutdown. \n \n5. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use dry \nsorbent injection or carbon injection during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 operating limits for sorbent and/or carbon injection do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that sorbent or carbon injection is in operation until the uni t is no \nlonger in startup or shutdown. During startup and shutdown, the control device shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating \nprocedure for startup and shutdown events. \n \n6. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use a thermal oxidizer during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 temperature limits for a thermal oxidizer do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that the thermal oxidizer is in operation until the unit is no longer in startup or shutdown.\n During startup and shutdown, the control \ndevice shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating procedure for \nstartup and shutdown events. \n \n \nXXIV.  EPA SHOULD PERMIT USE OF APPROVED MONITORING APPROACHES (SUCH AS BAG LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS ) DURING STARTUP AND \nSHUTDOWN  \n In the 2020 Lime MACT RTR rulemaking, EPA incorporated new requirements for \nstartup and shutdown of kilns as it related to existing visible emissions standards  for PM . \nHowever, the final rulemaking did not specify how kilns already using approved monitoring systems other than continuous opacity monitoring systems  (COMS ), such as bag leak detection \nsystems (BLDS), during normal operations should comply during startup and shutdown events.  \n \nKilns in the lime industry have used BLDS  (and other approved methods)  for continuous \ncompliance standards under the Lime MACT since its original inception in lieu of COMS. EPA, however, in several  instances, has disapproved applications for Alternative Monitoring \napproaches  proposing that a BLDS, like a COM, be allowed during s tartup/ shutdown events. \nEPA should clarify this issue now and should make it clear that a n approved method such as \nBLDS may be used during s tartup/ shutdown events as they are allowed for use under normal \noperation. Therefore, NLA request s that  the following provision be added to \u00a763.7090(c) of the \nregulation to clearly authorize use of these methods  during s tartup/ shutdown events : \n \nWhen a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown, a lime kiln may use any method approved for use \nto show continuous compliance during normal operations (such as a bag leak detection system) to demonstrate proper operation of the baghouse as a surrogate to demonstrating compliance with visible emission limits during these events.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 62 XXV.  EPA SHOULD ADJUST LANGUAGE IN \u00a763.7113 \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (h)(2) and (3) of the redline, EPA, in reference to monitors used to measure \ninjection rates, states that the device should be installed and calibrated \u201cin accordance with the \nmanufacturer's procedures and specifications.\u201d In some cases, manufacturers\u2019 procedures and specifications are unavailable or out of date, or  are otherwise incomplete or inapplicable. NLA \nrequests that EPA add the phrase \u201cor other applicable procedures  (such as industry standards or \nbest practices)  to ensure proper operation of the  device. \u201d \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (i)(3), EPA states that \u201c The calibration reference for the temperature \nmeasurement must be a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated reference \nthermocouple -potentiometer system or alternate reference, subject to approval by the \nAdministrator .\u201d NLA notes that it would be preferable for this section to call for  the \nmeasurement to be \u201ccalibrated to a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable \ncertified reference thermocouple,\u201d because such traceable certified reference thermocouples are more readily available.  \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (4), the term \u201cand other temperature sensors\u201d should be deleted. NLA is not \naware of temperature sensors other than thermocouples in use in this application. \n \nXXVI.  EPA SHOULD ADD CLARFYING LANGUAGE TO \u00a763.711 2(d) \n \nIn \u00a763.7112(d) , EPA adds language on test runs for performance tests. NLA believes that \nthe language on test duration could cause some confusion, and recommends that EPA revise the \nlast sentence in the section to read \u201cEach test run must last at least 1 hour for PM testing or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM.\u201d Alternatively, EPA could incorporate the 1 hour test run requirement for PM testing into Table 5 (as with the duration \nrequirement for other HAPs), and simply revise the language in (d) to \u201cThe duration of each test run shall be as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.\u201d  \n \nADDITIONAL COMMENTS  AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nXXVII.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT THE EQUATION FOR CALCULATING HCl \nAND MERCURY LBS/TON OF LIME PRODUCED EMISSION RATES  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposed redline text includes Equation 4 in Section 63.7112(n) to calculate the \nHCl and Hg emission rates in pounds  per ton of lime produced for HCl and pounds  per million \ntons of lime produced for Hg.  The equation is  stated in the redline  as follows : \n \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58+ \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)\n\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c   where,  \n \nE = Emission rate of mercury, pounds per million tons (lb/MMton) of lime produced or \nHCl per ton (lb/ton) of lime produced  \n Ck = Concentration in the kiln effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd)  \n Qk = Volumetric flow rate of kiln gas effluent (dscf/hr)  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 63 Qc = Volumetric flow rate of cooler effluent gas, dscf/hr. This value is zero if there is not \na separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nCc = Concentration in the cooler effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd).  This \nvalue is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nP = Stone production rate (ton/hr) for HCl and (MMton/hr) for Hg. K = Conversion factor, for mercury 2.2 x 10\n-9 \u00b5g/lb.  For HCl 9.20 x 10-8 ppmvd HCl per \nlb/dscf HCl.  \n Careful review of this equation  has determined that the conversion factor units for HCl and \nmercury are incorrect.  Also, as noted in section IX above, calculation of HAP emission rates \nfrom coolers other than PM is unnecessary and should be deleted. Therefore, t o calculate the \ncorrect emission rate, the follow revisions should be made to the equation: \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38=  \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc72(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58)\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c    where,  \nK = Conversion factor \nMercury conversion factor = 2.2 x 10-9 lb/\u00b5g . \nHCl conversion factor = 9.20 x 10-8 lb/dscf HCl per ppmvd HCl . \nOther terms are as defined above. \n The corrected equation  includes K in the numerator, not the denominator, emissions rate \ncalculations from coolers have been dropped, and conversion factor units have been corrected. \nEPA should update equation 4 accordingly. Note: If EPA sets an HBEL for HCl, this formula \nwould not be necessary for HCl, and would apply only to mercury.  \n \nXXVIII.  EPA SHOULD PROVIDE THAT TESTING TO RESET OPERATING \nLIMITS DOES NOT VIOLATE STANDARDS   \n \nThe Proposed Rule states that operating limits must be complied with at all times  (except \nto a limited extent  during startup and shutdown). However, operators when seeking to reset \noperating limits require the ability to reset at the appropriate level at the time of the test, which \nmay be at a different  level than the prior operating limit. The rule should clarify that a source is \nallowed to deviate from an existing operating limit when conducting a subsequent engineering evaluation or performance test. The rule should include the following language in \u00a763.7100 (a), and in  the definition of \u201cDeviation\u201d in 63.7143: \n \nHowever, when a lime kiln emissions control device is being evaluated for engineering \npurposes or for performance testing purposes, the existing operating limits for the control device do not apply and variance from current operating limits is not a deviation. \n \n \nXXIX.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT LANGUAGE REFERRING TO SCRUBBERS  \n \nThe Proposed Rule misconstrues the difference between a PM (typically venturi) type \nscrubber and a WPTGA used to control acid gases which a lime kiln may need to install to \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 64 comply with the new requirements of this rulemaking. This apparently led EPA to erroneously \ndelete some references to PM in the rule language, when those references are intended to make \nclear that the provisions refer to scrubbers used to control PM. EPA should clarify the Proposed \nRule  by retaining all references to PM scrubbers in the existing rule language  and ensure that \nreferences to setting parameter limits for PM scrubbers or acid gas scrubbers explicitly state that establishing operating parameters only apply when conducting performance tests for the specific \npollutant being measured.  \n \nFor example, in Table 5, lines 8, 9, 14, and 15, deleting the scrubber flow rate reference \nto PM could imply that the PM scrubber flow rate requirement is to be reset for a performance \ntest of any regulated HAP in the rule when it should only apply when completing a PM limit \nperformance test.  The same is the case for Table 3 lines 2 and 4, and Table 6 lines 1 and 3. The \nreference to PM should be retained in each of those provisions . \n \nXXX.  IN TABLE 5, ROW 6, THERE IS A REFER ENC E \u201cREFER TO NOTE 1\u201d THAT \nAPPEARS TO BE INCORRECT  \n \nRow  6 on Table 5 (addressing PM) in the docket redline includes, in the third column, the \nreference \u201cRefer to Note 1.\u201d Note 1 , however, relates to utilizing ASTM D6384- 12e1 for HCl \nand organic testing  and does not appear to be relevant to Row 6. The reference in Row 6 should \nbe corrected or deleted.  \n \nXXXI.  EPA SHOULD SIMPLIFY THE DEFINTION OF DRY SORBENT INJECTION \n \nThe definition of dry sorbent injection in \u00a763.7143 refers to use of this technology \u201c to \nreact with and neutralize acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl), Hg, organic HAP, or dioxin furans .\u201d \nNLA believes that this language should be simplified to refer only to HAPs being regulated in this rule, and thus should read \u201c\u201dto react with and neutralize HCl, Hg, organic HAP, or dioxins and furans.\u201d  \n \nXXXII.  EPA SHOULD REVISE TABLE S 3, 4 AND 6 TO INCLUDE PARALLEL \nLANGUAGE ON REQUIREMENTS  AND TO CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS.  \n \nLine 7 of Table 3 in the redline  should be revised to require \u201c flow rate greater than or \nequal to the flow rate operating limit,\u201d to parallel similar language in Line 8.  \n Table 3, Lines 7 and 8 should be revised to add the words \u201c for the applicable pollutant\u201d \nto the end to reflect  that not all pollutants will necessarily be tested in each performance test.  \nSimilarly, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should be added to Table 4, Line 1, before the term \u201cperformance test.\u201d In Table 6, Lines 7 and 8, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should also be added before \nthe term \u201cperformance test.\u201d (These suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cblueline.\u201d)  \n \nXXXIII.  TABLE 5 SHOULD BE REVISED FOR CLARITY \n \nTable 5, Line 20, should be revised to make clear that there are different required test \ndurations for different test methods . See the NLA blueline for suggested language.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 65  \nXXXIV.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT A TYPO IN TABLE 4  \n \nTable 4, Line  1 refers to measuring mercury using \u201cMethod 29 or 30B 5D in appendix A \nto part 60\u201d and measuring Total Organic HAP \u201cusing Method 18 5D in appendix A to part 60\u201d.  \nIn both cases the use of 5D appears to be a typographical error and should be deleted. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nNLA appreciates the opportunity to comment on these important issues.   \nVery truly yours,  \n \n William C.

Beginning [DATE OF  PUBLICATION \nOF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], each performance test must include \nthe methods specified in rows 19-24 of Table 5 to this subpart . Performance tests for the \nemission standards promulgated in this rule , including PM emission standards and emissions \nstandards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at the same time.  On and after the relevant \ncompliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), each performance test must be \nconducted based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating \nconditions) of the affected source and under the specific conditions in Table 5 to this subpart. \nRepresentative conditions exclude periods of sta rtup and shutdown. The owner or operator may not  \nconduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator  must  record the process \ninformation that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include  in such record  \nan explanation to support that such conditions represent  normal operation. Upon request, the owner or \noperator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the \nconditions of performance tests. \n(c) Prior to the relevant compliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), you \nmay not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as \nspecified  in \u00a763.7(e)(1).

Each  test run must last \nat least 1 hour for PM testing  or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM . \n13  \n \n (e) The emission rate of particulate matter (PM) from each lime kiln (and each lime cooler \nif there is a separate exhaust  to the atmosphere  from  the lime cooler)  must  be computed for each \nrun using Equation 1 of this section:  \n \nWhere:  \nE = Emission rate  of PM, pounds  per ton (lb/ton)  of stone feed.  \nCk = Concentration of  PM in  the kiln effluent, grain/dry standard  cubic  feet (gr/dscf).  \nQk = Volumetric  flow  rate of  kiln effluent  gas, dry standard  cubic feet  per hour (dscf/hr).  \n \nCc = Concentration of PM in the cooler  effluent,  grain/dscf. This value  is zero  if there  is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n \nQc = Volumetric  flow rate of cooler  effluent  gas, dscf/hr.  This value  is zero if there is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n P = Stone  feed rate,  tons  per hour (ton/hr).  \n \nK = Conversion factor, 7000 grains  per pound (grains/lb).  \n \n(f)(1) If you choose to meet a weighted average emission limit as specified in item 4 of \nTable 1 to this subpart, you must  calculate a combined particulate  emission  rate from  all kilns \nand coolers within your LMP using Equation 2 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \n \nET = Emission rate  of PM from  all kilns and coolers,  lb/ton of  stone feed.  \nEi = Emission  rate of PM from  kiln i, or from  kiln/cooler  combination i, lb/ton of stone  feed. \nPi = Stone feed rate to kiln i, ton/hr.  \nn = Number of  kilns you wish to  include  in averaging. \n \n(2) You do not have  to include  every  kiln in this calculation,  only include  kilns  you wish  to \n\n14  \n \n average. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(g) The weighted  average PM emission  limit from  all kilns  and coolers  for which  you are \naveraging must be calculated using Equation 3 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \nETN = Weighted  average PM  emission  limit  for all kilns  and coolers  being included in averaging \nat the LMP, lb/ton of stone feed.  \nEj = PM emission  limit (0.10 or 0.12)  for kiln j, or for kiln/cooler  combination j, lb/ton  of stone \nfeed.  \nPj = Stone  feed rate to  kiln j, ton/hr.  \nm = Number of kilns and kiln/cooler combinations you are averaging at your LMP. You must \ninclude  the same kilns  in the calculation  of ET and ETN. Kilns  that have  a PM emission \nlimit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(h) Performance  test results  must  be documented in complete  test reports  that contain  the \ninformation required by paragraphs (h)(1) through (10) of this section, as well as all other \nrelevant information. The plan to be followed during testing must be made available to the Administrator at least 60 days prior to testing.  \n(1) A brief  description of  the process  and the  air pollution  control system;  \n(2) Sampling  location  description(s);  \n \n(3) A description of sampling  and analytical  procedures  and any modifications  to standard \nprocedures;  \n(4) Test results, including opacity;  \n \n(5) Quality  assurance procedures  and results;  \n \n(6) Records  of operating conditions  during the test, preparation  of standards,  and calibration \n\n15  \n \n procedures;  \n(7) Raw data sheets  for field  sampling  and field  and laboratory analyses;  \n \n(8) Documentation of calculations;  \n \n(9) All data recorded and  used to establish operating limits; and  \n \n(10) Any other information  required by the test method. \n \n(i) [Reserved]  \n \n(j) You must establish any applicable 3-hour block average operating limit indicated in \nTable 3 to this subpart according  to the applicable requirements  in Table 4  to this subpart and \nparagraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section. \n(1) Continuously record  the parameter  during the PM performance  test and include the  \n \nparameter  record(s) in the performance test report.  \n \n(2) Determine  the average  parameter  value for  each 15 -minute  period of each test  run. \n \n(3) Calculate the test run average for the parameter  by taking the average of all  the 15- \nminute parameter values for the run. \n(4) Calculate the 3-hour operating limit by taking the average of the three test  run averages.  \n \n(k) For each building enclosing any PSH operations that is subject  to a VE limit,  you must \nconduct a VE check according to item 18 in Table 5 to this subpart, and in accordance with \nparagraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. \n(1) Conduct visual inspections that consist of a visual survey of the building over the test \nperiod to identify if there are VE, other than condensed water vapor. \n(2) Select  a position at least 15 but not more  1,320 feet from  each  side of the building with \nthe sun or other light source generally at your back. \n(3) The observer conducting the VE checks  need  not be certified  to conduct EPA  Method 9 \nin appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter. However, the observer must meet the training \n16  \n \n requirements as described in EPA Method 22 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. \n(l) When  determining  compliance with the opacity standards for fugitive emissions  from \nPSH operations in item 8 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct EPA Method 9 in \nappendix A-4 to  part 60 of this  chapter  according  to item 17 in  Table 5 to  this subpart, and  in \naccordance with paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section.  \n(1) The minimum distance between  the observer  and the emission  source shall  be 4.57 \nmeters (15 feet).  \n(2) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from \nother fugitive emission  sources  (e.g., road  dust). The required  observer position  relative  to the \nsun must be followed. \n(3) If you use wet dust suppression to control PM from PSH operations, a visible mist is \nsometimes  generated  by the spray. The  water  mist must not be confused with  particulate  matter \nemissions  and is not to be considered VE. When  a water  mist of this nature is present,  you must \nobserve emissions at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible. \n(m) On and after the relevant  compliance date for your source as specified  in \u00a763.7083( eg), \nduring startup, kilns must  be tested hourly to determine when lime product meets the definition \nof on-specification lime product. \n(n) An LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all  lime kilns is \nbelow 300 tpy and submit this with a  Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS)  before the \ncompliance date. The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test \non each lime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of pound per ton of lime produced multiplied by annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl for all kilns at the site. If the LMP includes any kilns requiring add-on controls to comply with the HBEL, the operator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating \n17  \n \n parameter for other controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain \ncompliance with the HBEL. In this case, the LMP operator will submit documentation of the operating rate for DSI on units with controls, as applicable, and a compliance demonstration annually indicating actual emissions in the prior calendar year do not exceed 300 tpy. \u00b7 Alternatively, the facility may seek a practically enforceable permit provision from the LMP\u2019s local air permitting authority that limits HCl to no more than 300 tpy. The LMP shall also \ncertify in a NOCS, by relying on the most recent HCl performance test data for each kiln, that the sum of the hourly emissions rate (i.e., the sum of 3- run averages for each kiln at the site) is \nno greater than 685 lb/hr. \n(o) The emission  rate of mercury  and hydrochloric acid  (HCl ) from  each lime  kiln (and  each \nlime cooler as applicable)  must be computed for each run using Equation 4 of this section:2 \n Delete incorrect equation:  \n \n \n Add c orrect equation : \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhere:  \nE = Emission  rate of mercury,  pounds per million  tons (lb/MMton) of lime produced or HCl \npounds per ton (lb/ton) of lime produced. \nCk = Concentration in the kiln effluent  of mercury,  micrograms/dry  standard cubic feet (\u00b5g/dscf ) \n \n2 Equation 4 will only apply to calculating  mercury emission rates if a HBEL  for HCl is established .

The exhaust  may be \nan open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.  \nOn-specification  Lime  Product  means  lime product  that has been  sufficiently  calcined  to \nmeet end use requirements.  \nParticulate  matter  (PM) detector  means  a system  that is continuously capable of monitoring \nPM loading in the exhaust of FF or ESP in order to detect bag leaks, upset conditions, or control device malfunctions and sounds an alarm at a  preset level. A PM detector system includes, but is \nnot limited  to, an  instrument  that operates  on triboelectric,  light  scattering,  light  transmittance,  or \nother effects to continuously monitor relative particulate loadings. A BLDS is a type of PM detector.  \n52  \n \n Positive  pressure  FF or ESP  means  a FF or ESP with  the fan(s) on the upstream  side of the \ncontrol device. \nProcess stone handling operations means the equipment and transfer points between the \nequipment used to transport processed stone, and includes, storage bins, conveying system \ntransfer  points, bulk loading or unloading systems,  screening  operations, bucket elevators,  and \nbelt conveyors. \nProcessed  stone means  limestone  or other calcareous  material  that has been  processed  to a \nsize suitable for feeding into a lime kiln.  \nScreening operation means a device for separating material according to size by passing \nundersize material  through one or more  mesh  surfaces  (screens)  in series  and retaining  oversize \nmaterial on the mesh surfaces (screens).  \nShutdown means  the cessation  of kiln operation. Shutdown begins when  feed to the kiln is \nreduced below planned production quantities and ends when stone feed is halted and fuel \ncombustion from the main burner ceases. \nStack emissions means  the PM that is released  to the atmosphere from  a capture system  or \ncontrol device. \nStartup means  the beginning of kiln operation. Startup  begins when  a shutdown kiln begins \nfiring fuel in the main burner. Startup ends when the lime kiln first generates on- specification \nlime product or 12 hours following first discharge from the kiln, whichever is earlier. \nStone produced refers  to the production of limestone  from  the lime kiln consisting of high- \ncalcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \nStorage bin means  a manmade enclosure for storage (including surge bins) of processed \nstone prior to the lime kiln.  \nTEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity equivalents for dioxins and \n53  \n \n furans as defined in EPA/100/R-10/005, \u201c Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) \nfor Human Health Risk Assessments of 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like \nCompounds \u201d, December  2010 (incorporated by reference\u2014see  \u00a763.14). The Toxic Equivalency \nFactors (TEFs) used to determine the dioxin and furan TEQs are listed in Table 10 of this \nsubpart.  \nTotal Organic HAP  means,  for the purposes of this subpart, the sum of the concentrations of \ncompounds of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, and naphthalene as measured by EPA Test Method 320 or Method 18 of appendix A to this part or ASTM D6348\u201303[1] or a combination of these methods, as appropriate. If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection  \nlevel (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), a value of zero (0) should be used you must use the \nmethod detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total \norganic HAP value. The measured  result  for a multiple  component analysis  (e.g., analytical  \nvalues  for multiple  Method 18 fractions) may include a combination of method detection level \ndata and analytical data reported above th e method detection level. The owner or operator of an \naffected source may request the use of other test methods to make this determination under paragraphs 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f) of this part.  \nTransfer point means  a point in a conveying operation where the material  is transferred  to \nor from a belt conveyor. \nVent means an opening through which there is mechanically induced air flow for the \npurpose of exhausting from  a building air carrying  PM emissions  from  one or more  emission \nunits. \n \n54  \n \n Table 1 to  Subpart  AAAAA of Part  63\u2014Emission Limits  \nAs required  in \u00a763.7090(a), you must meet  each emission  limit in the following  table  that \napplies to you, except for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown (See Table 2 for \nemission limits for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown). \n \nFor . . .

If, at  any time \nafter January 5, 2004, the kiln changes to a dry control \nsystem, then the PM emission limit in item 1 of this \nTable  1 applies,  and the kiln is hereafter  ineligible  for the \nPM emission limit in item 2 of this Table 1 regardless of \nthe method of PM control.  \n3. All nNew lime kilns and their \nassociated lime coolers  PM emissions  must  not exceed  0.10 lb/tsf.  \n4.

It is found in household products such as \ncleaners and swimming pool additives and is formed during the burning of many plastics.  HCl is \nconsidered one of the most important ba sic industrial chemicals.  Mean air exposure to HCl in \noccupational settings has been estimated by IARC as ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 \nduring acid treatment of metals , while m ean exposures during other industrial processes are \nestimated as >1 mg/m3. Ambient air levels of HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3. \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulf uric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl was that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore assessed \nexposure to HCl as not classifiable as to it s carcinogenicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d).  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that \nmany individua ls classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that \nincluded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  When exposures are mixed, \nthe substance contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome  (e.g., \nsulfuric acid in mixed acid mists) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. Mixed \nexposures or chance are the likely explanation s for the sporadic  positive associations with cancer \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containin g HCl.  All occupational epidemiology \nstudies published since the 1992 IARC  determination are consistent with this conclusion.  \nThe available toxicological evidence also is consistent with the human data, i.e., it does not \nindicate that HCl is carcinogenic or mutagenic, and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types \nof cell proliferation that are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens . The only chronic \nexposure study  reported increased  incidence of  hyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferatio n) in the \nlarynx and trachea of rats exposed to 10 ppm HCl as compared to controls , but no excess cancer \nwas observed.  Hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure \nconcentrations below the threshold at which hyperplasia was reported. Two  short term cancer \nstudies in experimental animals reported that neither dermal nor oral exposures resulted in an \nincrease in cancers.  The available toxicology studies also did not provide evidence of genotoxicity \nor mutagenicity resulting fro m HCl exposures (as reviewed by Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development). Furthermore, in studies where HCl was administered along with \nformaldehyde, exposures to 10 ppm HCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d \nthe carcinoge nicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n2 HCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n1.INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (i.e., it is an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. The gas form may be designated as \nHCl(g) , and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air   (IARC 1992; ATSDR 2014; National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for \nBiotechnology Information 2024; ATSDR 2002) . On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white \nvapors due to condensation with atmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into \ncontact with moisture, it forms hydrochloric acid. Commercial concentrated hydrochloric acid  \ncontains 36% to 38% hydrogen chloride in water.  \nIn the early twentieth century, hydrogen chloride was created by burning hydrogen gas. This \nmethod created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between chloride salts and \nsulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC 1992) . A widely used industrial chemical,  HCl can \nalso be formed as a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in industrial manufacturing \nprocesses, for e xample from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime (CaO and MgO)  (IARC 1992; \nATSDR 2014; ATSDR 2002) . HCl can also  be found in many everyday products, including \nhousehold products such as cleaners and swimming pool additives (used to adjust the pH), and it \nis formed during the burning of many plastics.  Industrial uses of HCl include pickling, \nelectroplating metals, tanni ng leather, cleaning, and the production of a wide variety of products . \nHCl is also formed naturally in events like volcano eruptions. HCl is one of the most widely used \nchemicals in industrial processes , and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA ) estimates that about 1,239,000 American workers are potentially exposed to HCl (as \ncited in IARC 1992) . People are exposed to HCl in the ambient air , although concentrations  are \ntypically below 0.01 mg/m3 (as cited in IARC 1992) . \nBased on communication wit h the National Lime Association (personal communication), HCl \nemitted from lime kilns controlled with a dry air pollution control device (APCD) is in the vapor \n(gas) phase. This is because the gas exit temperature (~400 degrees F) is well above any \nthresho ld where acid mist could exist 0F1. This has been verified with industry stack test data \nobtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing, which confirm the presence of HCl as a \ngas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are controlled with dry \nAPCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions in the form of mists are expected \nto be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water.  \n1.2 Residual Risk , Technology Review , and Health -Based Exposure Limits  \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US -EPA) regulates \n1 As we discuss later, the carcinogenicity evidence for acids involves acid mists specifically . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n3 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022In the first  stage,  section 112(d) requires the US-EPA to develop technology -based\nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each\ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) . 1F2\n\u2022In the second stage, US-EPA is required under section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and\nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If\nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of\nsafety or to prevent an adverse environmental effect, US-EPA must develop  standards to\naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as\nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US-EPA issued MACT\nstandards, the residual risk stage must be completed within eight years of promulgation\nof the  initial technology -based standard .\nUnder section 112(d)(6), US-EPA also must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight yea rs and revise them, as necessary, taking into account developments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US-EPA will revise the rule s. For efficiency, the US-EPA includ es the \n112(f) and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory package and calls the rulemakings the Risk \nand Technology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US-EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is ba sed on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emi ssions information).\u201d  \nAs outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based \nthreshold, assuming such a threshold has been established. The US-EPA will not approve a \nhealth -based threshold for a MACT standard if a HAP is a  carcinogen.  As part of the statutory \nlime manufacturing risk and technology review, US-EPA conducted an inhalation risk assessment \nfor HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and found no unacceptable human health risk \nunder worst case emissions scen arios ( 84 FR 48,723 (Sep. 16, 2019) ). The US-EPA risk \nassessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a variety of human -health risk \nscreening benchmarks as part of risk calculations.  \nIn its pre -proposed rule announced in the February 9, 2024 Federal Register (Vol 89, No. 28), \nUS-EPA requested public comment on a potential health -based exposure limit (HBEL) for HCl. To \nregulate  exposure levels using an HBEL, the chemical in question must be identified as a non -\ncarcinogen . The specific scientific issues that the National Lime Association requested Ramboll to \nconsider are as follows:  \n1.Evidence  related to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl .\n2.Whether  the scientific community has judged there to be an established threshold for\nhealth effects  associated with HCl exposure .\n3.The estimated margin of safety associated with the proposed threshold .\n2 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n4 2.METHODS\n2.1 General a pproach  \nRambo ll review ed and synthesize d the scientific literature regarding the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nand provided a report to NLA in June 2021 . Our 2021 assessment of HCl carcinogenicity \nincorporated previous assessments by  the World Health Organization Internationa l Agency for \nResearch on Cancer ( IARC), the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n(OECD ), and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) that we updated with \ninformation identified through literature search es to identify information available after the \npublication dates for those agency reports . We concluded that the newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence , and, t aking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  As a follow -up to \nRamboll\u2019s June 2021 report, Ramboll has undertaken the following activities:  \n1.To comment on the evidence related to  the potential for HCl to be a carcinogen,  we\nconducted new searches of the literature to identify any assessments of the risks\nassociated with HCl exposure that had been conducted by authoritative bodies  or that\nhad been published in individual research s tudies since January 2021. This time interval\ndeliberately overlaps with the period covered in Ramboll\u2019s previous review, in order to\nidentify material published in early 2021 whose indexing had been delayed.  We reviewed\nall new information to determine if  it provided evidence in conflict with our prior\nconclusions, or if it supported our prior conclusions.\n2.After incorporating new information into our prior assessment of the evidence, we\nabstracted all quantitative exposure data we identified to date  (i.e., including sources\nidentified for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report)  to determine if there was evidence for a threshold\nbelow which health effects were not observed  (no observed adverse effect level\n[NOAEL ]/lowest observed adverse effect level [LOAEL]). We documented this\ninformation, along with any specific health -related  outcomes investigated in association\nwith these exposure levels.\n3.We developed comments on the quality, quantity, and certainty of the evid ence thus\nsummarized , and discussed the ability to consider the conclusions  regarding a threshold\nfor health effects to be \u201cestablished\u201d .\n4.To comment on the estimated margin of safety in US -EPA\u2019s pre -proposed rule, we\nreview ed US-EPA air modeling methods to  verify the ir methods and underlying\nassumptions were scientifically supported . In addition, we r eviewed the calculations and\nassumptions underlying the reference concentration values (RfC) estimated by California\nEPA and US -EPA to determine which  approach  was more appropriate .\n2.2 Identifying Relevant Literature \nWe implemented the same search strategies documented in Ramboll\u2019s  June 2021 report to NLA \nto verify that we were able to identify the same body of relevant literature cited in 2021 and to \nupdate those searches with material published between 2021 and February 2024. We enhanced \nboth literature search es as described in section 2.2.2  and 2.2.3, below .  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n5 2.2.1  Updated assessments of HCl by authoritative bodies  \nWe checked for HCl assessments by the following authoritative bodies , focusing on material \npublished since 2021 : IARC, OECD, IPCS , the US Environmental Protection Agency ( US-EPA), the \nNational Toxicology Program (NTP), the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  \n(ATSDR),  The California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Environmental  Health \nHazard Assessment  (OEHHA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), The European Food Safety \nAuthority (EFSA), and the National Institute of Health (NIH) .  \n2.2.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature  \nTo identify studies of humans with potential occupational exposure to HCl, w e searched PubMed , \nusing  combinations of the following search terms: \u201coccupational\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \n\u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \n\u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -control\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d , clinical studies \nwere filtered out of the search to remove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s. We additionally \nsearched for epidemiology studies published since 2021 that had cited any of the literature \nreferenced in the IARC and OECD assessments that were the initial basis of Ramboll\u2019s 2021 \nreport.  \n2.2.3  Targeted PubMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nTo identify relevant toxicological data, including animal studies and studies of mutagenicity, we \nsearched PubMed  using combinations of the following search t erms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \n\u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201cchronic bioassay\u201d; and \u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d . To enhance our searches of \nthe toxicological literature, we included the terms \"cancer\", \"carcinogenicity\", and \"malignant\" \ncombined with the chemical names , and we also constructed searches combining  the chemical \nnames with the terms \"genotoxicity\" , \"mutagenicity\" , \"hyperplasia\" , and \"cell proliferation\" . \n2.2.4  Exclusion criteria  \nWe excluded p ublications  at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed in \nthe study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the test material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxi city study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3.RESULTS\n3.1 Evidence related to the p otential carcinogenicity of HCl  \n3.1.1  Restatement of previous conclusions  \nIn our 2021 report to NLA, Ramboll concluded there was no evid ence for HCl to be a carcinogen  \nbased on a review of the assessments conducted by IARC, OECD , and ICPS and incorporating \ninformation we identified in publications post -dating those assessments . Our 2021 evaluation of \nthe evidence  included  investigations of potential cancer associations  based on occupational \nepidemiology studies, and supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity studies and studies \nthat assessed the potential for HCl to induce cell proliferation.   \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n6 The occupational epidemiology studies (summarized in Table A1, Appendix A ) were \nmethodologically limited by their exposure assessment and categorization methods  that likely \nresulted in exposures that combined HCl with other industrial chemicals . The use of mixed \nexposure groups is particularly  germane, as the mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other \nstrong inorganic acid mists, which are classified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl \nand these other acids, any apparent association between HCl and cancer would be inflated due t o \nthe carcinogenic effect of exposure to the other acids. In spite of this confounding by mixed \nexposures, the results did not suggest an association  with cancer.  \nThe occupational epidemiology studies were also generally limited by inadequate control for \npotentially confounding , non-occupational  exposures, and small numbers of cases  that led to low \nstatistical power . Based on our assessment of the available evidence, Ramboll agreed with the \noverall conclusion by IARC that the small number of cancer cases ob served in various \noccupational cohorts likely represent sporadic cases and/or cases due to co-exposure by probable \nor known carcinogens , such as sulfuric and other  acid mists. \nThe genotoxicity studies  included in Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report  either indicat ed no genotoxic effect of \nHCl, or their results were deemed due to the acidic conditions of the experiments; the \nconcentrations of HCl that produced positive findings in these studies were higher than would be \nfound in the environment and are not relevant for the ambient air exposures that are the subject \nof the proposed HBEL.  Furthermore, w e did not find evidence that cell proliferation \u2013 which is \nsometimes involved  in the cancer process \u2013 is associated with  HCl exposure in in vitro  \ngenotoxicity  tests.  \n3.1.2  New literature : evidence related to the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nWe did not find any relevant toxicology studies nor additional analyses published by authoritative \nbodies that were missing from Ramboll\u2019s 2021 rep ort or that had been published since 2021.  \nWe identified three occupational epidemiology studies  published in 2021 or later.  Chen et al. \n(2021)  conducted a case -control study in south ern China based on self-reported data collected \nthrough in-person or telephone inte rviews.  The study comprised 2,514  cases and 2,586 c ontrols \nmatched on age, sex, and location.  Participants reported on work and health history and history \nof exposure to pot entially confounding factors . All exposures  to acid s and alkalis were grouped \ntogether , thereby introducing confounding of any potential HCl association by exposure to known \ncarcinogens.  The main analysis, which adjusted for potential confounders including  occupational \nexposure to other carcinogens,  provided an elevated risk estimate for nasopharyngeal cancers \n(odds ratio  (OR): 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30, 1.89) . A sub -analysis that focused on \nparticipants  categorized as ever or never exposed to sulfuric, hydrochloric and/or nitric acids \nadjusted for history of Epstein Barr virus infection  provided  an estimated OR for nasopharyngeal \ncancers of 1. 63 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.09) . Both estimates  are very likely driven by the co-expos ures \nto other acids that are classified as probable or known carcinogens . \nIn a study of 10,229  telecommunications workers (9,551 men) exposed to mixed acid mists, Ker \net al. (2021)  identified 52 deaths due to cancers of various types  (31 cancers of the digestive \nsystem, 7 lung cancers, 5 nasopharyngeal cancers, and 9 miscellaneous cancers: 3 leukemias, 1 \ncervical cancer, 1 urinary cancer, 1 thyroid cancer, 1 non -pancreatic endocrine cancer, 1 \nimmunological cancer, and 1 not specified) . Note that cancer is not one disease - different types \nof cancers have different causes (American Cancer Society 2022) . Standardized mortality ratios \n(SMR) estimated the risk  of each type of cancer observed in the study population compared with \nthe genera l population of Taiwan, where the study was conducted. All of the telecommunications \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n7 workers included in this study were exposed to mixed acids  that had been previously designated \nas probable or known  human carcinogens (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, ni tric acid ). After \ncontrolling for age, sex, and calendar year , there was no evidence of an increased risk of \nnasopharyngeal cancer  or lung cancer in the occupational cohort compared with the general \npopulation (i.e., SMR s adjusted for a five -year latency i nterval were 1.05 (p>0.99) and 0.76 \n(p=0.59), respectively ). There were some types of cancers with SMRs greater than one, but each \nhad only one to three  cases and none of these associations were statistically significant; these \nare likely to represent chance findings.  \n Moayedi -Nia et al.(2022)  published a case -control study of lung cancer nested in the Canad ian \nCARTaGENE cohort . The authors identified 147 lung cancer cases diagnosed between 20 09 and \n2016 and compared their exposure histories to the exposures reported by 1,032 non-cancer \ncontrols  based on the longest job held . Data were collected through telephone interviews and \nevaluated using CANJEM, the Canadian Job Exposure Matrix , to identify those who had no chance \nof exposure  (never exposed) , up to 25% certain ty of exposure  (ever) , and at least 25% certain ty \nof exposure (ever) to HCl based on job categor ies. After adjusting for age , smoking status, \nenvironmental tobacco smoke exp osure, family history, and ever/never exposure to all other \noccupational lung carcinogens  identified through CANJEM , participants ever occupationally \nexposed to HCl with at least 25% certainty had a n OR of 3.79 (95% CI 1.07 \u2013 13.41) for lung \ncancer compared to unexposed subjects , based on only five exposed  cases  (2 women and 3 \nmen) . The association was no longer statistically significant a fter adjustment for multiple \ncomparisons  to account for the many different potential health outcomes included in this \nanalysis , suggesting it may have been  a chance finding. There were too few cases to complete \nsex-stratified analyses . \n3.1.3  Incorporating new information into previous conclusions  for an overall \nassessment of evidence related to carcinogenicity of HCl  \nCombining the results of literature that we reviewed  for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and this one, we \nfound a total of 22 occupational epidemiology studies . The information included in the three \noccupational epidemiology studies that we identified with publication dates in 2021 or later does \nnot alter the conclusions  we reached in 2021 . Taken together, the results  of the available \nliterature did not suggest that occupational exposure to HCl increase d the risk of cancer .  \nTwo of the occupational epidemiology studies provided quantitative exposure data. Bond et al. \n(1991)  estimated cumulative and maximum average HCl exposures for subjects in a nested case -\ncontrol study concerning lung cancer mo rtality. Compared to subjects with no estimated  \nexposure, subjects with 2 ppm -years to 3.9 ppm -years  (0.15  to 5.81 mg/m3-year) 2F3, 4.0 to 12.4 \nppm-years  (5.96 , 18.48 mg/m3-year) , and 12.5 ppm -years (18.63 mg/m3-year) or greater \nshowed non -statistically significant risk ratios  of 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.6 ,1.3), 1.2 \n(95% CI: 0.8,1.9), and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6, 1.8), respectively. The re was no evidence of a trend  \nacross these groups (chi2 = 0.14, p = 0.35).  When categorized according to  maximum average \nexposures, compared to unexposed subjects, subjects with a maximum of less than 2 ppm (2.98 \nmg/m3*) showed a risk ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2) and subjects with a maximum of greater \nthan or equal to 2 ppm (2.98 mg/m3*) showed a  risk ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8,1.6). Neither \ncumulative exposures nor maximum average exposures yielded statistically significant results for \nany exposure level.  \n3 Here and elsewhere, conversions from p pm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n8 Coggon et al. (1996)  reported non -statisticall y significant results when analyzing aerodigestive \ncancer mortality and maximum acid mist exposure levels. Compared to unexposed subjects, \nsubjects ever exposed to less than 1 mg/ m3 showed an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI: 0.2, 15.8), \nand subjects exposed to 1  mg/m3 or greater showed an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.3, 5.7). \nNotably , the maximum exposures include sulfuric acid or HCl mists  rather than HCl exclusively , \nwhich is an important distinction because IARC concluded that HCl exposures other than mists \nwere not carcinogenic . Despite this  mixed exposure  (mixed acid mists) , the odds ratios reported \nby Coggon et al.  (1996)  were not statistically significant .   \nThe effects of HCl exposure ha ve also been investigated in animal studies ( see Appendix, Table \nA2). The carcinogenicity of HCl was examined in groups of 100 Sprague -Dawley  rats exposed by \ninhalation  to either  gaseous HCl, formaldehyde , two types of combinations of HCl and \nformaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week over 122 \nweeks  (Albert et al. 1982; Sellakumar 1985) . Results were also compared to those for unexposed \ncontrol animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) 3F4 in the HCl -only exposure. \nFollowing sacrifice, animals were examined fo r tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special \nattention to the respiratory tract. Results  of the study indicated increased  incidence of  \nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of animals exposed to HCl \nalone as compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed.   \nOther cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development 2002)  \u2013 a dermal exposure study (Narat, 1925 as cited by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  and an oral exposure study \n(Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . No \nmalignant tumors were reported  in 99 mice dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions \ncontaining 3 -5% HCl every 1-2 days , and then weekly for 4 -6 additional weeks (total exposure \nduration 25 -46 weeks) (Narat,1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment 2002) .  \nDyer et al.  (1946, as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  \norally exposed groups of mice to a combination of HCl (1 -2.5 moles per liter) and either a \n\u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene ( 40 mice) and reported n o \nexcess cancer or pre -cancerous lesions observed in the stomachs of animals from either group \nexposed to HCl. OECD concluded neither  study was appropriate for the assessment of \ncarcinogenicity because of the shortcomings of the stud y design .  \nAn important consideration when determining carcinogenicity is the ability of a chemical to induce \ngenotoxicity or mutagenicity. Genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals typically are not considered to  \nhave a threshold for their  effects to occur. HCl did not induce mutations in six bacterial mutation \nassays nor in one mutation assay in yeast cells (reviewed by IARC 1992; Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell \nsurvival in strains that have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two \nassays , but OECD concluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A weakly positive respo nse for \nmutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay; these results are interpreted as being \nan artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell culture medium), which itself related to cell \ndeath. Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cul tures were negative (IARC 1992; \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development  2002) . HCl induced chromosome \n4 Here and elsewhere, conversions from ppm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n9 aberrations in mammalian cells in culture at concentrations in excess of 10 mM in the cell culture \nmedia (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8) and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse  lymphoma cells, and in insect and plant cells . IARC (1992)  and OECD \n(2002)  found that the acidic pH is the responsible factor for these responses and that similar \nresponses are observed for other ino rganic acids and with acetic acid. These concentrations \nwould not be found environmentally and are thus not relevant for ambient air exposures to HCl.  \nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied, and very small numbers of cases of various types of cancers, which are expected to have \ndifferent causes and risk factors, have been identified. This is in spite of the high likelihood that \nindividuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that included \nrecognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Such mixed exposure groups would \nincorrectly assign risk to HCl if the risk were actually due to expos ure to the other chemicals that \nco-occurred with HCl. The small numbers of cases have resulted in very unstable risks estimated \nwith a high degree of uncertainty; in addition to the confounding effects of other exposures, \nchance cannot be ruled out as the cause of those findings.   \nHCl is a commonly used industrial chemical with a long history of use (IARC  1992) . Had there \nbeen a causal association between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have \nbeen raised and any potential association would have been more fully investigated. The small \nnumber of cases that have been detected in th e existing research base implies HCl is likely not a \ncarcinogen; the cases were most probably caused by co -exposures to known occupational \ncarcinogens and/or to uncontrolled confounding by non -occupational carcinogenic exposures, \nsuch as cigarette smoking.   \n3.2 Has the scientific community judged there to be a threshold for health effects \nassociated with HCl exposure? \nIt is logically impossible to prove a negative, i.e., that HCl does not cause cancer. \nHCl currently has many industrial uses, in the productio n of chlorides, fertilizers, and dyes, in the \nsteel, textile and rubber industries , in the production of numerous chemicals, making it one of \nthe most widely used chemicals in industrial processes  (IARC 1992) . Given its wide use in \nindustry, it can be inferred logically that occupational exposure to this chemical is common. Very \nlittle research on its c arcinogenicity has been carried out, however, suggesting that no or few \nsignals have emerged to indicate an elevated cancer risk associated with occupational exposure \nto HCl. This inference is borne out by the small numbers of cancer cases identified among  the \nthousands of occupationally exposed individuals included in the studies we identified (Table A1 in \nAppendix A)  and is supported by toxicological evidence indicating a lack of mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic activity by HCl.  \nSome substances may produce tumors through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing \nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations. \nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration below which no \neffects are see n. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed \nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was \nno evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985) . Furthermore, in studies where HCl was \nadministered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3)\nHCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n10 In conclusion, t he available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is \nmutagenic or carcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation \nthat are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal \nstudies indicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) led to increased incidence of \nhyperplasi a, hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations \nbelow the threshold  at which hyperplasia was reported .  \n3.3 Proposed margin of safety  \nThe US-EPA has derived a RfC for HC l of 0.2 mg/m3 (Table 1) based on the lowest adverse effect \nlevel (LOAEL) of 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3*) reported by Sellakumar et al. (1985) . The LOAEL is \nbased on the incidence of hyperplasia reported in rats chronic ally exposed to HC l via inhalation , \nand the assumption that a threshold concentration exists below which no  effects would be seen \nfollowing HC l exposure . US-EPA has designated \u201clow confidence\u201d in the current RfC based on the \nstudy used as the basis for the  RfC and the sparsity of the overall database for HC l (animal and \nhuman toxicity data). The study that serves as the basis for the RfC (Sellakumar 1985)  includes \nonly one treatment group and a control group. In a ddition, the supporting toxicity data includes \nonly subchronic toxicity studies with no additional chronic or reproductive toxicity data. Based on \nthe research completed for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and the review of both toxicology and \nepidemiology data completed from 2021 to the present, there are no additional data that could \nbe considered by US-EPA that could increase the confidence in the RfC at this time. More studies \nwould have to be conducted in order to increase confidence in the RfC, and they should include \nchronic exposures and reproductive endpoints . \nThe chronic REL (CREL) developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) , \nof 0.009 mg/m3 (Table 1) is also based  on the same ch ronic toxicity study (Sellakumar 1985)  \nthat serves as the basis for the RfC derived by US-EPA. While both the US-EPA and CalEPA \ntoxicity values are based on the same underlying  animal toxicity data and derived using similar \nmethodologies  there are significant differences in the two toxicity values with the CalEPA CREL \nbeing lower than US-EPA\u2019s RfC (RfC of 0.2 mg/m3 vs. CREL of 0.009 mg/m3). The difference  in \nthe values is related to the use of US-EPA\u2019s s guidance on  the dosimetry adjustment of inhalation \nof gases  (US-EPA 1994) . The dosimetric adjustment equation considers the surface area all \nregions of the respiratory t ract that are affected  (i.e., extrathoracic, tracheobronchial  and \npulmonary) .  When conducting the dosimetry adjustment, CalEPA only considered the \nextrathoracic surface area . However, consistent with the results reported by Sellakumar et al. \n(1985)  of increased hyperplasia in both the larynx and the trachea , US-EPA included the surface \narea of both the extrathoracic  and tracheobronchial  respiratory region. CalEPA  notes that while \nextrathoracic and tracheobronchi al effects were reported in rats following exposures to hydrogen \nchloride , the REL was based on extrathoracic effects because humans are predicted to be \nrelatively more susceptible to the effects of hydrogen chloride in that region.  However, no basis \nfor this prediction was presented by CalEPA. The US-EPA guidelines recommend that when  \neffects are observed in the mid -respiratory  tract (tracheobronchial ), this region should also  be \nconsidered in the dosimetry  adjustment calculations.  Therefore, US-EPA\u2019s approach for the \nderivation of the RfC aligns with the guidelines for dosimetric adjustments following inhalation of \ngases and  better represents  the observed respiratory effects reported  in the scientific literature.  \nUS-EPA conducted a risk assessment to determine an HBEL for HCl for the Lime Manufacturing \nsource category.  The purpose  of the assessment  was to determine the level of HCl emissions that \nwould ensure health thresholds are not exceeded with an ample margin of safety . Unit emission s \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n11 of one ton per year of HC l along with emission release parameters for each facility  were used to \nestimate the HBEL . Inhalation exposure concentrations and potential health risks were estimated \nusing US-EPA\u2019s Human Exposure Model (HEM4) , which incorporates the American Meteorological \nSociety/ US-EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) dispersion modeling system (AERMOD version \n22112) , a Gaussian plume dispersion model for modeling point, area, and volume sources of \ncontinuous air emissions  (USEPA 2005) .  \nUS-EPA provides details of the risk assessment and HBEL estimation in a  memo, \u201cRisk Approach \nto Assess a Health -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for the Lime Manufacturing \nSource Category\u201d ( US-EPA Docket: EPA -HQ-OAR-2017-0015). The reported inputs for the air \nmodeling were conservative . Unit emissions of 1 ton per year ( tpy) of HCl assigned to each \nfacility  were used as input into HEM4 to estimate the maximum ambient chronic concentration , \nwhich were th en scaled up by a factor of 300 to assess chronic and acute risks. A default hourly \nacute emissions multiplier of 10 was appl ied to reflect 1 -hour emissions ten times the annual \nemissions level divided by 8 ,760 hours per year.  Annual concentrations were estimated to assess \nchronic health impacts and 1 -hour concentrations were estimated to assess acute health impacts. \nIn assess ing the margin of safety for environmental HCl exposure, US-EPA calculated  the chronic \nnoncancer health hazard based on a hazard quotient (HQ) , which is the estimated exposure at a \nlocation divided by a reference level (e.g., the RfC). HQs of \u22641 are not li kely to cause adverse \nhealth effects , and as exposures increase above the reference level resulting in HQs >1, the \npotential for adverse effects increases. For assessing acute risks US-EPA performed a screening \nassessment using conservative assumptions combined with reasonable worst -case exposure.  \nThis screening process results in the facility being determined to pose no potential acute health \nrisks (i.e., it \u201cscreens out\u201d), or the facility  requires further assessment. The toxicity reference \nvalues used  for the risk assessment of chronic exposure were based on recommendations for \nHAPS  (USEPA 2018) . The toxicity reference values recommended by HAPs in order of priority are \nUS-EPA RfC\u2019s and CalEPA\u2019s REL  (Table 1). US-EPA\u2019s dose-response assessment for acute \nexposure to HCl was also based on the existing recommendations of HAPs. The res ults from \nscreening acute assessments were compared to C alEPA\u2019s Acute Reference Exposure Levels \n(ARELs), Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) and Emergency Response Planning Guidelines \n(ERPGs)  (Table 1). \nBased on conservative air modeling assumption s and toxicity reference values based on the best \navailable science and methodologies, US-EPA derived a HBEL emission level of 300 tpy of HCl. \nResults of the risk assessment indicated t he maximum chronic non -cancer hazard from HCl \nemissions for this source category resulted in an HQ equal to 0.2, which is 5 times below a HQ of \n1 indicating  adverse chronic health effects are not likely to occur.  For the acute assessment, \nthree facilities had acute screening HQ values equaling or approaching a value of 1. EPA reported \nthat an examination of aerial imagery of the facilities showed  maximum acute off -site HQ equal \nto 0.6.   \nOverall, the air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assu mptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values  used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n12 4.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nHumans are exposed to approximately 4 million tons per year of HCl from natural sources\n(volcanoes, marine life, combustion of vegetation), as well as industrial  sources, HCl is one of the\nmost important basic industrial chemicals IARC (1992) summa rized estimated mean air\nconcentrations of HCl in occupational settings ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 during acid\ntreatment of metals. Mean exposures during other industrial processes are estimated as >1\nmg/m3. HCl is also found in household products  such as cleaners and swimming pool additives\nand is formed during the burning of many plastics.  IARC (1992)  reported that ambient air levels\nof HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3.\nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been\nstudied  with no clear signals of elevated cancer risks emerging.  This is in spite of the high\nlikelihood that individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures\nthat inc luded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Had there been a causal\nassociation between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have been raised\nand any potential association would have been more fully investigated.\nIARC (1992)  recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industri al\nprocesses. In assessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong\ninorganic acids,\u201d IARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational\nexposure to \u201cstrong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric ac id\u201d with cancer. They therefore\nconcluded that occupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is\ncarcinogenic to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992) . In contrast, IARC\u2019s\nconclusion regarding HCl was that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of\nHCl, and they therefore assessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to\nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based\non exposure to mixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are\nfound together  in mixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the\nstrongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, su lfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the\nwhole mixture. This is likely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associ ations observed in\noccupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  All occupational epidemiology studies\npublished since the 1992 IARC determination are consistent with this conclusion.\nAs shown in Table A2 in the Appendix, t he effects of HCl exposure have also been investigated in\nanimal studies. Results  of the only chronic exposure study  indicated increased  incidence of\nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of rats exposed to HCl alone\nas compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed  (Sellakumar\n1985) . Two short term cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD\n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) : Neither  the dermal exposure\nstudy (Narat, 1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment 2002)\nnor the oral exposure study (Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development 2002)  reported any increase in cancer  occurrence .\nSome substances may produce tumors  through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing\nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations.\nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration  below which no\neffects are seen. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed\nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was\nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n13 no evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985)  and there was no evidence of genotoxicity or \ncell proliferation resulting from HCl exposures (reviewed by OECD). Furthermore, in studies \nwhere HCl was administered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm \nHCl neither cause d serious irrit ating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal studies \nindicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm led to increased incidence of hyperplasia, hyperplasia \nwould not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations  below the threshold at \nwhich hyperplasia was reported.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n acceptable \nmargin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce conservative \nair concent rations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce reasonable \nexposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity reference \nvalues used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n5.REFE RENCES\nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelson N, Snyder CA. 1982.

HCl has been known  since the \nMiddle Ages, and was first commercially produced in the early 1800\u2019 s. Because of its many \nindustria l uses,  occupational exposure to HCl is common .  \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and epidemiologic al studies  \nin exposed workers. Several authoritative groups (including the World Health Organization\u2019s \nInternational Agen cy for Research on Cancer [IARC], the International P rogramme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the  international Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n[OECD ]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of the se groups \nhave concluded that HCl is a carcinogen.  Other authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology Program) have chosen not to \nevaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is un likely ba sed on its \nphysical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association \nwith cancer .  \nRamboll US Consulting, Inc. (Ramboll) was asked by the National Lime Association to investigate \nthe potential carcinogenicity of HCl in  order to determine whether it is appropriate for US EPA to \nregulate HCl as a non -carcinogen by using an established health based threshold consistent with \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) . In addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramb oll did \na series of additional literature search es for any new studies which migh t indicate HCl is a \ncarcinogen. We employed several search strategies to make sure we uncovered any new \nscientific evidence that may not have been considered by previous asses sments. Despite  this \nbroad search, we identified  only six additional publications . This newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence . In addition to direct studies of cancer associations, we \nalso examined other supporting evide nce in th e form of genotoxicity studies or potential to \ninduce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the \nevidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often fou nd together in industrial processes . In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201c sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid \u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans ( i.e., a \u201c Group 1 \u201d carcinogen ) (IARC 1992). In contrast , IARC\u2019s conclusio n regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans ( i.e., a \u201c Group \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regardin g acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outc ome (in this case,  surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a car cinogen, either by  authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own \nsearch of the scientific literature , despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore recommends  \nthat based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d),  it would be \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n entire ly appropriate for  EPA to base its  standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, including an \nample margin of safety.  \n \n \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 1 1. INTRODUCTION  \n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (also k nown as an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. Chemists will designate the gas form as \nHCl(g) and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.  \nHCl is used in the production of chlor ides, fertilizers, and dyes, as well as in the textile and \nrubber industries.1 Commercial concentrated hydroc hloric acid  contains 36% to 38% hydrogen \nchloride in water. HCl can also be formed a s a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in \nindustrial manufacturing processes, for example from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime \n(CaO and MgO).   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air.2,3 On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white vapors due to condensation with \natmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into contact with moisture, it forms \nhydrochloric acid. In the early twentieth century, hydrogen chlo ride was created by b urning \nhydrogen gas. This method created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between \nchloride salts and sulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC, 1992).   \n1.2 Residual Risk and Technology Review   \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US  EPA) regulates \nhazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022 In the first  stage, section 112(d)  requires the US EPA to develop technology -based \nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each \ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) .4  \n\u2022 In the second stage, US EPA is required und er section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and \nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If \nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of \nsafety or to prevent an adverse environme ntal effect, US EPA must develop  standards to \naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as \nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US EPA issued MACT  \nstandards, the residual risk stage must be c ompleted within eight years of promulgation \nof the  initial technology -based standard .  \nAlso, under section 112(d)(6), US EPA must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight years and revise it, as necessary, taking into account deve lopments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US EPA will revise the rule. For efficiency, the US EPA  includes the 112(f) \n \n1 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016 -09/documents/hydrochloric -acid.pdf  \n2 https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg173.pdf  \n3 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Hydrochlo ric-acid#section=Solubility  \n4 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 2 and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory pa ckage and calls the rulemakings the Risk and \nTechnology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is based on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on  emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d Alternatively, as outlined in 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 \n7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based threshold, assuming such a \nthreshold has been established. This health -based threshold must include an ample margin of \nsafety. The US EPA will not approve a health -based threshold for  a MACT standard if a HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  As part of the statutory lime manufacturing risk and technology review, EPA \nconducted an inhalation risk assessment for HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and \nfound no unacceptable human health risk unde r worst case emissions scenarios ( 84 FR 48,723 \n(Sep. 16, 2019) ).The EPA risk assessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a \nvariety of human -health risk sc reening benchmarks as part of risk calculations. Ramboll therefore \nhas undertaken this review to confirm the status of HCl as a non -carcinogen, and validate EPA\u2019s \nrisk assessment approach . \nBased on communication with the National Lime Association ( via emai l), the gas temperature at \nthe inlet to the air pollution control device (APCDs) is typically above 400 degrees F for most \nstraight rotary and preheater lime kilns, and roughly 275 degrees for vertical kilns. These \nelevated temperatures are well above the acid dew  point for HCl (typically about 130 degrees F).   \nStack test data obtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing have also confirmed the \npresence of HCl as a gas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are \ncontrolled with dry  APCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions as mist are \nexpected to be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water, i.e., the gas is readily absorbed in \nwater.   \n1.3 Objective of this report  \nThe objective of this report is to review and s ynthesize  the scientific literature regarding the \ncarcinogenicity of HCl.  Ramboll base d this assessment on a combination of previous assessments \nby authoritative bodies, as well as our own literature search.  \n1.4 Previous assessments of HCl carcinogenicity  \nHCl has been evaluated for carcinogenicity by several authoritative agencies or groups, including \nthe World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC), the \nOrganisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ), and the International \nProgramme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). Neither the National Toxicology Program \u2019s (NTP) Report \non Carcinogen ( NTP, 2016 ) nor the US EPA\u2019s Integrative Risk Information System (IRIS) program  \nhave assessed the carcinogenicity of HCl, and neither Agency is currently evaluating the chemical \n(US EPA 2021a5; NTP, 20196). For a common chemical such as HCl, this usually means that the \nrelevant agency does not consider the evidence compelling enough to undertake a major review \n \n5 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021 -03/doc uments/iris_program_outlook_mar2021.pdf  \n6 https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/ongoing/index.html  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 3 effort  (US EPA , 2021b7; NTP, 2016a8; NTP 2016b ).  \nThe stated purpose of IARC reviews, published in monographs, is to identify cancer hazards , i.e., \nagents that are capable of causing cancer. IARC is explicit that hazard s are separate from actual \nrisks, with the latter depend ing on factors including exposure duration  and concentration. \nSubstances are raised for review by IARC every five years by an Advisory Group  that makes its \nrecommendations from nominations submitted by scienti sts and regulatory agencies . The \nselection is based on the ava ilability of data and current public health priorities, as well as the \nexistence of signals that the substance may pose a cancer hazard9. IARC convened a working \ngroup of experts  to evaluate HCl i n October 1991 and published their findings in a monograph \n(IARC 1992) . Based on their evaluation of the occupational cohort and case -control studies and \ntoxicological data  available in 199 1 (see section 2.1 for discussion of these studies) , IARC  \nconcluded  that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in humans and that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in animals. Based on these findings, \nIARC concluded that HCl is not classifiable  as to it s carcinogenicity in  humans (Group 3).  This \ncategory is used for agents, mixture s, and exposure circumstances which IARC has evaluated \nand found that \u201c the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or \nlimited in experimental animals. \u201d If IARC finds evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity , \u201c\u2026the \nWorking Grou p may add a sentence to the evaluation to characterize the agent as well -studied \nand without evidence of carcinogenicity.\u201d The other classifications used by IARC are  carcinogenic \nto humans  (Group 1); probably carcinogenic to humans  (Group 2A) and possibly carcinogenic to \nhumans (Group 2B)9. In its history, IARC classified only one chemical as probably not \ncarcinogenic  to humans (Group 4) , and the Agency eliminated this category in 2019 ; more tha n \nhalf of the 1,090 chemicals it has reviewed have been classif ied as Group 3 .10 11 \nIARC also reviewed other inorganic acids in the same monograph , including \u201csulfuric acid  and \nother strong inorganic acids\u201d  (IARC  1992) . In contrast to their conclusion for HCl, t heir conclusion \nfor sulfuric acid and other strong inorgani c acids  was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence  that \noccupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d \nIARC\u2019s overall evaluation was that \u201cOccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists \ncontaining sulfuric  acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) \u201d (IARC 1992).  This is relevant \nbecause the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that must include sulfur ic acid. While \nsulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid exposures , the exposure c ontained in \nthe mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive \nthe relationship for the whole mixture. Thi s is likely the explanation for the sporadic effects \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  \nThe Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ) Screening Information \nDataset  (SIDS) Initial Assessment Profile (2002) evaluated the scientific literature concerning \nevidence for the carcinogenicity of HCl an d concluded th at \u201cIn humans, no association between \nhydrogen chloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d Their assessment is based on \nstudies finding no association between HCl exposure and cancer  (Albert et al., 1982; Farrow et \nal., 1989; Bond et al. , 1986; Bo nd et al. , 1991; Bond et al. , 1993; Bond et al. , 1995) .

They further stated that, on the basis of the limited information available from \nindustrial survey data, and from the observations of controlled exposure studies, it is mo st \nunlikely that the general population is exposed routinely to any significant health risks from HCl.  \n2. SEARCH METHODS   \n2.1 Identifying Relevant Literature  \nIn their Monograph Volume 54, published in 1992, IARC identified a total of 8 relevant \nepidemiological studies , including 3 cohort studies ( Collins et al. 1989 ; Beaumont et al. 1967 ; \nSteenland et al 1988) and 5 case-control studies (Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond et \nal., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; and Siemiatyc ki, 1991). IARC also identified a single experimental \nanimal cancer study (Sellakumar et al., 1 985), which examined rats exposed by inhalation to \nHCl.  \nIn their SIDS document, OECD (2002) identified many of the same studies identified by IARC \n(1992), as well as one additional epidemiological study ( Farrow et al, 1989) and one \nexperimental animal study (Albert et al., 1982). They also discussed two exp erimental animal \nstudies ( a dermal exposure study, Narat, 1925; and an oral administration study, Dyer et al., \n1946) which they judged, due to study design limitations, were not appropriate for assessing \ncarcinogenic potential.  \nAfter starting with the lite rature identified by the authoritative reviews ( ICPS, 1082; IARC, 1992; \nOECD , 2002 ), we developed a literature search strategy consisting of three different approaches : \n(1) Reviewing papers published since IARC considered the carcinogenicity of HCl in 1991  that \ncited the relevant epidemiolog ical studies cited in the IARC monograph vol. 54;  (2) a search  of \nepidemiological studies addressing possible associations between exposure to HCl and cancer ; \nand (3) a targeted search of chronic (long-term) bioassays fo r cancer associated with HCl \nexposure  in experimental animals . Because HCl is a common laboratory ingredient used in many \nexperimental set -ups, a broad er literature search for animal studies or in vitro  studies would \nhave resulted in an overwhelming number  of irrelevant papers. We therefore conducted a very \ntargeted search  for additional animal studies . \nBoth t he search of epidemiological studies examining cancer as a health endpoint and the \ntargeted search of chronic bioassay studies for cancer in animals u sed PubMed, a database \ndeveloped by the National Library of Medicine that includes  more than 32 million citations for \nbiomedical literature from journal articles in life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine , \nand online books . \n2.1.1  Papers That Cited Epidemiological Papers  Included in IARC or OECD  \nUsually, authors of journal articles cite previous relevant research in their manuscripts . Ramboll \ntherefore conducted a search of scientific papers that cited the literature identified by IARC \n(1992)  or OECD ( 2002).  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 5 Using the database Google Scholar , Ramboll conducted a search for any papers that cite one or \nmore of the 9 studies identified by IARC (Sellakumar et al., 1985; Collins et al. , 1989; Beaumont \net al., 1967; Steenland et al ., 1988; Bond et al., 1983; B ond et al., 1985; Bond et al., 1986; and \nSiemiatyc ki, 1991)  or the additional epidemiological studies identified  by OECD ( Farrow  et al., \n1989). We did not perform citation searches on the experimental animal studies discussed by \nOECD (2002) because the Albert et al . (1982) bioassay study was superseded by the subsequent \npublication by  the same group  (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ), and because the two other cancer \nstudies in experimental animals (Dyer et al., 1946; Naret, 1925) were judged by OECD (2002) as \nhavin g major faults in their study design precluding conclus ions to be drawn from their results.  \n2.1.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature   \nA literature search was conducted using PubMed , based  on using  combinations of the following \nsearch terms: \u201coccupationa l\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chy drogen \nchloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -\ncontrol\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d, clinical studies were filtered out of the search so as to \nremove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s.  \n2.1.3  Targeted Pu bMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nA targeted literature search was conducted using PubMed, based  on using combinations of the \nfollowing search terms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201c chronic bioassay\u201d; and \n\u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d .  \n2.1.4  Exclusion criteria  \nPublications  were excluded at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed \nin the study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the te st material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxicity study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3. RESULTS   \n3.1 Literature Search  Findings   \nThe results  from different steps  of this search process are  outlined in Figure 1 (PRISMA diagram).  \nA total of eight epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., \n1985; Bond et al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Collins et al. 1989; Siemia tycki, 1991; Steenland et \nal., 1988 ) and one cancer study in experimental animals (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ) were included \nin the IARC (2002)  report.  A total of six epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et \nal., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond e t al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Farrow et al. 1989) and four \ncancer studies in experimental animals (Albert et al., 1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 1925; \nSellakumar et al., 1985 ) were cited in OECD (2002)12. Note, there was some overlap between  \nthese two sets of studies. Together,  a total of 13 unique  studies were identified \u2013 nine \n \n12 Note, one further publication cited by OECD ( ANON, ed. 1987 . Pestic. Toxic. Chem. News., 15(43), 6. ) was reported only in summary  form and \nneither the publication nor the abstract could be found. It was not included in the counts. OECD reported that all respiratory cancer cases in this \nstudy were smokers; therefore, confounding cannot be ruled out.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 6 epidemiological and four in animal s (see Appendix A) .  \nConducting a search of scientific publications that cite the se IARC-cited or OECD -cited studies \nresulted in a total of 1,008  publications to screen .13 We screened the tit les and abstracts of these \npublications, and identified five additional papers ( Coggon et al. 1996; Hathaway et al. 1997; \nSoskolne et al. 2011 ; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nThe PubMed search es for epidemiological publications  resulted in a total of 1,934  scientific \npublications ; after removal of duplicates  and publications that had been identified through \nauthoritative searches or citation searches , 771 unique publications  remained. The targeted \nPubMed search of the animal toxicological literature resulted in 56 publications ; after removal of \nduplicates  and publications that had been identified through authoritative searches or citation \nsearches , 34 unique publications remained.  Overall, 805 unique p ublications were identified  \nthrough both PubMed search  strategies . We screened the titles and abstracts of these unique \npublications to identify 24 publications  which warranted a f ull text screen for relevance . Only one \nadditional relevant publication was identified from this full text screen (Tsai et al. 2016 ).  \nA total o f 19 relevant articles were identified through the combined literature search strateg y, \nconsisting of  the initial nine epidemiological stud ies identified by IARC a nd OECD and four \ntoxicol ogy study identified by IARC and OECD , and the six additional  articles (five epidemiological \nstudies  identified through the  citation search of the initial articles, and one additional article \nresulting from the very broad PubMed search es) (Figure 1 ).  \n3.2 Summary of Findings  \nThe 19 relevant publications  identified  through this extensive literature search included:  13 \nepidemiological  studies containing  statistical  analys es of the association between exposure to HCl \nand cancer ; four publicati ons examining  cancer in experimental animals;  one commentary/letter \nto the editor , and one review . Below is a discussion of three cohort studies ( Collins et al ., 1989; \nBeaumont et al ., 1987; Steenland et al ., 1988), ten case-control studies  (Bond et al ., 1983; \nBond et al ., 1985; Bond et al ., 1986; Bond et al. , 1991; Siemiatycki , 1991; Fritschi and \nSiemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b; Farrow et al. 1989; Coggon et al. , 1996; \nSosklone et al. , 2011), and four animal toxicity stud ies (Sellakumar e t al., 1985; Albert et al., \n1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 192 5). See Appendix A for list of all relevant publications.  A \ndetailed  summary of the epidemiological studies, including information on study characteristics, \nstatistical analyses, and limitation s, is included in Appendix B.  \n \n \n13 Among the experimental animal s tudies, only the Sellakumar et al. 1985 st udy was the subject of our search because the Albert et al., 1982 \npublication was superseded by the subsequent Sellakumar et al., 1985 publication, and the other two experimental animal cance r studies were \nvery old  and inadequate . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 7  \n3.3 Discussion of Individual Publicat ions \nWe discuss individual studies of the carcinogenicity of HCl and HCl mists below. Further details of \nthese studies can be found in Appendix B. \n \n\nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 8 3.3.1  Epidemiolog ical Studies   \nIn a cohort study  of steel workers involved in pickling operations, Beaumont et al.  (1987) \nexamined lung cancer mortality patterns in 1,165 workers exposed to sulfuric acid mist and other \nacid mists (primarily HCl mist) . Jobs were categorized by acid use (sulfuric acid or other acid)  \nand exposure potential  (i.e., the likelihood of daily exposure) in order to define the following  \nexposure categor ies: (1) any acid exposure  (the entire exposed cohort) ; (2) sulfuric acid \nexposure only ; (3) sulfuric acid only with probable daily  exposure  (a subset of Group 3) ; (4) \nother  (not sulfuric) acid exposure only ; and (5) exposure to both sulfuric acid and other acids . \nThe analyses included those who were employed for at least 6 months in a pickling -related job  \nwith at least 1 day of work prior to 1965. Compared with men in the general U.S. population , the \n189 workers with exposure to other acids ( not sulfuric acid ) had a statistically significant \nincreased lung cancer mortality rate (SMR 2.24, 95% CI 1 .02, 4. 26) based on  9 observed deaths.  \nWhen they used a more appropriate comparison to US steel workers, however, the risk estimate \nwas lower  (SMR 2.0 , 95% CI 1.06, 3.78).  No data on other occupational exposures or smoking \nhabits  were included in the study , and confounding by smoking status, e specially, cannot be \nruled out . The authors attempted several indirect adjustments for smoking, with mixed results . \nThe authors discussed  several additional limitations of the study  and suggested that chance \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation  for the re sults.  \nSteenland et al.  (1988) conducted a  reanalysis of 879 members of the Beaumont et al. (1987) \nsteelworker cohort who had  information related to presence or absence of diagnosis of laryngeal  \ncancer (Steenland et al. , 1988). US referent rates , calculate d using national surveys of cancer \nincidence , were used for comparison . Most workers in the analysis were exposed to sulfuric acid , \neither with or without other acids . Two of the laryngeal cancer  cases were exposed to acids other \nthan sulfuric ac id and thr ee were exposed to a mixture of acids ; these numbers are too small to \ngenerate reliable statistical estimates of association . The authors  reported an increased risk of \nlaryngeal cancer in steel pickler workers compared to US referent rates (RR 2. 6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.0  \n(as reported by IARC 1992 ), however this includes all 9 cases a cross all exposure groups ( sulfuric \nacid, other acids only, and mixture of acids).  In its evaluation, t he IARC (1992) working group \nnoted that confounding by sulfuric acid co uld not be  ruled out . The authors compared the \nsmoking habits of their incident cancer  cohort obtained from next of kin interviews  with the \nsmoking habits of the US population in 1965. They found that in their cohort \u201cthere was a similar \noverall prevalence of smokin g compared with all United States men but cohort members who did \nsmoke smoked more than the United States average.\u201d The a uthors also used methods similar to \nthose described by Beaumont et al. (1987) to  indirectly adjust for smoking habi ts, but residual \nconfounding by smoking, in addition to exposure to sulfuric acid in the mixed exposure group, \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation for the results . \nMortality patterns were examined in a follow -up study of 8,854 workers from four Cyanimid \nplants in the United  States and the Netherlands , where 2,293 of the workers were believed to \nhave been exposed to the chemical acrylamide  (Collins et al., 1989) . Each plant had mortality \npatterns similar to other worker populations , and no excess mortality  across all plants was \nobserved for any of the 26 cancer sites examined . However, a n excess in lung cancer (SMR 1.3 2) \nwas observed in one of the four facilities  studied ( the Warners  facility ). In this facility,  11 of the \n63 lung cancer deaths were in a department where there was exposure to HCl (data not \npresented in paper) . This paper was discussed by the IARC working group (1992), who noted \nthat no information for the expected numbers of cases in that facility was provided, making it \ndifficult to interpret that observation . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 9 A case-control study of brain cancer mortality at a Dow Chemical plant in Texas included an \nevaluat ion of the potential association between brain cancer  and occupational exposure to  HCl \n(Bond et al., 1983) . A total of 28 former workers were identified who had died from brain cancer ; \n13 of these had evidence of HCl exposure  based on a review of job titles . The study  incorporated \ndata from  two control groups  selected from the plant : Group A selected from 110 white male \ndeaths without cancer (42 with evidence of HCl exposure based on job title) and Group B \nselected from a random sample of 111 employees  without regard to vital status or cancer status  \n(51 with evidence of HCl exposure) . There was no statistically significant association observed \nbetween any expos ure to HCl and brain tumors among workers when compared to either control \ngroup (Odds ratio ( OR) 1.40, 90% CI 0.70, 2.80 ; OR 1.02, 90% CI 0.81, 1.29 ). Sub-analyses \nbased on duration of employment focused on those who were employed for 1 -4 years, as there  \nwere only four cases with 20 or more years  of employment . There  was no evidence of  an \nincrease in risk of brain cancer associated with HCl exposure  in this subgroup (cases: n = 5, \ncontrols: n = 15; OR 2.02 , 90% CI 0.5, 8.1) . Note that these authors reported  90% confidence \nintervals, rather than the usual 95% confidence intervals , which increases the likelihood of \ndetecting an association. This choice is usually made w hen the focus is on screening for potential \nassociations  and generating hypotheses to be tes ted in future, more rigorous studies.  \nSubsequent ly, Bond et al. (1985) published a case-control study of renal cancer mortality and \nexposure to HCl based  in the sam e Dow Chemical plant , using the same study population and \ncontrol groups  examined earlier (B ond et al., 1983). The authors  did not observe an increased \nrisk of  renal cancer in workers exposed to HCl (26 deaths from renal cancer; 12 with evidence of \nexposure to HCl based on job title) as compared to either control group (OR  0.90, 90% CI 0.44, \n1.83 based on 44 exposed out of 92 controls ; OR 0.86, 90% CI 0.40, 1.86  based on 50 exposed \nout of 98 controls ). Cases and controls were matched on age, race, and sex, but potential  \nconfounding  by exposure to other occupational chemicals  was not controlled . The authors did not \nobserve substantial differences in smoking habits  between groups and therefore reported that \nsmoking was unlikely to have been a confounder.  \nIn a third case-control study  based in the same Dow Chemical plant, Bond et al. (1986) analyzed \nthe risk of lung cancer associated with  hydrogen chloride  exposure based on job title . There were \n308 lung cancer deaths compared with t wo control groups chose n from the plant : a decedent \ncontrol group and a living control group. Each contained 308 men individually matched to cases \non race, year of birth + 5 years, and year of hire. Separate  results of cases with each control \ngroup were similar, so t he authors pooled the control groups for greater statistical power.  The \nauthors did not observe an association  between  HCl exposure and lung cancer overall  (exposed \ncases: n = 129, exposed  control s: n = 245,  OR 1.02, 95% CI 0. 77, 1.35) or with a 15 year \nlatency period ( exposed cases: n = 108, exposed controls: n = 218, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68, \n1.24).  The authors  collected information on  potential confounders and noted the following  to be \nstatistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk , as expected : cigarette smoking, vitamin \nA intake, use of vitamin supplements, and education level . These findings lend su pport to the \nvalidity of the main analyses.  However, due to small number of subjects available for analysis , \nthe authors appropriately chose  not to control for these potential confounders . \nThe Dow chemical worker  population was re -evaluated again,  using exposure estimates derived \nfrom job assignments, duration of exposure , and cumulative exposure  (Bond et al. , 1991). \nAnalyses to estimate the risk of mortality from lung, trachea, and bronchial  cancer  (combined) \nwere performed without and with a 16-year latency period and controlling for pack-years  of \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 10 smoking . There was no  relationship between HCl exposure and lung cancer in any of the HCl \nexposure groups  (see Appendix B) . \nCoggon et al. (1996) investigated the risk of upper aerodigestive cancer mortality from exposure \nto mineral acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) in a study of steel and battery manufacture workers \n(Coggon et al., 1996). The authors categorized exposure as (1) no exposure to any acid mists; \n(2) low exposure to acid mists (<1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid or HCl); and high exposure to acid mists \n(>1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid o r HCl). Based on just 15 cases , the authors  reported no convincing \nassociation between exposure to mixed acid mists and upper aerodigestive cancer mortality in \nany category of exposure conce ntration and duration (see appendix B). The study also evaluated \nthe association of \u201cdefinite\u201d exposure to mixed acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) and \u201call cancer\u201d \nmortality compared to that in the national population and found no evidence of an increase in \ncancer mortality  among the workers (full cohort SMR 0.88, 95% C I 0.79, 0.98; never exposed \nSMR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.91; definitely exposed SMR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79, 1.05 ).  \n \nSoskolne at al. (2011) examined the association between lung cancer and occupation al exposure \nto specific acids (HCl, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, ac etic acid, hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, \nhydrocyanic acid, sulfuric dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen)  in a population -based study  of 178 \ncases and 167 controls in Toronto, Canada . Proxy  interviews provided estimates of exposure \nconcentration and frequency of exposure  based on work history,  which the authors used to \ncalculate an exposure index that factored in the duration of exposure in months. There was no \nincrease in risk of lung cance r for those \u201cever\u201d exposed vs. unexposed  to HCl (OR  0.98, 95% CI \n0.71, 1.35) or for those with low estimated  exposure vs. unexposed (OR  0.80, 95% CI 0.53, \n1.22). The high exposure group  had a non -statistically significant increase in risk, based on 83 \ncases (OR  1.24, 95% CI 0.79, 1.96) (see appendix B). The authors considered all  cancers of the \nlip, mouth, retromolar area, nasopharynx, larynx, and nasal sinus as lung cancer for analysis.  \n \nIn another population -based case -control study, this time in Montrea l, Canada, Siemiatiycki \n(1991) examined t he association s between HCl exposure and 11 differen t cancers ( esophagus, \nstomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, kidney, skin melanoma, and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma) . The target population w as men aged 35 to 70  years who were living  in the \nMontreal metropolitan area. Cases had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the selected \ncancer sites  with the date of initial diagnosis between September 1979 and June 1985 . A total of \n4,576 eligible cas es were ascertained. Data were analyzed using cancer controls , i.e., all cancer \ncases with cancers of sites other than the site being analyzed, and popul ation controls . \nPopulation controls had no  cancer diagnoses  and comprised  an age -stratified random samp le \ndrawn from a list of  all adult Canadian citizens resident in the province that were eligible to vote . \nDetailed job -history interviews were conducted a mongst all cancer cases to classify exposure. \nThe a uthors reported that p opulation controls were interv iewed in a manner as similar as possible \nto the cancer cases.   \nExposure to specific substances and concentration and frequency of exposure  were estimated  \nbased on job categories . Based on this coding, the authors  analyzed the relationships between  \n\u201cany exp osure\u201d and \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d (a subset of \u201cany exposure\u201d) to HCl and each of the \n11 cancer sites , with confounding assessed separately  for each cancer site . Potential confounders \nincluded  age, family income, ethnic origin, birthplace , smoking, alcohol  intake, coffee \nconsumption,  body mass index , and self - or proxy -respondent . After adjustment , there was no  \nstatistically significant assoc iation between 10 of the 11 cancers and exposure to HCl (see \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 11 Appendix B) . The risk of non -Hodgkins lymphoma was highe r among those with any exposure to \nHCl vs. no exposure : OR=1.5  (90% CI 1.0, 2.2 ) based on 90% confidence intervals, which are \nused in hypot hesis-generating analyses because they are more likely to detect associations than \nthe standard  95% confidence  interv al.  \nThe a uthors also evaluated the association between HCl exposure and certain cancer sites in \nsubsets of the population : (1) all ethnic groups, cancer controls ; (2) all ethnic groups, population \ncontrols; (3) French -Canadians only, cancer controls; and (4) French -Canadians only, population \ncontrols . Analyses  within each group were conducted for any and substantial exposure to HCl . \nFrom these eight sets of analyses, the authors reported  results for three cancer sites : rectum, \nlung-oat cell, and non -Hodgki n\u2019s lymphoma (see appendix B). There was borderline  statistically \nsignificant  elevated risk for non -Hodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma in the French -Canadian cancer control s \nsubset (n = 18, OR 1.6 , 90% CI 1.0, 2.5) and  lung-oat cell cancer in the all ethnic groups cancer \ncontrol subset (n = 19, OR 1.6, 9 0% CI 1.0, 2.6)  from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl . When limited to \nthose with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl, results for lung -oat cell cancer remained borderline \nstatistically significant (n=8, OR 2.1, 90% CI 1.0, 4.5) and results  for non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \nwere not statistically significant ( n = 6, OR 1.5 , 95% CI 0.7, 3.2).  The a uthors reported a \nstatistically  significantly elevated risk of rectum cancer from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl (n = 18, OR \n1.9, 90% CI 1.1, 3.4) in the French Ca nadian population subset, but this association was smaller \nand not statistica lly significant  when limited to those with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl (rectum: \nn = 5, OR 1.5, 90% CI 0.5, 3.8). The very small number of cases and wide 90% confidence \nintervals  around these estimates do not supply convincing evidence of an association b etween \nHCl exposure and risk of rectal cancer.  \nFritschi and Siemiatycki (1996a ) conducted additional analyses on the association of 11 \nsubstances and non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma , adju sting for age, proxy status, income, and ethnicity . \nExposure was categorized as \u201csubstantial\u201d , defined as having probable or definite exposure and \nmore than 5 years of exposure at high frequency concentration , or \u201cnon-substantial\u201d exposure. \nThere was no  statistically significant association between occupational HCl exposure and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma  at either exposure level ( substantial exposure  n=6, OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5, \n3.4; non -substantial exposure  n=16,  OR 1.6 , 95% CI 0.9, 3.0). Fritschi and Siemiatycki (1996b) \nfurther evaluated exposure to several chemicals and melan oma. Risk results for HCl and \nmelanoma were not provided, because it was \u201cnot associated with melanoma in any multivariate \nanalyses\u201d (Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nIn a pilot study precedi ng the full study  by Siemiatycki et al , (1991 ), Farrow et al. (19 89) \ninterviewed 39 male and 24 female preleukemia patients diagnosed from September 30, 1985 to \nSeptember 30 , 1986 for lifetime occupational  exposure to specific chemicals , one of which was \nHCl. When compared with controls from a n outpatient ear, nose  and throat (ENT) surgical clinic \nmatched to cases on age and sex, there was no meaningful difference between  cases and \ncontrols (cases: n = 5, mean exposure = 21,000 h ours; controls: n = 4, mean exposure = 5,000 \nhours). The authors did not report odds rat ios for these findings , which would have been \napproximately 1 .0 based on the nearly identical numbers of cases and controls .  \n  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 12 3.3.2  Cancer Studies in Experimental Animals  \nThe carcinogenicity of HCl wa s examined in two chronic cancer stud ies in rats as part of studies \ndesigned to explore the combined impacts of inhaled HCl and another irritating gas, \nformaldehyde  (Albert et al., 1982; Sellakumar et al., 1985) . This combination of gases is found in \nthe degradation of a carcinogen, bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME). Since formaldehyde is both an \nirritating gas and a  carcinogen in animal inhalation studies (Swenberg et al., 1980) , and HCl is \nalso an irritating gas, the  studies reported in these two publications  (Albert et al., 1982; \nSellakumar et al., 1985) tested whether inhalation of the combination of formaldehyde and HCl \nwere more carcinogenic than inhalation of formaldehyde alone . Part of the controls in these test s \nwere groups of animals exposed only to fo rmaldehyde, or only to HCl, allowing an assessment of \nthe carcinogenicity of HCl.  \nIn the ear lier study  (Albert et al., 1982) , a group of 99 eight-week old male Sprague -Dawley  rats \nwere exposed by inhalation to a mixture of 10 ppm HCl and 14 ppm formaldehyd e for 6 hours \nper day , 5 days per week, for their lifetime. Control groups (50 rats per group) were exposed to \neither air introduced to the cages in the same manner as the exposed group  (the \"sham\u201d \ncontrol) , or simply held in exposure chambers without any exposure. Authors reported benign  \nsquamous meta plasia, and two types of nasal cancer \u2014 squamous  papillo ma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma \u2014 in rats expose d to the mixture of HCl and formaldehyde ; these lesions were not \nfound in the control group . This result i s consistent with precious ly published  results obtained \nwhen rats were exposed  to formaldehyde alone ( Swenberg et al., 1980 ), and are consistent of \nthe cancer resulting from exposure to formaldehyde . \nA second experiment exposed groups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats to either inhaled \nHCl, formaldehyde, combinations of HCl and formaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 \nhours per day, 5 d ays per week . This publication (Albert et al., 1982) reports interim results after \n84 weeks ; full results  are reported in the Sellakumar et al. (1985) publication , below.  \nGroups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats were exposed  by inhalation  to either  HCl[g], \nformaldehyde, two types of combinations of HCl[g] and formaldehyde, or a control group of air \nalone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week  over 122 week s (Sellakumar et al., 1985) . Results \nwere also compared to unexposed control animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm ( 14.9 \nmg/m3) in the HCl -only exposure as well as the HCl plus formaldehyde exposure gr oup. Following \nsacrifice, animals were examined for tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special attention \nto the re spiratory tract (th e site of formaldehyde -induced tumors).  While hyperplasia (indicative \nof cell proliferation)  was evident in the l arynx and trachea of animals  exposed to HCl alone as \ncompared to air controls or colony controls , no excess cancer was observed.  In the groups \nexposed to both HCl and formaldehyde, the cancer response was attributed to formaldehyde . \nTwo other cancer studie s in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (2002) \u2013 a dermal \nexposure study  (Narat, 1925) and an oral exposure study ( Dyer et al., 1946 ). The dermal study \nincluded 99 mice were dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions containing 3 -5% HCl  \nevery 1-2 days until skin lesions were observed and then weekly for 4-6 additional weeks (total \nexposure duration 25-46 weeks) (Narat, 1925). No malignant tumor s were reported, and OECD \nconcluded that the study  is not appropriate for the assessment of carcino genicity  because the of \nshortcomings in the study design  (lack of negative control, brief exposure period).  The oral study \nDyer et al., 1946) included was a study designed to examine whether acids present in the \nstomach, such as HCl, would modify the carci nogenicity of 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene . In this \nstudy, groups of  mice (4 different strains) were exposed to a combination of HCl (1-2.5 moles \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 13 per liter)  and either a \u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene (40 \nmice) through a tube inserted into their stomachs (Dyer et al., 1946). Other exposure groups \nwithout HCl were also included in th e study. No excess  cancer or pre -cancerous lesions were \nobserved  in the stomachs of animals from either group  exposed to HCl . However, OECD \nconclude d the study is not appropriate for the assessment of carcinogenicity because of the \nshortcomings of the stud y design (inconsistent strain , short exposure duration , single exposure \nconcentration ).  \n3.3.3  Reviews and Commentar ies Identified  \nHathaway (1997) provide d a commentary that was critical of the methodological quality of \nstudies reviewed by IARC (1992). Among other concerns, Hathaway noted small numbers of \ncases leading to imprecise estimates, shown by wide confidence intervals, and likely \nmisclassifi cation when exposure to HCl was part of a mixed exposure category. Misattribution of \nrisks associated with exposure to some other substance that was part of the mixture could have \nresulted in some of the elevated point estimates reported by the authors if that ot her substance \nwas carcinogenic and HCl is not. Hathaway  also noted inconsistencies in reporting the number of \nexposed and unexposed cases in at least one study , which would affect the results given the \nsmall number of exposed cases available for ana lysis. \nTsai et al. (2016) conducted a review of the regulatory systems and human health effects \ndesignated by the Taiwan government under the Air Pollution Control Act. The study reviewed \ncarcinogenic and non -carcinogenic health risks for designated air to xics. T he study compiled data \nfrom international agencies such as IARC, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the American Conference of Governmental \nIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH)  and based on this d ata cat egorized HCl as non -carcinogenic.  \n4. DISCUSSION   \n4.1 Conclusions  of Authoritative  Reviews  \nThe consensus  opinion of multiple authoritative bodies is that HCl is unlikely to be a carcinogen. \nIARC classified HCl in Group 3 (not classifiable), which is the cla ssifica tion group used when  the \nchemical is considered least likely to present a cancer  hazard . Note that IARC has only classified \na single chemical as \u201cprobably not carcinogenic to humans \u201d (Group 4), and they no longer \nconsider this category. OECD went further, stating \u201cIn humans, no association between hydrogen \nchloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d IARC also reviewed other inorganic acids \nin the same monograph, including \u201csu lfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids\u201d (IARC 1992). \nIn contrast to their conclusion for HCl, their conclusion for sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic \nacids was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence that occupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid \nmists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d IARC\u2019s overall evaluat ion was that \u201cOccupational \nexposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group \n1)\u201d (IARC 1992). This is relevant because the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that \nmust include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid \nexposures, the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome \n(in this case, surfuric a cid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This likely the \nexplanation for the sporadic effects observed in occupational studies of mixed acids containing \nHCl. \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 14 ICPS did a broader assessment of potential toxicity to the general population and c oncluded that \nother than during accidental releases, it is most unlikely t hat the general population is exposed \nroutinely to any significant health risks from HCl. Furthermore, neither US EPA nor the NTP have \nidentified HCl as a chemical worthy of assessin g for carcinogenicity. Thus, although HCl is a \nwidely used chemical, no au thoritative body has concluded that it poses a cancer risk.  An \nextensive search of the primary published scientific literature identified a total of 4 publications \nnot considered by the authoritative bodies  discussed above. One of these publications is a r eview \nand one is a commentary; two publications are epidemiolocal studies. Neither alter s the \nconclusions of the prior assessments.  \n4.2 Supporting Evidence  \n4.2.1  Evidence Regarding Genotoxicity   \nMutation or genetic changes are often viewed as a first step in carcin ogenicity , so various assays  \nexamining such changes, as well as assays designed to predict such changes (collectively \nreferred to as genotoxicity assays)  are often used to predict cancer  potential . HCl did not induce \nmutations in six bacterial mutation ass ays or one mutation assay  in yeast cells  (reviewed by \nIARC, 1992; OECD, 2002). A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell survival in strains \nthat have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two assays but OECD \nconcluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by OECD, 2002) . A \nweakly p ositive response for mutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay ; these \nresults are interpreted as being an artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell cu lture \nmedium), which itself related to cell death . Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cultures \nwere negative (reviewed by IARC, 1992; OECD, 2002) . HCl induced chromo some aberrations in \nmammalian cells in culture  when concentrations were in excess of 1 0 mM in the cell culture \nmedia  (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8)  and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse l ymphoma cells, and  in insect and plant  cells in a very limited set of \nstudies ; both  IARC (1992) and OECD ( 2002)  found that the acidic pH  is the responsible  factor for \nthese responses and that  similar responses are observed for other inorganic acids and with acetic \nacid. These concentrations would not be found environmentally14 and are thus not relevant for \nambient air exposures to HCl.  \n4.2.2  Evidence for Inducing Cell Proliferation   \nIn addition to mutagenic  carcinogens, there are some carcinogens that are believed to act \nthrough a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing extensive cell turnover which leads to the \npossibility of replication errors leading to mutations. However, such mechanisms are believed t o \nhave a threshold concentration below which no effects are seen. In the case of HCl, there is \nfurther evidence from the co -exposure study of Sellakumar et al. (198 5), where exposure to 10 \nppm HCl did not cause serious irritating effects and did not enhanc e the carcinogenicity of \nformaldehyde. Thus, there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic ca rcinogens.  \n \n14 10 mM corresponds to ~355 ppm in solution or 355 mg/Liter. In comparison, HCl concentrations in the ambient air usually do no t exceed 0.01 \nmg/m3 (IARC, 1992). Conservative m odelling data  (unpublished Ramboll report to National Lime Assoc iation, 2019), pre dicts that the maximum \nconcentration of HCl in the air at the fenceline kiln would be 0.0012 mg/m3.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 15 4.3 Limita tions of the Existing Literature ( for client discussion only )  \nThe epidemio logical studies evaluated by IARC and OECD  were methodologically limited . \nLimitations included lack of exposure verification or measurement; inadequate control for \nconfounding exposures associated with certain cancers, small sample size  or small numbers of  \ncases, leading to lack of statistical power . In addition, many of the studies evaluated mixed \nexposures and mixed outcomes. The use of mixed exposure groups is par ticularly germane, as \nthe mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic a cid mists , which are \nclassified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl and these other acids, the apparent \nassociation between HCl and cancer  will be inflated due to the effect of the other acids .  \nIn spite of these weaknesses, the overall conclusi on by IARC based on their review of the \nepidemiological data is supported by the small number of cases of cancers observed in various \noccupational cohorts as well a s by the toxicological evidence that HCl does not have carcinogenic \nproperties.  \n5. CONCLUSIONS   \nHCl has been assessed for carcinogenic potential by multiple authoritative  bodies . After a \nthorough  search for new studies  post-dating those assessments , Ramboll c oncluded that the \nscientific evidence does not suggest  it poses carcinogenic  risks. In addi tion to direct studies of \ncancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity \nstudies or potential to induce cell proliferati on. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evide nce for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogen ic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinoge nicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies  of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use .  Ramboll therefore \nrecommends that based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d), it \nwould be entirely appropriate for EPA to base its standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, \nincluding an ample margin of safety.  \nReferences  \nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelso n N, Snyder CA. 1982.

Trinity was asked to review the model \nsetup, modeling procedures and input data to verify that EPA\u2019s approach was reasonable and consistent with the data provided to EPA by the industry.   Below is a summary of our review.  \n Trinity first reviewed the modeling input parameters used by EPA.\n3 This review focused on the facilities that \nEPA had determined were the \u201cworst -case\u201d  and therefore were the basis of supporting the proposed  HBEL.  \nThe three facilities that EPA concluded were the worst -case contributors to ambient HCl were:  1) Cemex \nPonce,  PR; 2)  Carmeuse River Rouge,  MI; and 3)  Carmeuse Maysville , KY. The stack parameters for the two \nCarmeuse plants were compared to NLA\u2019s records as well as prior EPA modeling for this rulemaking. The \nstack parameters were Cemex were only compared to prior EPA modeling. Overall , the stack parameters \nwere consistent with avail able data, even though we did identify minor differences in exhaust temperature \n(<0.01% deviation from available data ).  Additionally, Trinity reviewed the air dispersion modeling \nprocedure (i.e., the modeling techniques and procedures applied)  for developing the HBEL .  We did not find \nany material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the analysis  is consistent with prior methods for \nanalyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \n \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has  proposed an HBEL for HCl  providing conservative  estimates of \nconcentrations in ambient air , the analysis relies on input data from the industry  for the \u201cworst case\u201d \nsources and applied the air dispersion in a manner consistent with accepted practice.  Therefore , we believe  \nthe predicted modeling impacts suppor t EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c 300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime \nManufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in \nthe source category\u201d.4 \n \n \n1  89 FR  28, page 9092.  \n2 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n3 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0184.  \n4 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n \n \n \nMarch 1, 2023 \n \n \nJonathan De\u2019Ath \nNational Lime Association \n200 North Glebe Rd. Ste 800 \nArlington, VA 22203 \n \n \nRE: Proposed Lime MACT Detection Limit Review \n   \n \nDear Mr. De\u2019Ath,  \n \nAlliance Technical Group, LLC (Alliance) has reviewed the series eleven (11) of reports that were provided to \ndetermine industry average achievable Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants \n(OHAPs) testing at Lime Kilns, specifically for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  Two key considerations of this \nreview were the way in which the MDL was determined in the source testing reports, and the consideration of \nbulk corrections for moisture and oxygen content that are called for in the proposed rule. Brief summaries follow \nimmediately, with more detailed explanations on subsequent pages. \n \nMDL Summary \nIn brief, our position is that EPA selected improper MDLs from the reports by using the standard view of picking \nthe lowest 5.  This inherently selected 4 reports that use a noise value in lieu of a proper MDL, thereby biasing the \noutcome low.  We propose that EPA revisits the achievable detection limit determination by excluding reported \nMDLs that do not conform to EPA\u2019s standards on determining the MDL for FTIR testing. \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Summary \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet (not corrected for moisture) basis and dry corrected basis.  This creates \nsome noise in the data set.  Ultimately the values in the proposed rule do not appear to contain a correction for \nmoisture in the source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other \ncomponents.  For example, if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture corrected basis from \na source that contains 15% moisture that becomes 1.176 ppmvd.  We believe that especially in the case here where \nresults from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same basis, rather than a mix \nof wet and dry corrected results.  As this total result may contain some mix of detected and non-detected \ncompounds, the MDLs used for this level setting should include this adjustment criteria.   \n \nIn a similar vein, as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, we believe some average \nOxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the emissions limit calculation. \n \n \n \n \nMDL Discussion \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data submitted.  Both are from \nASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA Method 320, which is the standard method \nfor FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from stationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL \ndocumentation and are not included in further discussion. \n \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the detector noise in a pure \nblank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound.  This is useful to determine the analytical \nuncertainty of a value but is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \n \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the noise of the detector, but \nwith the inclusion of major matrix interference.  This is generally regarded as a more appropriate MDL \ndetermination since FTIR is an optical measurement, and elevated absorbances from interference can significantly \nimpact the analyzer\u2019s ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration).  Past EPA \nguidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for the purposes of normalizing data. \n \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2.  ( Tables 1 & 2 ).  EPA\u2019s \ncalculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four reports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the \ndetermination of the proposed measurement limit.   \n \nWe propose revisiting the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard directive of using MDC#2 \ncalculated results to determine an appropriate aggregated emissions limit. \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Discussion \nIn the proposed rule, the value of multiple chemical species are summed to determine compliance with a limit that \nis based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration. As such, and values included in the \nsummation must be corrected to this basis.  Therefore, we believe it is logical that for the purposes of setting a \nfloor that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to match before including them in \nthe sum.  From the reports included in this review, the average combined correction factor results in an increase \nof 22% to the results.  However, we recognize that this is a source specific correction factor depending on the \nmoisture and oxygen content native to the source.  As such, attempting to normalize the emissions limit based on \nadjusted results can have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions.  Given the variability, we \npropose taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating the aggregated emissions limit.   \n \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those cases the individual \nsources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table.  Three reports were excluded due to the variety of \ntesting conditions that included abnormally high or low oxygen and moisture concentrations. \n \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) determined by separately \naveraging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average correction factor for each.  These average factors \nwere then combined for a total correction factor.  A second calculation determines the total correction factor for \neach source, then looks at an average of these bulk correction factors.  Both calculations are presented in Table 3.  \nNotably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the \naverage of total factors from each report.   \n \n\nResult of adjustments  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the determination, and accounting for the corrections that must be applied to all \ndata for the purposes of summation, our analysis shows a standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 \nppmvd @7% O2 formaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O2 for acetaldehyde.  We propose that this should be \nconsidered for the purposes of setting an aggregated emissions limit, and there should be strict adherence to an \nappropriate method for calculating MDLs in the reports submitted. \nPlease contact us at (256) 351-0121 or via email at Jordan.Laster@alliancetg.com if you have any questions or \nneed additional information.   \nSincerely, \nJordan Laster \nSenior Vice President \nAlliance Technical Group \n\n"

(Submitted electronically at http://www.regulations.gov\n) \n \nRE: Comments of the National Lime Association on: Supplemental Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking : National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  Amendments , Docket ID No. EPA-\nHQ- OAR-2017-0015, RIN 2060- AV59  \n Dear Sir or Madam:  \n \nThe National Lime Association (NLA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s \nSupplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments  (\u201cProposed Rule\u201d), 89 Fed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. \n9, 2024). NLA is the trade association for manufacturers of high calcium quicklime, dolomitic quicklime, dead -burned dolomitic lime, and hydrated lime, collectively referred to as \u201clime.\u201d \nLime provides cost-effective solutions to many of society\u2019s manufacturing and environmental needs. Lime is a chemical without substitute, providing solutions to many of society\u2019s environmental problems. Lime is a n important ingredient in many other manufacturing processes \nand industries. It is used in the steel m anufacturing process, road building, and the creation of \nother building products like mortar and plaster. Lime is also a critical component in environmental compliance for many industries, as it is used to purify water and scrub  air \npollutants from stack e missions.  \n \nNLA acknowledges the efforts that EPA has made to improve the Proposed Rule from \nthe prior proposal (the \u201cJanuary 2023 Proposed Rule\u201d ), and these improvements will be \ndiscussed in detail in the comments below. NLA continues to believe, however, that the proposal is unnecessary and flawed in significant underlying ways. These comments reflect NLA\u2019s major \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 2 concerns, as well as more technical issues and corrections.1 Major concerns include the \nfollowing:  \n \n1. The Clean Air Act does not require EPA to regulate additional hazardous air pollutants in \nthis proceeding, and EPA should have determined that such a regulation is unnecessary.  \n \n2. EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  will impose billi ons of dollars in economic costs on the lime \nindustry with  minimal benefits. In addition, not only will the Proposed Rule  impose \ntremendous costs, but it will also cause more environmental harm than good.  \n3. EPA should not have sought to set MACT floors for any of the HAPs addressed in the \nProposed Rule , because no lime industry source is controlling for any of these HAPs, and \nthus there are no true \u201cbest performers\u201d in terms of emissions.  \n4. Any standard for HCl should be a health- based standard pursuant to Clean Air Act \nsection 112(d)(4) . NLA commends EPA for seeking comment on this approach but  \nbelieves it should have been the proposed approach. \n \n5. NLA commends EPA for proposing a n intra-quarry variability f actor  (IQV)  for mercury \nemissions but  believes that the data compels a higher  IQV factor . \n \n6. NLA commends EPA for proposing an aggregated organic HAP standard, but believes the proposed standard requires correction . \n \n7. EPA should withdraw its proposed dioxins/furans ( D/F) standard and either collect \nadditional data on D/F emissions in the lime industry before proceeding with a new \nemissions standard or provide the  work practice or alternative compliance method \npreviously requested by NLA .  \n \nThese and other concerns are addressed in detail below.  \n PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nEPA promulgated the National Emis sion Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for \nLime Manufacturing Plants F inal R ule two decades ago . 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080- 7083. In doing so, \nEPA  noted that: \"the purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health by reducing \nemissions of HAP f rom lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394, 395 (Jan. 5, 2004). EPA \ncarefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector, and regulated HAP emissions by establishing a particulate matter (PM) standard as a surrogate for non- volatile and semi- volatile metal HAP s. \nEPA  fulfilled  its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibil ity Act and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA)  by reaching out to small lime companies, \nperforming extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a small \nbusiness panel with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to identify  less burdensome \n \n1 Some of the comments herein mirror comments included in NLA\u2019s comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \ndated Feb. 21, 2023 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015 -0166) . NLA incorporates those comments and their appendices \nherein by reference, but some of the  points  are repeated here for ease of review . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 3 alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s  regulatory objectives. EPA  also provided a 60- day \ncomment period.  \n \nEPA\u2019s  focus was on protecting public health by reducing HAP emissions  with controls , \nbut only if such controls were \u201cnecessary. \u201d EPA considered, but expressly rejected , regulating \nother HAPs, including the ones at issue in this rulemaking. For example, EPA determined that :  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions f rom lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the \nauthority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is \nnecessary because HCl is a \u201chealth threshold pollutant\u201d and HCl levels emitted from lime \nkilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety.  \n \n69 Fed. Reg. at 397. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was successful in balancing its obligations under the CAA to protect \npublic health while only imposing controls that were \u201cnecessary.\u201d This is evidenced by the fact that the rule was not challenged by the lime industry nor by any environmental groups.  \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA  issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(6) and (f)(2), a.k.a. the \u201crisk and technology review \u201d (RTR).  Here EPA found that : \u201crisks \nare acceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 44960 (July 24, 2020) . EPA further \ndetermined that: \u201cThere are no develop ments in practices, p rocesses, or control technologies that \nnecessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id .  \n \nEPA took a completely different approach in the January 2023 Proposed Rule , and \nlargely continues this approach in the current Proposed Rule . In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \nEPA proposed extremely stringent requirements that would have imposed enormous costs on the \nlime industry. After this was pointed out in comments by NLA and its members, and by the Small Business Administration  (SBA), EPA agreed that it needed to perform a more detailed \nanalysis of the cost impacts of the rule on small businesses. EPA and SBA convened a review \npanel under the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Enforcement Act (SBREFA), which was held on August 3, 2023. Aft er the panel procedure, EPA proceeded to issue the current Proposed \nRule, which incorporates many of the recommendations made through the panel process.  \n NLA commends EPA for participating in the SBREFA review  and for responding to \nconcerns raised during the process . NLA also notes that EPA\u2019s estimate of the costs of the new \nProposed Rule are more realistic and  much higher than those estimated for the January 2023 \nProposed Rule. These high costs, coupled with EPA\u2019s repeated determinations that the existing rule presents acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety, even with no new standards, are \nwhat has led NLA , as well as the Small Business Panel,  to ur ge EPA to identify as many ways to \nminimize the impact of the Proposed Rule on the lime industry as possible. \n EPA is not pursuing this rulemaking process because of risks to the public or the \nenvironment, but because of court decisions  that are imposing unnecessary  deadlines and \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 4 substantive requirements that are nowhere found in \u00a7 112(d)(6) of the Clean Air Act .2 Despite \nthe fact that EPA has consistently determined for over two decades that risks from lime plant \nemissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and thus that additional MACT regulations for the lime industry sector are unnecessary , EPA  is pushing to complete this \nrulemaking as soon as possible because of  a court -ordered deadline of June 30, 2024, for the \npromulgation of a final rule to regulate four additional pollutants whether EPA believes new standards are necessary or not.  TECHNICAL BACKGROUND  \n The Proposed Rule continues to reflect a lack of technical understanding of  the lime \nindustry in several important respects . Below is a discussion providing technical background on \nhow lime kilns and their HAP emissions interact. Specifically, the discussion below relates to the four additional HAP s addressed in the Proposed Rule : HCl (hydrogen chloride), Hg (mercury), \noHAP (organic Hazardous Air Pollutants), and D/F (dioxins and furans).   \n Lime  kilns differ substantially from  traditional fuel combustion sources and  kilns from \nother industrial sectors in how HAPs are emitted and controlled. For example, fossil fuel -fired \nboilers and heaters and  tunnel kilns used to manufacture brick or ceramics exhibit significantly \ndifferent  emissions formation phenomenon and emissions gas stream characteristics from those \nfound in lime kilns , and thus basing assumptions on performance of these devices, as EPA \nappears to have done, has led  to errors in analysis, and the failure to consider important factors \nthat will affect cost and performance of air pollution control devices in lime plants .\n3 The \noperation of these non- lime sources differ substantially from the operation of lime plants, in \nparticular with respect to the temperature s necessary to achieve calcination  in a lime kiln  and the \nlong- life requirements of lime plant design and operation near a quarry. These non- lime sources \nare further  not involved in continuously operating process es in a lime plant that have many tons \nper hour of a circulating product load. These operational realities, formation mechanisms, and exhaust gas stream characteristics are very dif ferent  for a lime kiln than for a typical combustion \ndevice or tunnel kiln. Comparison with cement kilns can also lead to erroneous conclusions, because cement kilns differ substantially from lime kilns due to the variety of feedstocks and fuels, and the differences in processes . Below is a brief discussion for each newly regulated \nHAP.  \n \n\u2022 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) .  The formation of HCl is incidental to the lime production \nprocess and is a function of the temperatures required to make lime, the fuels used for their energy value, and constituents found in the raw material input (limestone) to the \n \n2 Despite meeting its obligations of CAA \u00a7 112(d)(6) and (f)(2) by issuing a final  RTR rule in 2020, EPA takes the \nposition that it must issue a new rule following the decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA , \n955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (\u201cLEAN \u201d). As set forth in these comments,  EPA misinterprets LEAN  to require a \nrevised standard here despite EPA\u2019s RTR findings of no residual risks or available new technologies. Further, even \nif EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN  was correct, NLA asserts that the LEAN case was wrongly decided and should be \nrevisited and reversed by the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court.  \n3 NLA recognizes  that EPA in the Supplemental Proposed Rule has substantially revised its costs estimates to better \nalign with industry\u2019s cost estimates. Nevertheless, there remain  substantial technical uncertainties  as to whether  any \nof the candidate MACT technologies will achieve the proposed limit s and therefore even EPA\u2019s increased cost \nestimates incorporate significant economic uncertainty.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 5 kilns. Given that the lime kiln process is alkaline in nature, its environment already \noffers an inherent reduction of acid gas emissions, including HCl, without any additional controls. The proposed MACT standard starts from a floor that is based on the few lowest emitting sources and then proceeds to require the installation of expensive controls to attempt to reduce very low levels to even lower levels without conclusive data on the feasibility  of those controls.   \n \n\u2022 Mercury.   Emissions of mercury are low from lime kilns. Mercury  can be emitted in \neither its elemental or ionic (oxidized) form at ratios that will require extensive study and design controls for lime kilns subject to the rule. Unlike typical combustion systems, where emitted mercury  is solely a function of levels  in fuels, a lime kiln also \ncan see contributions to emissions from trace levels of mercury that naturally occur in limestone. The large quarries  at lime plants  have natural variability in such tra ce \ncompounds. Given the requirement that large volumes of stone are necessary to make lime and the long-term capital investment needed to build and operate a lime plant, most lime plants are located near their limestone source with decades -long \noperational and mining plans. NLA produced and provided to EPA significant volumes of data on mercury, and demonstrated how EPA should apply an int ra-\nquarry variability (IQV) factor to account for variability of mercury in stone feedstocks.    \n \n\u2022 Organic HAPs .  Emissions of organic HAPs from lime kilns are very low in quantity \nand in the number of individual HAPs. These organic HAPs can be formed incidentally during combustion in the kiln  and can also be formed by miniscule \namounts of naturally occurring organics contained in limestone that decompose at lower temperatures and randomly form organic HAPs. To address these very small amounts of organic HAPs, EPA previously proposed to set a MACT floor for total hydrocarbons (THC) as a surrogate. EPA has now proposed a superior aggregated oHAP approach, although, as detailed below, it requires some important corrections .   \n \n\u2022 Dioxins and Furans.  Dioxins and furans ( D/F) are emitted in extremely low \nquantities  from lime kilns , and in some cases are not detectable at all . Many lime \nkilns affected by this rule may  not have detectable levels of D/F and yet will be \nsubject to burdensome testing in perpetuity. The formation of D/F is incidental in a lime kiln where organics and chlorides are  available to form barely detectable levels \nof D/F  (in the part s per billion range) in some kilns. Despite EPA\u2019s own studies and \ndocumentation in the prior Lime MACT and RTR rulemakings confirming the extremely low level s of D/F from lime kilns, EPA has proposed the most stringent \nlimit available .   \n       \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 6 GENERAL ISSUES  \n \nI. THE CLEAN AIR ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE  EPA TO REGULATE \nADDITIONAL  HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS IN THIS PROCEEDING  \n \nThere are two key reasons why EPA should not be engaged in this rulemaking. First, any \nlawsuits or petitions demanding revisions to the underlying lime MACT standard are time -\nbarred, and thus EPA is under no legal obligation to engage in this rulemaking. Second, even if \nnot time -barred, it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d in this residual risk and technology (RTR) proceeding to \nissue four new  MACT standard s. \n \nA. EPA Should Not Have Undertaken to Rewrite the Lime Manufacturing \nMACT Standard Because All Parties Are Time- Barred from Challenging \nThat Standard  \n EPA is undertaking this revision to the existing lime MACT standard in this RTR \nproceeding because environmental petitioners requested that it do so following the DC Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Louisiana Environmental Action Network  v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(\u201cLEAN \u201d). However,  environmental petitioners are time -barred from challenging the underlying \nlime MACT standard because they failed to do so within 60 days  following promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard in 2004, and thus there is no legal obligation for EPA to undertake this \nrulemaking.  \n \nSection 307(b) of the Clean Air Act requires any party to initiate a challenge for EPA\u2019s \nfailure to set hazardous air pollutant (HAP) standards within 60 days from promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(b)(1). This requirement is juri sdictional, and a court \ncannot waive or lengthen it. Med . Waste Inst. & Energy Recovery Council v. EPA , 645 F.3d 420, \n427 (D.C. Cir. 2011); NRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The LEAN  court \nacknowledged the argument but  did not address it o r rule on its merits.  This limitation on \njudicial review of EPA actions serves an \u201cimportant reason: to enforce repose so that the rulemaking process is not crippled by surprise challenges to matters that were rightfully presumed settled  . . .\u201d EME Homer City Generation, L .P. v. EPA, 696 F.3d 7, 38 (D.C. Cir. \n2012), rev\u2019d on other grounds , 572 U.S. 489 (2014) (Rogers, J., dissenting). Further, this \njurisdictional timeline protects the regulated industry by allowing industry to plan for compliance obligatio ns. Cf. Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA , 647 F.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (observing \nthat the CAA\u2019s strict deadlines for completing the steps to promulgate ambient air quality standards, and the limitation on stays pending petitions for reconsideration in CAA section \n307(d)(7)(B), are evide nce of \u201ca strong congressional desire that the procedure for establishing \nair quality standards be completed expeditiously and with considerable finality\u201d).  \n \nHere, the underlying lime MACT standard was promulgated in 2004, 69 Fed. Reg. 394 \n(Jan. 5, 2004). The challenge to EPA\u2019s RTR rule  (challenging EPA\u2019s decision not to regulate \nadditional HAPs in the original MACT rule)  was not filed until September 22, 2020, over 16 \nyears beyond the 60- day judicial review period established by Congress. Accordingly, any \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 7 challenge to the existing MACT standard would be time -barred, and thus EPA is under no legal \nobligation to initiate this rulemaking.4  \n \nFurthermore, the time bar argument is stronger in the context of the lime MACT standard \nthan it was in the LEAN  case, because all the pollutants addressed in this new rulemaking were \nexplicitly addressed in the original lime MACT rulemaking in 2004. This is not a case in which HAPs were ignored or inadvertently omitted, but rather a case in which EPA specifically  decided \nthat regulation was not necessary, a decision that was not challenged at the time. \n Thus, for HC l, in the 2004 MACT rule, EPA explicitly  performed a review under CAA \nsection 112(d)(4). Below is what EPA stated in the final rule preamble:  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions from lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the authority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is necessary because HCl is a \u2018\u2018health threshold pollutant,\u2019\u2019 and HCl levels emitted fr om \nlime kilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety. See generally, \n67 FR 78054\u2013057. As explained there, the risk analysis sought to assure that emissions from every source in the category result in exposures less than the threshol d level even \nfor an individual exposed at the upper end of the exposure distribution. The upper end of the exposure distribution is calculated using the \u2018\u2018high end exposure estimate,\u2019\u2019 defined as a plausible estimate of individual exposure for those persons at the upper end of the exposure distribution, conceptually above the 90th percentile, but not higher than the individual in the population who has the highest exposure. We believe that assuring protection to persons at the upper end of the exposure dist ribution is consistent with the \n\u2018\u2018ample margin of safety\u2019\u2019 requirement in section 112(d)(4). In the proposed rule, we published the results of the risk analysis on which we based this decision. More information on the risk analysis may be found in the publ ished proposed rule (67 FR \n78054\u201378057) and in the docket. We received only one comment on our risk analysis. \n 69 Fed. Reg. 398.\n5  \n \nEPA explicitly state d that it was  making this determination under the authority of section \n112(d)(4) \u2014it is not a matter of EPA  simply deciding that it did not need to regulate HCl because \nof low risk. Because EPA explicitly found in 2004 that HCl was a threshold pollutant, and that the criteria of section 112(d)(4) were satisfied \u2014and no one challenged the rule \u2014any legal \nchallenge to that determination is now time -barred.  \n  EPA also addressed mercury in the 2004 rule preamble, choosing not to issue a mercury \nstandard because: \u201cThe only control technique would reflect control of the raw materials and/or fossil fuels. This control is not duplicable or replicable. We also determined that an emissions \n \n4 To the extent that the LEAN  court could be deemed to have ruled against the time bar argument, NLA respectfully \nsubmits that the case was wrongly decided, for the reasons stated in these comments. The decision was not appealed \nby any party. NLA was not a party, but rather an amicus in that case , and thus was not able to appeal the decision.  \n5 See docket items EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0767 and EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0768 for more information on \nthe extensive risk assessment performed for HCl in the original lime MACT rule.  NLA incorporates those \ndocuments into these comments by reference.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 8 limit for mercury based on a beyond- the-MACT -floor option is not justified after consideration \nof the cost, energy, and non- environmental impacts.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 398. EPA received no adverse \ncomments on this approach and the final rule was not challenged.  \n \n For organics and dioxins/furans, EPA\u2019s technical contractor explained the decision not to \nissue standards in a memorandum in the docket. EPA \u2019s contractor  stated that there was \nessentially no data suggesting organics were emitted . The contractor stated that after a review of \nemissions test data, \u201c[o]nly one test reported any emissions of organic HAPs from lime manufacturing\u2026\u201d Docket No. A -95-41, Item No. II-B-121 at 1. For dioxins and furans, the \ncontractor stated : \u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners a re well -documented, but are shown \nto be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not collected in this search.\u201d Id. \n  Thus, EPA addressed all these HAPs in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and its \ndeterminations were unchallenged until this effort to bootstrap such challenges into the RTR rulemaking. EPA should rely on its prior reasonable decisions , should withdraw the Proposed \nRule  and should reject any effort to bring challenges as  legally time -barred.  \n \nB. EPA Should Not Revise the MACT Standard for Lime Manufacturing \nBecause it is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d to Do So, Given EPA\u2019s RTR Findings of No \nResidual Risks or  Available New Technologies  \n \nThe LEAN court held that \u201c\u2026because the Act necessitates section 112 compliant \nemission standards for each source category, and section 112(d)(6) requires EPA at least every \neight years to review and revise emissions standards \u2018as necessary,\u2019 EPA\u2019s section 112(d)(6)  \nreview of a source category\u2019s emission standard must address all listed air toxics the source category emits.\u201d LEAN , 955 F.3d at 1091. U nder that decision, EPA must \u201c address\u201d  whether any \nfurther regulation of listed air toxics is \u201c necessary ,\u201d in its discr etion. For lime manufacturing , \nEPA already \u201caddressed\u201d this in 2004, and found, in promulgating the lime RTR standard, that \nthere were no residual risks  and no technological advances of note, and therefore  no reason to \nrevise the MACT standard for the source category. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44965- 66. EPA\u2019s own \nscientific assessment confirmed this determination in 2020 when it found lime emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety. Hence, EPA in its discretion may, and in NLA\u2019s opinion, must reasonably conclude that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d to revise the MACT standard any further, consistent with LEAN.\n6 \n \n6 Notwithstanding LEAN,  the plain language of s ection 112(d)(6) requires only technology review. Therefore, \nsection 112(d)(6) cannot be used to address  unregulated HAPs from a MACT standard \u2013  other provisions of the \nstatute ( sections 112(d)(2) and (3)) fulfill that purpose. Section 112(d)(6) is meant to be a review only of any \ntechnological advances in the eight years after promulgation of a M ACT standard, and nothing more. Courts have \nagreed with this reading of the Clean Air Act and  have found that the focus of the section 112(d)(6) periodic review \nis on new developments in pollution control or prevention technologies since the prior promulgation. See, e.g ., Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n for Surface Finishing v. EPA , 795 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that section 112(d)(6) provides for a \n\u201crecurring technology review\u201d to determine \u201cwhether standards should be tightened in view of developments in \ntechnologies and practices since the standard\u2019s promulgation or las t revision, and, in particular, the cost and \nfeasibility of developments and corresponding emissions savings\u201d); Blue Ridge Env tl.

EPA Should Consider Factors Including Cost  and Acceptable Risk  to \nDetermine that the Proposed Rule Is Not \u201c Necessary. \u201d \nNLA believes that, consistent with Clean Air Act Section 112(d) (2), 42 U.S.C. Section \n7412(d)(2) , EPA has substantial discretion to consider all relevant factors to determine whether \nstandards for unregulated HAPs are \u201cnecessary\u201d in an RTR rulemaking, including but not limited \nto: what proportion of the affected sources are actually known to emit the HAP; how close to a \ndetection limit the concentrations are; whether the concentrations are likely to be reduced \nsignificantly by imposing an additional technol ogy-based limitation; whether the technology that \nis in effect for HAPs already regulated will also control the \u201cmissing HAP\u201d; and how cost  \neffective additional controls would be (since s ection 112(d)(6) allows costs to be taken into \naccount).  \n The costs  of this rule are significant . EPA\u2019s own cost analysis states that this rule will \nimpose cost s on 34 major sources of  between $2.01 billion and $2.43 billion. This includes \ncapital costs of $1.04 billion in year one, plus an additional annual cost of $174 million \nthereafter . These impacts are monumental for an industry that the U.S. Geological Service \nestimates receives  $2.3 billion in annual revenues.  \n \nEPA says that this rule \u201cis expected to increase the price of lime and reduce lime \nproduction and consumption from baseline levels.\u201d EPA  states  that under the rule, the price of \nlime will increase by 5.9%,  domestic production is estimated to decline  by 1.5% , imports are \nestimated to increase by 12.3% , and exports are expected to decline  by 6.7% . NLA believes that \nthese impacts are understated, because lime plants will also need to allocate a significant portion \nof their own lime production for use in dry sorbent injection systems to control HCl emissions. Rather than causing a 1.5% reduction in lime produced, if the lime allocated for HCl control is counted in that figure , reductions  in lime production could be several times that amount \nnationwide. There is evidence in the record that lime plants may need to use as much as 8% of their own hydrated lime product to meet the HCl standard. See  Greer Lime Company Comments , \nFeb. 21, 2023, at p. 5. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0167. \n EPA attempts to justify these costs by asserting that:  \n \nThis industry is regulated by EPA because pollutants emitted from lime manufacturing facilities are considered to cause or contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health \u2026The proposed requirements are \nbeing considered to address unacceptable health risks linked to emissions from lime manufacturing facilities and to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health.  \n See Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) \nat p. 45.

See Surface Finishing, 795 \nF.3d at 8- 9; Ass\u2019n of Battery Recyclers  v. EPA , 716 F.3d 667,  673-74 (D.C. Cir. 2013) .  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 10  \nThese statement s are demonstrably false, and directly contradict EPA\u2019s own repeated \nfindings that emissions from the lime industry are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety. Lime industry emissions are not endangering public health, nor are those  emissions levels \ncausing unacceptable health risks to the public. EPA must acknowledge this error and correct it in the final rule.  \n \n The costs of the rule cited by EPA are understated because they analyze the pollutants \none at a time and do not consider the m as a group. For some pollutants, high temperatures are \nrequired to reduce emissions. For other pollutants, controls will not be effective above a certain \ntemperature range. Lime plants that need to control multiple pollutants will need to spend \nsignificant resources on both heating and cooling at the same operation. These costs are not \nadequately reflected in EPA \u2019s analysis.  \n \nThe benefits of the rule are minimal, and in fact  are so negligible that  EPA  does not even \nattempt to quantify them: \u201cThe EPA did not monetize  the benefits from the estimated emission \nreductions of HAP associated with this final action. The EPA currently does not have sufficient methods to monetize benefits associated with HAP, HAP reductions and risk reductions for this \nrulemaking.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 9,099 (Feb. 9, 2024).   \n In addition, 97.7%  of HAP emission reductions claimed by EPA  come from HCl controls \namounting to reductions of  884 tons per year  (out of 905 tons per year total for all four HAPs) . \nBut EPA  has already determined  that even with no HCl controls : \u201cThe results of the exposure \nassessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production \nfacilities are well below the health threshold value  *** Furthermore, no significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. \u201d 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. \n2002). That is why EPA  found, twice, that risks from lime manufacturing emissions are \n\u201cacceptable with an ample margin of safety ,\u201d and thus additional controls would not yield \nsignificant benefits .  \n Reductions of other HAPs are even less significant. EPA\u2019s own analysis demonstrates \nthat the Proposed Rule , if implemented, would decrease organic  HAPs by only 20 tons/year in \ntotal. M ercury w ould be reduced by only a fraction of a ton ( 0.32 tons/year ). Dioxins and f urans \nreductions are almost too small to measure at 0.000000047 tons/year. The HAP reductions are so small that EPA said that: \u201cthere is no value reported in this table for monetized benefits and the \nnet benefits of this rule are unclear.\u201d Although EPA claims that \u201cthe proposed changes will have \nbeneficial effects on air quality and public health for populations exposed to emissions from lime \nmanufacturing facilities,\u201d this claim of public health benefits is contradicted by EPA \u2019s own risk \nassessment which found that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety.  \n \n2. Because The Rule Will Cause More Environmental Harm than Benefit, It  \nIs Not \u201cNecessary ,\u201d And Lacks a Rational Basis  \n \nThe Proposed Rule  will, on a net basis, do more environmental harm than good. While \nthe rule may  result in some  minimal reduction in HAPs that EPA has already determined a re well \nwithin acceptable levels , the rule will c ause a significant and unnecessary:  (1) increase in \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 11 greenhouse gas emissions and other air emissions ; (2) wast e of lime products that could be used \nto address other environmental problems; (3) addition  of waste streams for landfills ; and (4) \nwaste of water and energy resources to run unnecessary pollution control devices.  \n \nTo meet the requirements of reducing organics emissions by as few as 20 tons per year, \nEPA predicts  that several lime plants will need to install expensive and unnecessary regenerative \nthermal oxidizers (RTOs) to control such emissions. RTOs run on natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, the combustion of which generates greenhouse gas es. The direct result of this new \nregulation will be that tens of thousands of tons of CO\n2 will be unnecessarily released into the \natmosphere, contributing to climate change. This is the equivalent of adding thousands of passenger vehicles on America\u2019s roads , but without any passengers. In addition, any natural gas \nunnecessarily consumed in this process would be another wasted resource that could have been \nused for another beneficial purpose such as heating homes, producing cleaner electricity, or storage for future use.  In addition to carbon dioxide, combustion of fuel in RTO s will result in \nthe emission of other pollutants such as NOx and carbon monoxide. \nLime is a valuable resource that can be used for many environmentally beneficial \npurposes. But EPA\u2019s rule would force lime companies to use significant amounts of their own \nproduct to reduce HCl emissions that EPA  has twice found to pose acceptable risk with an ample \nmargin of safety. Dry sorbent injection requires lime to reduce HCl emissions. Instead of using \nthat lime for unneeded HCl emissions  reductions, that same lime could be used to make other \nmuch more significant environmental improvements. For example, two  tons of lime used for flue \ngas desulfurization could reduce SO 2 emissions by one ton. SO 2 is a criteria air pollutant, and \nEPA describes its effects as follows : \nShort-term exposures to SO 2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing \ndifficult. People with asthma, particularly children, are sensitive to these effects of SO 2. \nSO 2 emissions that lead to high concentrations of SO 2 in the air generally also lead to the \nformation of other sulfur oxides (SO x). SO x can react with other compounds in the \natmosphere to form small particles. These particles contribute to particulate matter (PM) \npollution. Small particles  may penetrate deeply into the lungs and in sufficient quantity \ncan contribute to health problems. \n \nSulfur Dioxide Basics | Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Pollution | US EPA \n \nLime is also  used by municipal and other water treatment plants across the United States \nto treat drinking water for the public. In this context, one ton of lime can soften over 450,000 gallons of drinking water. Likewise, lime is  instrumental in treating acid mine drainage f rom \nhistoric mining operations. Lime  neutralizes toxic acid mine drainage by raising its pH levels . \nUsed in this context, one ton of lime can treat  over 5 million gallons of water that will ultimately \nbe discharged into streams and other water bodies.  \n Imposing unnecessary regulations that  waste valuable lime resources in this way will \nhave unintended and detrimental environmental and economic consequences. These include making lime less available in the supply chain for environmentally beneficial uses, increasing the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 12 cost of lime for all users, and causing more lime to be produced than is currently necessary . \nIncreasing lime production will result in an  inefficient use of finite natural resources , including \nwasting limestone quarries  and the fuel used to produce the lime, as well as even more increased \nand unnecessary air emissions.  \n \nEPA\u2019s rule requiring reductions of HAPs by using activated carbon injection (ACI) will \npotentially create a significant new waste stream that will need to be landfilled in the environment. A lime plant that must install ACI may produce tons of additional waste annually. EPA policy should be to minimize waste streams into the environment --not to increase them , \nparticularly where EPA  has already determined that existing air emissions from lime plants are \ncurrently acceptable with an ample margin of safety, even without new standards.  \n Finally, EPA\u2019s own analysis acknowledges  that the imposition of new emissions \nstandards will result in secondary impacts from  projected  controls required for compliance with \nthe proposed standards. EPA expects lime plants to use 1.12 million additional gallons of water per year to address HCl controls with wet packed tower gas absorbers (WPTGAs) . EPA  predicts \nthat s olid waste from WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection, and A ctivated Carbon I njection will \nincrease solid waste by 13,400 tons per year. And finally, EP A states that all types of pollution \ncontrols installed under this rule (including WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers; Activated Carbon Injection; and Heat Exchangers) will collectively use an \nadditional 696 billion  Btu\u2019s of energy annually. According to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s \nEnergy Information Agency, the average ton of coal in the U.S. contains about 20.1 million Btus of energy. This means it would take over 34,000 tons of coal annually to produce that many Btus of energy. See EIA Frequently Asked Questions\n. \n The rule will reduce HAP emissions slightly, but in quantities so small that EPA  was \nunable to quantify the benefits of such reductions. In addition, EPA\u2019s own best available science shows that HAPs do not need to be further reduced to protect public health and the environment. But the rule will also lead inevitably to significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions, wasting of valuable lime products that could be better used to solve other environmental challenges, wasting of water and energy resources, and a significant and unnecessary increase in solid waste streams.  For all these reasons, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule is unnecessary and lacks a \nrational  basis  because it will cause more environmental harm than good, andany interpretation of \nthe statute that suggests that EPA is required to promulgate a regulation that causes more environmental harm than benefit also lacks a rational basis . Promulgating the rule as proposed, \nwithout adequately considering costs and environmental impacts, would be arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n3. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because Its Benefits Are De \nMinimis  \n LEAN did not overrule the seminal D.C. Circuit decision of Alabama Power v. Costle , \n636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1979), which held, in the context of the Clean Air Act\u2019s PSD regulations, that every rule  inherently contains a de minimis criterion. So, if regulation of \nadditional HAPs in this potential revised lime RTR proceeding would only have de minimis environmental benefits given the lack of residual risk or technology improvements, it is not \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 13 necessary for EPA to impose additional controls  to \u201caddress\u201d such HAPs. Although EPA has \ntaken the position that section 112(d)(6) does not allow for a de minimis exception7, the U.S. \nSupreme Court has held that the de minimis  doctrine is a legal principle that forms part of the \nestablished background against which all statutes  are enacted. Wisc. Dep\u2019t of Rev. v. William \nWrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992), and this has been subsequently reiterated by the \nD.C. Circuit. New York v. EPA , 443 F.3d 880, 888 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201c de minimis  requirements \nserve to alleviate severe administrative and economic burdens by lifting requirements on \n\u2018minuscule \u2019 emission increases \u201d) (internal quotations omitted).  In this case the benefits of the \nrule as proposed are truly de minimis , as compared to the negative environmental impacts and the \neconomic costs, an d the standards  set are extremely low (in several cases based on levels of non -\ndetection) . EPA should decline to impose these requirements.   \n \n4. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because the HAPs in the Rule \nWere Addressed in the 2004 Rulemaking  \n Another reason that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set standards for additional HAPs \nthrough the rulemaking here is because, as noted above, all the relevant HAPs were addressed in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and EPA expressed clear reasons for its decision not to set standards for them, reasons that went unchallenged. In this case, it is not necessary to \u201cfix\u201d any problem with the original MACT rule, because there is no such problem. This is further confirmed by the conclusion of EPA\u2019s risk assessment, whi ch addressed all these HAPs and \nfound no need to impose additional standards on any of them. \n Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 by adding sections  112(d)(2) and (d)(3) \nwhich require EPA to establish MACT floor standards for existing sources based on the average of the best performing 12% of each industry sector. Congress took this step because it believed that EPA  was too slow in assessing risks and adopting air emissionstandards.. But unlike the \nsituation where risks from industry emissions are unknown, in this case there are two risk assessments and EPA  findings that emissions from the lime industry are acceptable with an \nample margin of safety. Under such circumstances, it is not only \u201cunnecessary\u201d for EPA to issue \nMACT floor standards, but irrational and contrary to the intent of the Act. Issuing standards that \nEPA  knows to be unnecessary to protect the public health and the environment is arbitrary and \ncapricious and cannot be c onsistent with what Congress intended in the Clean Air Act.  \n \nCongress clearly expressed its view in Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(f)(2) that additional \nregulation in the absence of risk is unnecessary. That section addresses the situation where risks are known (as in this rulemaking) following an appropriate scientific risk assessment by EPA. It \ninstructs EPA  to promulgate additional standards only if required to provide an ample margin of \nsafety to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect : \n *** the Administrator shall, within 8 years after promulgation of s tandards for each \ncategory or subcategory of sources pursuant to subsection (d), promulgate standards for \nsuch category or subc ategory if promulgation of such standards is required in order to \nprovide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section  \n \n7 See e.g. , EPA Response to Comments for Portland Cement Industry NESHAP, 64 Fed. Reg. 31898, 31911 (June \n14, 1999).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 14 *** or to prevent , taking into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant \nfactors, an adverse environmental effect.  \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(f)(2).  \n \nYet EPA found as recently as 2020 that risks  from emissions of the lime manufacturing \nindustry are acceptable with an ample margin of safety : \n In this action, we are finalizing our proposed determination that risks from the source \ncategory are acceptable, the standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth, and more stringent standards are not necessary to prevent an adverse environmental effect.  \n 85 Fed. Reg. 44,963 (July 24, 2020).  \n \nAccordingly, since EPA\u2019s own scientific findings demonstrate that promulgating new \nstandards is not \u201crequired\u201d to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health, there is \nno statutory requirement for EPA to revise the lime manufacturing sector\u2019s MACT standards  by \nadding these  four additional HAPs.  This view is also shared by many Members of Congress, \nincluding several  on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who stated that:  \n \nSince EPA has already found that such standards are not required to provide an ample \nmargin of safety, new regulations are not \u201cnecessary.\u201d EPA should withdraw the \nproposed rule and reiterate that new regulations are not necessary in this instance to \ncomply with the LEAN v. EPA decision and \u00a7112 of the Clean Air Act. \n Congressional Letter to EPA Administrator Regan, Dec. 8, 2023, at pp. 2 -3. \n \nFinally, the LEAN decision must be read in the context of the Supreme Court \u2019s recent \nopinion in West Virginia v EPA , which was decided post -LEAN . In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that for \u201cmajor questions\u201d \u2013 like the scope of EPA\u2019s authority to issue greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants under s ection 111(d) of the Clean Air Act \u2013 EPA must \ndemonstrate that Congress gave it specific authority for its regulatory action. West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022) . Surely, the question of w hether EPA can reach back decades in an \nRTR proceeding ( under s ections 112(f) and 112(d)(6) ) and  find that a provision of the Clean Air \nAct that was designed to require review for technological advances somehow compels EPA to reopen a MACT standard (issued under s ections 112(d)(2) and (3)) is a major one. Congress did \nnot give EPA that authority. Accordingly, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  is unlawful. \n II. EPA COULD NOT LEGALLY ESTABLISH MACT FLOORS FOR ANY OF THE \nPOLLUTANTS ADDRESSED IN THIS RULEMAKING  \n \nEPA states that: \u201cThese MACT standards are based on emissions levels that are already \nbeing achieved by the best -controlled and lowest -emitting sources in an industry.\u201d Regulatory \nImpact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emissions \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 15 Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) at p. 46. \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0208. \n \nTo the contrary, none  of the sources in the lime industry are controlled for these HAPs, \nand therefore none of them can fairly be considered the \u201cbest controlled.\u201d The sources cited by \nEPA are the \u201clowest emitting sources .\u201d But the Clean Air Act does  not say \u201clowest emittin g;\u201d \ninstead it says \u201cbest perform ing.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A). As noted above, NLA does not \nbelieve that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set any new emissions standards for the lime industry in \nthis rulemaking. However, if EPA decides  to set standards for additional HAPs, NLA believes \nthat EPA may not establish MACT floors for  HAPs when there are no current controls in place at \nany source. Rather, EPA must consider costs and other factors in setting standards.  \n \nNo lime plants currently use any add- on control technology to control emissions of any of \nthe four HAPs involved in this rulemaking. Differences in emissions are not the result of \ncontrols, but rather result from differences in feedstocks (stone and fuel), and operation of lime plant equipment. NLA believes that it is anomalous, and contrary to what was intended when the Clean Air Act air toxics provisions were written, to suggest that a source with lower \nconcentrations of a HAP in stone in its quarry (for e xample) is somehow the \u201cbest performer\u201d in \nterms of controlling emissions of that HAP. Thus, NLA believes that it is improper to set a \nMACT floor based on such emissions data. NLA is aware that EPA takes a contrary view, but the facts of this case\u2014in which stringent standards are being imposed even with a finding of acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety for HAPs that are not being controlled by any source \u2014justify a reconsideration of EPA\u2019s position.  \n Instead of setting MACT floors, EPA should have approached all four HAPs using the \nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(d)(2), which provides:  \n \nEmissions standards promulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or existing \nsources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the maximum degree of reduction in \nemissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to this section (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non- air quality health and \nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable for new  or \nexisting sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies \u2026 \n NLA does not believe that this point is inconsistent with  National Lime Ass'n v. E.P.A , \n233 F.3d 625 (D.C. Cir. 2000) , or Sierra Club v. E.P.A ., 479 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 2007) . In those \ncases, EPA set a \u201cfloor\u201d of no control where no technology controls were in place. The court held that the statu te requires an emissions standard for each HAP, even where no technology \ncontrols are in place. However, in neither case did the court rule that EPA must set a MACT \nfloor to  set the standard, nor did it give guidanc e to EPA on how to do so. In Sierra Club v. EPA , \nNo. 15- 1487 (D.C. Cir. July 6, 2018) , industry petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rule would require \nraw material substitution . The Court noted again that the statute requires standards for all HAPs, \neven if emissions differences are due to differences in feedstocks, but goes on to state that it was \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 16 not necessary to rule on those grounds, because EPA\u2019s standard did not require raw material \nsubstitution in the first place.  \n NLA believes that EPA should consider the \u201c cost of achieving such emission reduction, \nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements \u201d in setting \nstandards when  there are no technology controls in place. Indeed, the concept of the MACT floor \nis that a percentage of the source category can  achieve a certain  level of control , typically with \nthe use of already -installed air pollution control technology. This is why the statu te refers to such \nsources as \u201cbest performers.\u201d The id ea was that it was fair to require additional sources to apply \nthe same controls as the \u201cbest performers\u201d  because the \u201cbest performers\u201d were presumably able \nto bear the costs of those controls. Differences in the makeup of onsite quarries is not \u201cperformance,\u201d it is  pure chance .  \n As explained above, the costs of the Proposed Rule are extremely high, and the \nenvironmental benefits are extremely low, and even negative when energy use , additional carbon \ndioxide emissions, and generation of additional wastes are considered . EPA should withdraw the \nProposed Rule and abandon its MACT floor approach to the lime industry, and instead should set standards that are protective of human health and the environment, without imposing unnecessary costs on the lime industry, including its small businesses.  \n \nIII. EPA \u2019S PROPOSED RULE VIOLATES CLEAN AIR ACT  SECTION 307 \n A. EPA Violated the Clean Air Act by Not Publishing the Proposed Rule Language in the Federal Register  \n EPA proposed this rule\u2014as it also did with the January 2023 Proposed Rule\u2014without \npublishing any proposed rule language in the Federal Register . Rather than  setting forth \nproposed language, EPA instead included a redline version of the current regulations in the docket, to indicate  what the proposed revisions would be. This docket entry is not a lawful \nsubstitute for publishing actual rule language \u2013 it is a rule that the lime industry must comply \nwith, not the preamble, and not a document tucked away in the record for the rulemaking. Failing to publish such language means that commenters do not have a meaningful opportunity to submit comments on the Proposed Rule. Failure to publish the rule language in the Federal Register  also \nviolates s ection 307(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act which requires:  \n \n\u2026any rule to which this subsection applies, notice of proposed rulemaking shall be \npublished in the Federal Register\u2026 \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3). \n \nWhen proposing a rule, EPA must properly publish proposed rule language in the \nFederal Register . The comment period for a Proposed Rule cannot begin until the actual  \nproposed rule language is published in the Federal Re gister . \n  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 17 B. EPA Violated the Statement of Basis and Purpose Requirement by Failing to \nInclude a Summary of the Major Legal Interpretations and Policy \nConsiderations Underlying the Proposed Rule   \n \nThe 2024 Proposed Rule reverses important determinations made in the original lime \nMACT standard issued in 2004 without mention, comment,  or explanation by EPA . Although it \nsolicits comment on the concept of adopting a health- based emission limit (HBEL) for HCl, it \nstill proposes to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl  without providing details and an \nexplanation of why EPA  is reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nand that a health -based  standard is appropriate, and that no HCl standard is needed at all . This is \na reversal of EPA\u2019s longstanding twenty -year finding established in the 2004 MACT standard \nand was not addressed in either the 2023 or the 2024 Proposed Rule s.8  \n \nIn the preamble of the 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA states that: \u201c In response to the 2017 \nquestionnaire, we received HCL emissions data that EPA did not have when we developed the 2004 NESHAP. Therefore, we are proposing a standard pursuant to CAA section 112(d) (2) and \n(d)(3), as described further in section IV.A.1 of this preamble.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 809. While these two sentences are each factually true, taken together without explanation, the y are misleading . \nThat is because they  imply cause and effect \u2014i.e. , that the reason EPA  is now promulgating \nMACT floor standards for HCl is because it obtained new emissions  information that justified \nsuch regulation that was  not avai lable in 2004. This is simply not the case. EPA had ample HCl \ninformation for its initial MACT rulemaking when it determined that: \n The results of the exposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production facilities are well below the health threshold value. Additionally, the threshold values, for which the RfC and AEGL values were determined to be appropriate values, were not exceeded when considering conservative estimates of \nexposure resulting from lime kiln emissions as well as considering background exposures to HCl and therefore, represent an ample margin of safety. Furthermore, no signific ant or \nwidespread adverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. Therefore, under \nauthority of section 112(d)(4), we have determined that further control of HCl emissions from lime manufacturing plants is not necessary.  \n 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. 2002).  \n \nEPA has not identified any new data from the 2017 ICR that is so fundamentally different \nto justify  regulation of HCl from lime manufacturing plants. T o the contrary, EPA  affirmed the \nacceptability of risks from all HAPs, including HCl, as recently as 2020 and found, in fact, that \nrisks are much lower than it originally believed. 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020)  (\u201cWe are \nfinalizing our proposed determination that the risks are acceptable and that the current NESHAP [which excludes HCl controls] provides an ample margin of safety.\u201d)  (parenthetical added).  All \nthe data from the 2017 questionnaire on HCl was available to EPA when it performed the risk assessment that it used as the basis for its  2020 determination that risks are acceptable and that \nthe existing regulations provide an ample margin of safety.  \n \n8 See 69 Fed. Reg. at  398 (EPA states that \u201cunder the authority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined \nthat no further control is necessary because HCl is a \u2018\u2018health threshold pollutant\u201d).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 18  \nEPA  must  provide an explanation of its position, including the reversals and errors, on \nthe four HAPs (HCl, mercury, organics and D/F) at issue. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State \nFarm , 463 U.S. 29, 49 (1983)  (\u201cWe have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently \nexplain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner \u201d) (\u201c\u2026an agency changing its course \nby rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which \nmay be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.\u201d) Id.  at 42 . The failure of EPA \nto explain its reasoning for abandoning its previous legal and policy interpretations related to \nthese four HAPs is a clear violation of the Clean Air Act, which states that a  rulemaking \u201cshall \nbe accompanied by a statement of basis and purpose\u2026[which] shall include\u2026the major legal \ninterpretations and policy considerations underlying the proposed rule.\u201d  CAA \u00a7 307(d)(3), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a77607(d)(3).  \n \nIV. EPA SHOULD AUTHORIZE PLANT -WIDE EMISSIONS AVERAGING FOR \nALL HAPS COVERED BY THE RULE , INCLUDING O RGANIC HAPS  AND \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nIn its comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, NLA request ed that emissions \naveraging be incorporated into a final rule  for the newly regulated HAPs , to allow  lime plants to \nmore cost -effectively optimize controls to prevent excessive emissions across the entire fa cility.  \nNLA noted that in the 2004 Lime MACT, EPA permitted plant -wide averaging of PM emissions \n(with some limitations), explaining: \n \nWe believe that allowing averaging is appropriate here because of the identity of the units \n(kilns and coolers in all cases), and the emissions (same HAP in same type of emissions, since all emissions result from kilns and coolers). Averaged emissions unde r these \ncircumstances would, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source. The averaging \nprovisions are included in the final NESHAP as a result of the recommendations of the \nSmall Business Advocacy Panel convened as required by section 609(b) of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and improves the compliance flexibility options for \nsmall businesses, which is the intent of the RFA.  \n 69 Fed. R eg. 401 ( Jan. 5, 2004) .  \n \nIn the 20 24 Proposed Rule, EPA has proposed to allow emissions averaging for HCl and \nmercury emissions, with some restrictions. NLA commends EPA for including this approach but  \nbelieves that the same logic supporting emissions averaging for HCl and Hg supports emissions \naveraging for all covered HAPs . \n \nFor HCl and mercury, with limitations based on  pounds of H AP per ton or million ( MM)  \nton of lime produced, and for lime kilns seeking to comply with the same numerical standard, \nNLA agrees that EPA should authorize the weighted average methodology currently available \nfor PM in the current Lime MACT ( 40 C.F.R.\u00a7 63.7111) to show compliance. As explained \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 19 further below, NLA believes EPA should also authorize emissions averaging for organic HAPs \nand for dioxins and furans.9 \n \nA. EPA  Should Not Impose a Penalty on Emissions Averaging \nEPA  should delete the provision that  penalizes  emissions averaging by imposing a more \nstringent standard on averaged emissions.  This provision is arbitrary and unsupported by the \nfacts . As noted repeatedly, EPA has found that risks are already acceptable with an ample margin \nof safety for all HAPs with no additional standards at all. Accordingly, there are no benefits to \npublic health or the environment commensurate with any additional costs or controls that would be incurred to meet the emissions averaging  \u201cpenalty.\u201d EPA should delete this requirement and \ncall for averaged emissions to meet the same standard (on average) as un -averaged emissions. As \nEPA said with respect to PM as noted above, \u201c Averaged emissions under these circumstances \nwould, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source.\u201d Averaging should be encouraged, not \ndiscouraged, because it allows sources to use the most efficient methods available to meet the standards.  \n Simple mathematics prove s that incorporation of the proposed 10% penalty for those \nsources utilizing emissions averaging will be more restrictive than existing sources meeting the already proposed restrictive MACT floors for HCl and Hg at the unit level. Use of the emissions \naveraging alternative not only requires at least one kiln to operate below these new aggressive \nMACT floors, it then requires the unit to operate at an even more restrictive level for the averaging to be useful.  In other words, the inc orporation of a penalty for emissions averaging \nruns contrary to providing EPA\u2019s express purpose of providing additional compliance flexibility.\n10 \n EPA presumes that this option will provide reductions at lower cost on a unit -by-unit \nbasis.  Even if there will be some cost savings, this does not justify the imposition of a penalty for \naveraging. Operators may choose to average emissions for reasons that are not purely economic .  \nFor example, there can be operational or site constraint reasons that will prompt an operator to \nchoose averaging that are independent of cost.   \n As mentioned in these comments  and in prior submittals, there are still fundamental \ntechnical issues to be overcome for candidate controls to meet EPA\u2019s proposed aggressive standards before any arbitrary penalty is applied. As a result, EPA\u2019s proposal  for an averaging \npenalty  is essentially adding unsupported beyond- the-floor requirements . As has been pointed \nout repeatedly, the proposed limits already provide an ample margin of safety,  and no cost -\neffective beyond- the-floor controls are available. Thus, there is no environmental impact  being \nmitigated through an arbitrary penalty for those utilizing the emissions averaging option to demonstrate compliance . \n \n9 Accompanying these comments as Appendix A  is a \u201cblueline\u201d of the regulatory language that EPA included as a \nredline in the rulemaking docket. In this Appendix, NLA indicates suggested changes to the regulatory language \nreflect ing these comments.  EPA\u2019s changes remain in red, while the suggested NLA changes are in blue.  \n10 See 89 Fed. Reg. 28 9097.  \u201c We are proposing the emissions averaging compliance alternative for  \nexisting sources because we expect that it will result in a greater level of emissions reduction than the unit -by-unit \nMACT floor limits at a lower cost per pound of pollutant removed, while also providing compliance flexibility.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 20  \nTherefore, EPA should not incorporate any penalty on the emissions limits for those \nchoosing emissions averaging under this rulemaking. Furthermore, the Lime MACT already \nincludes emissions averaging for PM which has worked well for over 20 years, and no such penalty was applied.  \n \nB. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging for Organics and Dioxins and \nFurans  \nEPA should allow for emissions averaging for organics and for dioxins and furans. The \nstandards  for these two categories of HAPs  are extremely  low ( in the parts -per-million or parts -\nper-billion ), and whether such pollutants are detected in a stack test are often dependent on \nrandom chance-- whether such molecules happen to strike the probe during that test. Members \nhave reported to NLA that similar kilns of the same  size and  type, using the same limestone \nfeedstock and the same fuel, often have significantly  different oHAP or D/F test results  even for \nidentical kilns . Allowing averaging of these two categories of pollutants would help to alleviate \nthis issue and provide compliance flexibility to sources , and because EPA has found that lime \nindustry emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safely even in the absence of controls, \nno harm to human health and the environment would result from allowing such averaging.  \n While the limits for organics and D/F are concentration- based (as opposed to being based \non production rates as with HCl and mercury), there is no technical or legal obstacle to the \ndevelopment of appropriate emissions a veraging for these HAPs as well  (and they should be \ndeveloped without a penalty , as explained above ). \n \nA simple and appropriate approach for these HAPs would include  the following \nrequirements and methodology, and should be added to \u00a763.7112 (see NLA \u201cblueline, \u201d \nAppendix A ): \n \n\u2022 Step 1:  Complete performance tests and collect oHAP and D/F data in the units of the \nemissions limitations, respectively.  The measurement units are parts  per million, dry \nbasis and by volume (ppmdv) for oHAP and nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (ng/dscm) for D/F, both corrected to 7% O\n2 in the exhaust gas stream. \n\u2022 Step 2:  Based on the average flowrate for each kiln and lime cooler from the performance test, compute a flowrate weighted emissions average for comparison to the applicable limitation.  \n \nThe following is an illustration of how this would work in practice on a two - kiln emissions \naverage:  \n \n\u2022 Kiln 1  \no C\nK1 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.05 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK1 = Measured airflow = 25,000 dscm in this example  \n\u2022 Kiln 2   \no CK2 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.02 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK2 = Measured airflow = 50,000 dscm in this example  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 21 \u2022 Emissions Averaging Calculation:  \no Eavg = (C K1 x F K1)/(F K1 + F K2)+ (C K2 x F K2)/(F K1 + F K2) \no Eavg = (0.05 x 25,000)/(25,000+50,000)+ (0.02 x 50,000/(25,000+50,000)  \no Eavg = 0.03 ng/dscm which is less than the proposed limit of 0.037 ng/dscm  \n \nIn terms of necessary recordkeeping and reporting for the emissions average, like HCl \nand Hg, an annual average recordkeeping should be incorporated when this compliance \nalternative is utilized. In place of tons of lime produced, the rule should provide that lime operators can either: 1) record total kiln gas flowrate from each unit in the average during each calendar month; or 2) develop a dscm/ton of stone feed from the performance test used in the emissions average and lime produced each month to  demonst rate compliance with the emissions \naverages for these two pollutants.\n11 Suggested rule language is below:  \n \nThe emissions average for total organic HAP or D/F shall be computed as follows:  \n \n(a) The concentration of total organic HAP or  dioxins/furans shall be correct to 7 percent \noxygen using equation 5 of this section for lime kilns included in the emissions average.  \n(b) From the respective performance tests, obtain the flowrate in units of dscm for each kiln in the average.  \n(c) Using the following equation, Equation [X], compute the emissions average concentration for comparison to the emissions limitation:  \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 =\ufffd (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u2217\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36)/(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39)\n\u221e\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b=1  \n \n\u2022 Eavg = Emission average in units of D/F in ng/dscm, 7% O 2 or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% \nO2 \n\u2022 CKi = Measured concentration for D/F in ng/dscm or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% O 2 for a \nlime kiln  \n\u2022 FKi = Measured exhaust gas in units of dscm for a lime kiln \n\u2022 FKt = Total combined measured airflow in units of dscm for all lime kilns in the \nemissions average  \n \n \nC. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging Between New and Existing Kilns  \nFor particulate matter (PM), EPA allow s lime plants to average emissions between new \nand existing kilns, as explained below  in the Proposed Rule preamble : \n \nIf the lime manufacturing plant has both new and existing kilns and coolers, then   \nthe emission limit would be an average of the existing and new kiln PM emissions \nlimits, weighted by the annual actual production rates of the individual kilns, except that no new kiln may exceed the PM emission level of 0.10 lb/tsf. \n \n11 Given that lime kiln and cooler exhaust gas flows are proportional to decarbonization of limestone (and related \nfuel combustion to support calcination), lime production and exhaust gas flows are proportional by nature.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 22  \n89 Fed. Reg. 9090.  \n \nThe Proposed Rule does not permit averaging between new and existing kilns for HCl \nand mercury, even for kilns of the same type. EPA should allow such averaging for all HAPs , as \nit did for PM, so long as the new kiln does not exceed the new kiln standard. \n \nD. EPA  Should Not Require a Separate Emissions Averaging Plan  or Pre-\nApproval for Emission Averaging \nEPA\u2019s new proposal includes a requirement that sources using the option for emissions \naveraging to prepare and submit an emissions  averaging plan for approval before emissions \naveraging can begin. 12 This requirement is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. L ime \nproducers subject to this rule are already required to prepare an OM&M Plan and various \nperformance test protocol and notification documents as part of this regulation.  With this variety \nof administrative documents in place, EPA should simply allow li me producers to document the \nemissions averaging plan requirements in their OM&M Plan , without preparing a separate plan, \nand without submitting it for pre -approval. Inclusion of a pre -approval process injects a level of \ncomplexity and need for official action that is excessive, given the fact that emissions from the industry are already so low that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety without any new standards.  \n E. EPA Should Allow for Averaging Across HCl Subcategories, Including \nPlant -Wide Averaging \nAs previously discussed, a regulatory option that allow s emissions averaging provides \ncompliance flexibility for those sources  that opt to use averaging . However, this option can be \nfurther enhanced by allowing existing kilns, regardless of their subcategories, to be averaged \nacross a single plant. This would only apply to HCl, because EPA has only proposed \nsubcategories for HCl. It would also be unnecessary if EPA establishes a health -based emission \nlimit (HBEL) for HCl.  \n If EPA continues to set subcategories for HCl, NLA suggests that the final rule include a \nplant -wide, all kiln, averaging alternative. This regulatory approach can be accomplished by \nestablishing a site -wide limit as follows:  \n Establish a sitewide allowable HCl emissions limit by the following steps:  \n \n1. Determine the annual production capacity of lime by subcategory type for the \nfacility.  \n2. Multiply the sitewide total production capacity by lime type times the respective \nsubcategory emissions limit.  \n3. The resulting value will establish the sitewide allowable HCl limitation in units of tons per year.  \n \n \n12 \u00a763.7114(c)(2) , Docket ID: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0200.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 23 Compliance with the annual HCl limit would be demonstrated by:  \n \n1. Multiplying the lime production for each month by lime type times the respective \nHCl limit (or most recent HCl performance test value as available) to compute the tons of HCl emitted during the month. \n2. Add this result to the prior 11 calendar month period to compute a 12- month total \nHCl actual emissions level which is then compared to the site -wide allowable HCl \nlimit.  \n \nThis form of a limitation is comparable in form to an  HBEL though it is more restrictive because \nthe sitewide HCl limit would be based on the facility\u2019s Potential to Emit ( PTE) HCl using the \nHCl limits in the Proposed Rule.\n13 \n \nV. EPA CORRECTLY PROPOSED TO SET MONITORING REQIREMENTS AS \nFIVE -YEAR STACK TESTING  AND PARAMETRIC MONITORING  \n NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s proposal to establish 5- year stack testing and parametric \nmonitoring as the monitoring requirements for emissions standards under the Proposed Rule.\n14 \nThis is consistent with the existing requirements for PM for the lime industry , and, as EPA notes, \nthe parametric monitoring will ensure continuous compliance. Imposing more rigorous and costly monitoring requirements would not be justified in this case, given the low emissions of HAPs generally, and EPA\u2019s risk assessment showing that risks are acceptable with an ample \nmargin of safety even without additional controls. \n \nVI. NLA SUPPORTS EPA\u2019s  PROPOSED 3- YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD, BUT \nEPA  SHOULD EXERCISE ITS AUTHORI TY TO ALLOW  AN ADDIT IONAL \nYEAR THROUGH PERMITTING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF NEW CONTROLS   \n Given the extensive requirements for study, design, permitting and construction that lime \nplants would be subject to under the Proposed Rule, the need for a 3-year compliance period is fully justified to adequately test, engineer, design, and retrofit  lime plant systems,  and then \ndemonstrate compliance with the applicable standards . Any period less than 3 years would \njeopardize the industry\u2019s ability  to comply with the proposed standard. \n In addition, EPA should state  in the preamble to the final rule that it encourages s tate \npermitting authorities (or EPA if it is  the regulatory authority) to allow lime manufacturing \nplants an additional year to install new controls for this rule . The statute expressly allows  this \noption under these circumstances : \n The Administrator  (or a  State  \nwith a program approved under subchapter V) may issue a \npermit that grants an extension permitting an existing source  up to 1 additional year to \ncomply with standards under subsection (d) if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls.   \n \n13 This suggested rule language is not included in the NLA blueline, which rather reflects an HBEL for HCl.  \n14 NLA suggests some adjustments to the parametric monitoring requirements later in these comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 24 42 USC \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(B).  \n \nProviding an additional year through permitting will be necessary  given that the entire \nlime industry will be installing new controls simultaneously and will face difficulties with \nensuring that a limited number of vendors are able to install controls on dozens of lime kilns across the nation, particularly given recent supply chain shortages and issues. Also, given EPA\u2019s \ndetermination that emissions from lime kilns are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety, allowing an extra year for installatio n of controls will not harm public health or the \nenvironment. \n \nVII. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THE USE OF \u201cNEW\u201d AND \u201cEXISTING\u201d KILNS  \n EPA should also clarify its use of \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d kilns in the Proposed Rule. The \ncurrent NESHAP rule defines a new lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one for which \nconstruction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002. It also defines an existing lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one that does not meet the definition of a new kiln.  \n \nIn the 2024 Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n The EPA is including definitions of the terms \u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 as \nrelated to the requirements of this supplemental proposal and to clearly indicate that a \n\u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 in reference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal i s any \napplicable source constructed after January 5, 2023, and an \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 in \nreference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal is any applicable source \nconstructed before January 5, 2023. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9097. NLA has identified two problems with this. First, there is no language in the docket redline with definitions as described in the paragraph above. (This emphasizes the importance of including proposed rule language in the Federal Register  notice itself.) \nAppropriate language must be added to the final rule.   Second, NLA does not agree that the relevant date for what constitutes an existing kiln  or \na new kiln should be January 5, 2023. The current February 9, 2024, Proposed Rule sets  new \nstandards for the first time for all four HAPs and  was carried out in response to the Small \nBusiness review panel described above. If the date for determining if a kiln is \u201cnew\u201d is to be \nbased on the proposed rule date, the relevant date should be February 9, 2024.  \n \nAccordingly, EPA should revise the Proposed Rule  language to read as follows (changes \nmarked in red) : \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 25 \u00a763.7082  What parts of  my plant  does this  subpart cover?  \n(a) This subpart  applies  to each existing  or new lime kiln(s)  and their associated  \ncooler(s), and processed stone handling (PSH) operations system(s) located at an LMP \nthat is a major source.  \n(b) A new lime kiln is a lime kiln, and (if applicable)  its associated  lime cooler,  for \nwhich construction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002, if you met the \napplicability criteria in \u00a763.7081 at the time you began construction or reconstruction, except that with respect to emissions standards added [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE], \na new lime kiln is a lime kiln for which construction or reconstruction began after  \nFebruary 9, 2024.  \n \n \n NLA believes that this change will make it appropriately clear that when \u201cnew\u201d \nand \u201cexisting\u201d are used elsewhere in the rule language, they refer either to the PM standards or to the additional standards being added in this rule. (Thus, for example, a kil n could be \n\u201cnew\u201d for purposes of PM, but \u201cexisting\u201d for purposes of the additional HAPs.)  \n  In addition, the word \u201cinitially\u201d should be added before the phrase \u201cstart up ,\u201d and \nthe word \u201cinitial\u201d should be added before the  word \u201cstartup ,\u201d in section s 63.7083(a)(1 ) and \n(2), 63.7083(c) , 63.7083(e)(1) , 63.7110(f) , and 63.7130(b)  and (c) , to make clear that the \nrequirements in those sections apply to initial startup, not to each time a kiln is started up. This will avoid confusion with other provisions relating to recurring periods of startup and shutdown. \n \nVIII.  THE RULE LANGUAGE ON COMPLIANCE PERIOD SHOULD BE CORRECTED  While EPA\u2019s preamble clearly states that a 3 -year compliance period is intended for \nexisting sources, language in Section  63.7083( h)(1) in the redline rule language in the docket \nseems to indicate that the compliance period is only 180 days. The preamble states:  \n For all affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction on or before January 5, 2023, we are proposing to require compliance with the proposed standards within 3 years after the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later). For all affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after  \nJanuary 5, 2023, we are proposing that owners or operators comply with the provisions \nby the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later).  \n 8 Fed. Reg. 9098. NLA understands \u201c affected sources that commence construction on or before \nJanuary 5, 2023\u201d to mean \u201cexisting sources\u201d with respect to the new standards proposed in this rule, and that these sources are intended to have three years from the date of the final rule to \ncome into compliance.   \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 26  However, the redline proposed regulatory language in the docket is inconsistent with the \npreamble language and refers to 180 days rather than 3 years. There is also a discrepancy \nbetween the preamble and the redline rule language on whether the relevant \u201co n or before date\u201d \nis Jan. 5, 2023, or the date of the final rule. NLA believes that EPA should refer to February 9, \n2024, rather than the 2023 date, because, as noted above, EPA has made significant substantive changes to the rule . Indeed, it is possible that a source could have begun and completed \nreconstruction of a kiln between January of 2023 and February of 2024, without knowing what \nthe relevant requirements would be. (Section 112(a)(2) precludes use of the final rule date for \ndefining new vs. existing kilns.)   \n New section 67.7083( h)(1) in the EPA redline document reads:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before  \n[INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], \nthen the compliance date for the revised requirements promulgated on [INSERT DATE \nOF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 180 \nDAYS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATI ON IN THE FEDERAL \nREGISTER].  \n \nThis language should be revised to read:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before \nFebruary 9, 2024, then the compliance date for the revised requirements \npromulgated on [INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE \nFEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 3 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL \nRULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\n  \n \nNote: EP A\u2019s proposed revisions to \u00a77083 means tha t numerous references to \u00a77083(e) in the rule \nlanguage will need to be changed to \u00a77083(g). See the NLA blueline for these changes.  \n IX. THE RULE SHOULD ONLY APPLY PM STANDARDS TO COOLERS  \nAs currently written, the Proposed Rule would apply standards for HAPs other than PM \nto kilns and \u201cassociated coolers.\u201d For the reasons below, this should be changed, and the rule should apply only PM standards to coolers. Definitional language should also be added to make this clear.  \n In a lime plant, limestone is calcined in a heated kiln, and it is the emissions  exiting in \nexhaust from the kiln that contain the HAPs  address ed in this regulation \u2014HCl, mercury, organic \nHAPs, and dioxins/and furans. When the lime product is made, it leaves the kiln and is transferred to a cooler, a large vessel in which the lime product is cooled by the introduction of ambient air (not gases from the kiln). Pulling in ambient air to the cooler by means of a fan may result in the presence of dust or particulate matter in the cooler exhaust. Th is is why  EPA \nestablished PM standards applicable to coolers in the original lime rule.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 27  \nThis distinction is not important when the air from the cooler vents to the same stack as \ngases from the kiln, because those kilns will have to meet all the HAP standards at the stack. However, in some cases cooler exhaust  vents separately and is sent to a separate stack from kiln \ngases . In those cases, it is only necessary to test for PM at those stacks , because the other HAPs \nwill not be present.  \n Furthermore, as explained in the separate comments filed by NLA members Lhoist, \napplying the oH AP standards to separately vented coolers would result in anomalous results. As \nLhoist (which operates such a cooler) explains: \n In addition, the methodology used to convert a pollutant to a standard O\n2 concentration is \nmeant to be utilized in combustion sources.  Applying this same methodology to a source that utilizes ambient O\n2 results in nonsensical emission rates.  For example, consider a \nsituation from a lime cooler, where no oHAP\u2019s were measured.  Per the proposed rule, the source must report the total oHAP emission rate using the method detection limit.  The following equation demonstrates how a non- detect measurement for oHA P in a lime \ncooler becomes a significant emission rate when converting this to a measurement at 7% O\n2.  \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  @ 7% \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422=\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u2212\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 2\ufffd where,  \n \nEoHAP @ 7% O2 = Total oHAP concentration in ppmvd @ 7% O 2 \nCoHAP = Total oHAP concentration at the measured oxygen concentration \nO2 = Measured oxygen concentration at the source \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u221220.85\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd13.9\n0.05\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 278 =155 .7 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d @ 7%  \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422 \n \nA total oHAP measurement that started as a non -detectable emission rate at an O 2 \nconcentration of 20.85% results in a reported total emission rate of 155.7 ppmvd @ 7% O\n2.  At this emission rate, an operator would be required to install an add-on pollution \ncontrol device (likely an RTO) for an emission rate that is nonexistent.    \n Under the rule as written, this absurd result would occur even if no oHAPs were detected at the cooler at all, because the rule requires use of the MDL when no oHAPs are detected. (This is another reason EPA should use 0 for non- detects) . \n \nNLA suggests that this issue be addressed by modifying the definition of \u201c Lime Cooler \u201d \nin \u00a763.7143 as follows: \n \nLime cooler means the device external to the lime kiln (or part of the lime kiln itself) used to \nreduce the temperature of the lime produced by the kiln. For the purposes of this regulation, a cooler is associated with a lime kiln with respect to particulate matter (PM) emissions, but is not associated with a lime kiln for the purposes of standards for additional air pollutants added \nto the regulation on [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE].  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 28  \nIn addition, references to coolers should be removed from \u00a763.7112(o), and Table 1, \nLines 13, 14, 15, and 16. In Table 4, Line 1, the term PM should be restored to the parenthetical, \nbecause only PM emissions from separate coolers need to be summed with kiln emissions.  X. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THAT NOT ALL PERFORMANCE TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED IN THE SAME SCHEDULE  \n \n As written, \u00a763.7112 could be read to require that performance tests for all HAPs, \nincluding PM, be performed at the same time. EPA should clarify that this is not required. \nSources may have undertaken PM performance tests less than 5 years before the issuance of the final rule governing additional HAPs, and thus testing for PM could be on a different 5-year schedule than testing for the additional HAPs. In addition, sources may for practical reasons perform testing of the additional HAPs on varying schedules (although, of course, they would all have to be performed within the required period). NLA suggests adding the following language to \u00a763.7112(b) to clarify this point:  \nPerformance tests for the emission standards promulgated in this rule, including PM \nemission standards and emissions standards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at \nthe same time . \n XI. EPA SHOULD EXPRESS STANDARDS IN TERMS OF \u201cLIME PRODUCED,\u201d NOT \u201cSTONE PRODUCED.\u201d  \n \nIn the definitions section of the Proposed Rule redline (\u00a763.7143) , EPA includes the \nfollowing:  \nStone produced refers to the production of limestone from the lime kiln consisting of high calcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nSubsequently, the term \u201cstone produced\u201d is used in several places in the rule language, while in other places (such as Tables 1 and 9), the term \u201clime produced\u201d is used. EPA should consistently use the term \u201clime produced\u201d to refer to quicklime and dolomitic lime produced in lime kilns. Limestone is the stone feedstock used to make lime (which is why some other standards a re \nbased on \u201cstone feed.\u201d) The lime products are not limestone, or stone at all. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of  calcium carbon ate and/or calcium -magnesium \ncarbonate, while lime is calcium oxide  or calcium -magnesium oxide, a different compound and \nstructure entirely .  \n \nUsing the term \u201cstone\u201d for this material is likely to create confusion.  Using the term \n\u201clime\u201d to refer to lime products will be consistent with industry practice, and with terminology used by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n15 Accordingly, the definition of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be \ndeleted  from \u00a763.7143, and replaced with: \n \n \n15 See, e.g., https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024- lime.pdf . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 29 Lime produced  refers to the production of lime products produced from the lime kiln \nconsisting of high calcium quicklime, dolomitic quicklime, and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nThe term \u201cstone produced\u201d should be replaced with \u2018lime produced\u201d where the term \nappears elsewhere in the rule language.  The term appears in \u00a7\u00a7 63.7114 (c)(2)(i), 63.7121(g)(3) , \nand 63.7143. The term also appears in several locations in the Proposed Rule preamble, \nincluding in Tables 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and in text. These are inconsistent with the tables in the redline (which properly refer to \u201clime produced\u201d). All instances of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be changed to \u201clime produced\u201d if the reference is to lime product produced at the kiln. (Note further that \u201cquicklime\u201d is typically spelled as a single word with no spaces .) \n XII. EPA PROPERLY DECLINES TO PROPOSE BEYOND- THE -FLOOR \nSTANDARDS FOR EMISSIONS IN THE PROPOSED RULE  \n \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA correctly proposes not to set beyond- the-floor standards \nfor any of the covered HAPs.\n16  \n \nEPA is obligated  to consider  costs with respect to beyond- the-floor controls, as it is \ndirected to do in Clean Air Act section 112(d). A vital element in the analysis of the cost-\neffectiveness of an emissions standard  is whether it will significantly reduce the risk imposed by \nthe emissions to be controlled. In the case at hand, as recounted elsewhere in these comments, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment on all major sources in the lime industry in the 2020 RTR proceeding and determined that risks are acceptable at all major sources with an ample margin of safety  for all affected HAPs  even with no additional controls for at all . \nAccordingly, it cannot be cost -effective to impose additional costs on any existing source \nbecause the lack of a health or environmental benefit does not justify any new costs.  \n Imposing beyond -the-floor standards would impose unnecessary additional costs on \nsources. To  comply with any emissions standard, sources must calibrate pollution control devices \nto achieve the standard, with an appropriate margin of error to prevent violations. For example, when the treatment technology EPA identifies for mercury control is activated carbon injection (ACI), the rate of injection \u2014and thus the cost of carbon\u2014will directly relate to the emissions \nstandard. A lower standard means more carbon injected, and higher costs. Furthermore, existing \nplant configurations  may not be able to accept higher rates of ACI due to operational constraints , \nfurther increasing costs . Similar additional costs would be incurred for other HAPs as well if \nlower standard s were set. These additional costs cannot be justified by any consideration of costs \ncompared to risks because EPA already determined that the risks do not justify any additional controls at all.  \n In sum, NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s decision  not to set beyond- the-floor standards in \nthe Proposed Rule . \n \n \n16 In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed to set beyond -the-floor emission standards for mercury \nemissions from existing sources for most lime plants, and for both existing and new sources for sources making \ndead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 30 ISSUES RELATING TO SPECIFIC STANDARDS  \n \nHCL  \n XIII.  EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL BY MEANS OF  A HEALTH -BASED \nSTANDARD IN THIS RULEMAKING UNDER CLEAN AIR ACT SECTION \n112(D)(4)  \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA has reaffirmed  \nthat HCl is a threshold pollutant, and that a health -based standard under Clean Air Act Section \n112(d)(1) would be justified for the lime industry. While EPA does not propose to set such a \nstandard, it spells out the justification for such a standard, indicates what the standard would be, \nand requests comment on setting such a standar d. Thus , EPA can choose to set a health -based \nstandard in the final rule, and it should do so, for the reasons set out below.  \n \nA. EPA C arefully E valuated the S cientific D ata and C oncluded that HCl Was a \nThreshold P ollutant in the Original L ime MACT S tandard in 2004 and T hat \nFinding Was, and I s, Correct  \n \n The Clean Air Act allows EPA to use a health threshold when issuing emission standards \nunder s ection 112(d) for pollutants for which a health threshold has been established. CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(d)(4). Such a health- based standard must include an \u201cample margin \nof safety.\u201d Id. In its 112(d) MACT standard for lime manufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl \nwas a threshold pollutant, considering several factors such as \u201cevidence and classification of \ncarcinogenic risk and evidence of non -carcinogenic effects.\u201d 67 Fed. Reg. at 78054- 55.17 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for human receptors. Id.  at 78055. To aid in its ana lysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performing its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest \npotential for risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed  NLA\u2019s assessment.  \n \nIt is helpful to put these low risks in perspective. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) is the ratio \nof exposure (or modeled concentration) to the health reference value or threshold level ( i.e., \nreference concentration ( RfC) or acute exposure guidance level ( AEGL) ). HQ values less than \n\u201c1\u201d indicate that exposures are below the health reference value or threshold level and are likely \nto be without appreciable risk of adverse effect in the exposed population. 67 Fed. Reg. 78,055-\n \n17 In the preamble to the proposed lime  MACT standard  in 2002 , EPA noted that  it had included a detailed \ndiscussion of factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold \npollutant  in its proposed rule titled:  National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants From Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-\nAlone Semichemical Pulp Mills . 63 Fed. Reg. 18, 766 (April 15, 1998).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 31 56 (Dec. 20, 2002). Based on a n HCl risk assessment of all lime kilns in the industry, EPA felt \nconfident that exposures to HCl emissions from lime manufacturing facilities are unlikely to ever \nexceed an HQ of 0.2. Id.  at 78,056. In other words, risks from HCl emissions from lime plants \nhave a more than adequate \u201cam ple margin of safety\u201d because they are expected  to be \nsignificantly  lower than  the level at which there would likely be no appreciable risk  (i.e., an HQ \nof 1.0) .  \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed  a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sourc es of HAP . The maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (HI) for the lime \nmanufacturing source category was  estimated by EPA to be only 0.04 based on actual emission \nof HCl, nickel compounds, and acrolein emitted f rom lime kiln and cooler exhaust , and 0.05 \nbased on allowable emissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, ac rolein, and formaldehyde \nemissions as primary risk drivers , 85 Fed. Reg. 44,964 (July 24, 2020). In other words, when \nEPA did its follow -up residual risk assessment  using representative data under actual and \nallowable emissions scenarios , it found that the chronic risks from all noncancer HAP (including, \nbut not limited to HCl) were much  lower than the risks estimated in 2002, and even  further from \nan HQ of 1.0. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining that risks from \nuncontrolled emissions of HCl are acceptable wit h an ample margin of safety.  \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d Id.  at 78057.  \n Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HC l emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id.  EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities were below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since pa ssed. See CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1\n), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607 (b)(1).  \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in this rulemaking proceeding.\n18 \n In its recent RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor \nto conduct  a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard (which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone a health -based standard) w ere \u201cacceptable\u201d and \nthat the \u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960. EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \u201cmaximum individual cancer risk . . . for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 million,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing \n \n18 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to a health- based standard \nunder 112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified. If EPA had set \na health -based standard\u2014e ven a very high one that all sources would have met \u2014there could be no claim now that \nEPA failed to adequately address HCl. For EPA to now set a non- health -based standard without explanation would \nbe arbitrary and capricious and contrary to its own prior decisions.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 32 source category were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Proposed Amendments to Air Toxics \nStandards for Lime Manufacturing Plants , June, 2020.19 As such, because EPA concluded that \nthere are no health or safety risks under the current lime NESHAP, if EPA issues any standard at all, it should issue a health -based standard for HCl, as it would more than adequately protect the \npublic and is based on the best available science.  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November 18, 2021, EPA \nissued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations industry. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication \nOperations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and \nFabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. 18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA specifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d 86 Fed. Reg. 64391-92.  \n \nSeveral other RTRs have confirmed that EPA\u2019s longstanding position is that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing and \nAsphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, 14535 \n(Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity  to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk assessment \u2026 indicate \nthere is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is not classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d). \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, for EPA to reverse its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry would be arbitrary and capricious. As explained below, the recent Sierra Club decision in the brick/clay MACT rule does not provide any such new information or law. As noted above, newer information (including the Ramboll report), only serves to strengthen the determination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA may not reverse its prior decision on this topic and should promulgate a health-based standard for HCl. \n B. EPA is N ot Constrained by the B rick/ Clay Sierra Club  MACT C ase because \nLime M anufacturing I s Clearly D istinguishable from T hat C ase in A ll Its \nKey Factual/T echnical/ Legal C onclusions  \n In 2018, the Sierra Club and others challenged EPA\u2019s use of a health- based standard for \nHCl in the MACT standard for the brick/clay industry. Sierra Club v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. \n2018). Although the court sided with the Sierra Club in the case, the court did not say that EPA cannot issue a health -based  standard for HCl. Rather t he court remanded  EPA\u2019s standard for \nfurther consideration based on the three reasons discussed below. Critically, given current knowledge on HCl and the facts in the lime industry, none of these reasons is either relevant today, or can be used to deny use of a health-based standard for HCl for the lime manufacturing RTR.   \n \n19 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 33 First, the court held that EPA had not met the s ection 112(d)(4) requirement that a health \nthreshold be \u201cestablished.\u201d Id. at 10 -11. EPA had reviewed toxicity assessments in several \ndatabases and opinions from scientific bodies and found that none classified HCl as carcinogenic \nor \u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic.\u201d Id. However, the court held that EPA had not provided a sufficient record to determine that there was no cancer risk. EPA, the court stated, noted that \u201clittle research\u201d had been conducted on carcinogenicity of HCl. Ultimately, the court \ncharacterized EPA as relying on the \u201clack of any significant studies.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \nTherefore, the court held that EPA acted unreasonably by concluding that it is \u201cestablished\u201d that \nHCl poses no cancer risk. Id.  \n The overwhelming scientific consensus regarding the non- carcinogenicity of HCl is \nwidely accepted and compels the conclusion that HCl does not cause cancer. To aid in \npromulgation of the revised RTR, NLA engaged toxicology experts from the firm Ramboll to \nprepare a report on the carcinogenicity of HCl, which NLA provided to EPA on June 29, 2021 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0073) . In contrast to the insufficient record that served as the basis \nfor the Sierra Club court\u2019s holding, Ramboll concluded that \u201cHCl has not  been identified as a \ncarcinogen, either by authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own search of the scientific literature, \ndespite its long history of use.\u201d Ramboll, \u201c Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Hydrochloric \nAcid (HCl) and HCl Mist ,\u201d (June 11, 2021) (\u201cRamboll Report\u201d). Ramboll stated:  \n \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and \nepidemiological studies in exposed workers. Several authoritative groups \n(including the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer [IARC], the Internation al Programme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the international Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development [OECD]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of these groups have concluded that \nHCl is a carcinogen. Oth er authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology \nProgram) have chosen not to evaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is unlikely based on its physical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association with cancer.  \n  \u2026 \nIn addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramboll did a \nseries of additional literature searches for any new studies which might \nindicate HCl is a carcinogen. We employed several search strategies to \nmake sure we uncovered any new scienti fic evidence that may not have \nbeen considered by previous assessments. Despite this broad search, we \nidentified only six additional publications. This newer evidence is \nconsistent with the earlier body of scientific evidence. In addition to direct \nstudies  of cancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence \nin the form of genotoxicity studies or potential to induce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 34 Ramboll Report, Executive Summary. These conclusions satisfy the requirements of the Sierra \nClub decision, and thus, for purposes of the lime manufacturing RTR revisions, HCl should be \nconsidered a health threshold pollutant.  \n  In response to the new Proposed Rule, a t NLA\u2019s request Ramboll has performed a further \nliterature review for any new studies relating to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl. (See \nSecond Ramboll Report, Appendix B  to these comments). Ramboll identified three additional \nrelevant studies, but analysis of those studies did not change Ramboll\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \nnot a human carcinogen. (See below for further discussion of the Second Ramboll Report)  \n \nThe second basis for the Sierra Club court\u2019s rejection of EPA\u2019s characterization of HCl \nas a threshold pollutant was the court\u2019s conclusion that EPA used only a single -low confidence, \nlow-quality risk assessment in its review, and that EPA did not use a more stringent California \nEPA (\u201cCalEPA \u201d) reference concentration for HCl that does not pose a health risk. 895 F.3d at \n12. This concern does not apply to the lime RTR. The lime RTR risk assessment performed by EPA included multiple, robust dose -response asse ssments, including CalEPA chronic and acute \ninhalation reference exposure levels (\u201cRELS\u201d) \n20 21 Even using the more conservative CalEPA \nRELs for HCl, t he EPA risk assessment found no unacceptable human health risk due to chronic \nor acute inhalation exposure.  \n Use of the CalEPA REL in the RTR risk assessment, combined with the Ramboll study, \ndemonstrate s that in utilizing a health -based threshold for HC l in the revised lime RTR, EPA \nwould not be relying on a \u201csingle low -confidence, low -quality\u201d risk assessment. Rather, EPA \nwill be relying on a risk assessment that includes multiple robust dose -response assessments.  \n Finally, the Sierra Club court concluded that EPA\u2019s brick/clay health- based assessment \nwas flawed because the court could not determine whether EPA provided any \u201cample margin of safety\u201d in the HCl health threshold as required by section 112(d)(4). Id.  at 13. This flaw in EPA\u2019s \nreasoning in the brick/clay context should be readily  addressed in this rulemaking  \u2013 EPA should \nbreak out specifically and set forth in precise terms its \u201cample margin of safety\u201d conclusions  \n(which it already made in the context of the risk assessment performed for the RTR) . \n \nC. EPA\u2019s New Proposed Rule Properly  Concludes that HCl is a Threshold \nPollutant  \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA seeks comment on potentially setting a health- based \nstandard for HCl. EPA makes several key statements that support moving to such a standard. \nFirst, EPA recognizes that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for a health-\nbased standard  (or as denoted  by EPA, a health- based emission limit or HBEL)  to be set. EPA \nstates in the preamble:  \n \n \n20 Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the Risk and Technology \nReview 2019 Proposed Rule , EPA 2019, May, p. 27.  \n21 CalEPA defines the REL as \u201cthe concentration level at or below which no health effects are anticipated in the \ngeneral human population.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 35 With regard to  carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that the science and \nmethods of cancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA \namendments were issued. The EPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold or threshold po llutants.  Linear non- threshold carcinogens can cause adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, at any level of exposure. In contrast, non- linear threshold \ncarcinogens may pose a cancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA section 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus \non a threshold, not cancer risk, we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9092 (footnotes omitted). This is an important point, although as set out above, \nEPA should properly find that HCl is not a carcinogen. \n \n EPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic, and that evidence \nshows that there is a health threshold for hyperplasia, which could theoretically lead to cancer. 89 Fed. Reg. 9092- 9093. EPA goes on to appropriately distinguish it s current findings from \nconcerns raised by the Court in Sierra Club.  \n \n Based on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health -based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows:  \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of 300 tpy, not to exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would expect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions \nfrom this source category, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain at \nlevels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a maximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety and whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9094.  \n  NLA strongly believes that such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety. \nNote that EPA has already performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and has (on multiple occasions) found that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin  of safety with no additional standards at all. Thus, the suggested HBEL will \nalso provide an ample margin of safety\u2014because one already exists.  The HBEL would guarantee \nthat HCl emissions would remain below any possible le vel of concern.  NLA does not believe \nthat other measures beyond those elsewhere in the Proposed Rule would be necessary to support \nthe standard. (See discussion below of rule language changes that would be needed to implement \nthe HBEL.)  \n  In its Second Report (Appendix B ), Ramboll reviewed EPA\u2019s methodology and \nconclusions, and confirmed that EPA was correct in its evaluation of the potential risks of HCl, \nincluding EPA\u2019s findings on carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and other health effects. One point \nemphasized by Ramboll is that if HCl were a human carcinogen, it would be expected that evidence of its carcinogenicity would have emerged, given the extensive u se of the material in \nworkplace settings. Rather, as Ramboll states:  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 36  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have \nbeen studied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that many individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actuall y exposed \nto mixtures that included recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  \n \nSecond Ramboll Report, Executive Summary ( Appendix B ). Furthermore, Ramboll reviewed \nEPA\u2019s air modelling approach, and confirmed that it  was appropriate ( and conservative). \nRamboll states:  \n \nThe air modeling performed by EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to \nan acceptable margin of safety. The default assumptions of the air model are expected to \nproduce conservative air concentrations, and the definition of the receptor locations \nshould produce reasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors. In addition, the \nchronic and acute toxicity reference values used for the risk assessment are based on the \nbest available science.  \n \nId. Ramboll concludes:  \n \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll \ntherefore recommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard \nfor HCl be based on a health- based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n Id.  \n \nNLA requested that a second consultant, Trinity, also review EPA\u2019s air dispersion \nmodeling. Trinity also concluded that EPA\u2019s approach was correct. Trinity\u2019s report (accompanying these comments as Appendix C ), states:  \n \nWe did not find any material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the \nanalysis is consistent with prior methods for analyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has proposed an HBEL for HCl providing \nconservative estimates of concentrations in ambient air, the analysis relies on input data \nfrom the industry for the \u201cworst case\u201d sources and applied the air dispersion in a manner \nconsis tent with accepted practice. Therefore, we believe the predicted modeling impacts \nsupport EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime Manufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in the source category.\u201d  \n NLA strongly urges EPA to set a health -based standard for HCl, based on its own \nfindings and the confirmation provided by Ramboll  and Trinity. \n  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 37 D. Strong P olicy R easons Support  Concluding that HCl I s a T hreshold \nPollutant and P romulgating a Section 112(d)(4) S tandard  \n \nIn addition to the legal and technical arguments above, there are several strong policy \nreasons that should compel EPA to issue a s ection 112(d)(4) health- based standard for HCl in \nthis rulemaking. First, institutionally, EPA should always seek to preserve its regulatory \nauthority/flexibility in this context. And, given the powerful data in support of a health- based \nthreshold here, if  EPA concludes to the contrary, it is hard to see how EPA could ever \ndemonstrate a health threshold under s ection 112(d)(4). The Sierra Club court held that EPA is \nnot \u201cobligated to conclusively resolve every scientific uncertainty before it issues regulation.\u201d 895 F.3d at 10 (citations omitted). Specifically, relating to s ection 112(d)(4), the court held:  \n \nThe statutory term \u201cestablished\u201d does not unambiguously require that the \nEPA prove its scientific conclusions beyond all possible doubt. Nor does \nthe term \u201chealth threshold\u201d require that the EPA find a specific threshold \nthat lacks uncertainty. With respec t to scientific conclusions, \u201cestablished\u201d \nand \u201chealth threshold\u201d are ambiguous terms and we give deference to the \nEPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness.  \n \nId.  \n \nUnder this standard, it would clearly  be reasonable for EPA to conclude that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant in the context of this rulemaking. Indeed, a conclusion to the contrary would be a harmful precedent, given the evidence here, and it could be read to deprive EPA of the flexibility to use health -based standards as provided under the statute. Regulating HCl using a \nhealth -based standard f or lime is not only faithful to the intent of Congress in enacting s ection \n112(d)(4) and to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s concer ns as expressed in the Sierra Club decision , but is also \na reasonable and appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s discretion in setting standards for pollution \nprevention that protect the public with an ample margin of safety.  \n \nSecond, EPA should make it clear that even if it believes that it must set standards \npursuant to s ections 112(d)(2) and (3) for additional  HAPs, the provisions in the statute \nproviding for alternative approaches to the methods described in 112(d)(2) and (3) remain available to EPA . These include the provisions allowing a health -based standard under 112(d)(4), \nas well as the provisions providing for subcategories under 112(d)(1) and work practices under 112(h). In the case at hand, there is already a  robust existing record in support of a s ection \n112(d)(4) standard, and thus applying such a standard will not prolong the time needed to draft and promulgate a standard. \n \nFinally, use of a health -based standard would greatly simplify compliance (because there \nwould be a single standard rather than multiple subcategories), and it would also simplify  the \nissue of emissions averaging for HCl, because the health -based standard EPA suggests would be \na facility -wide standard, and not a standard for each individual kiln. EPA\u2019s own economic \nanalysis found that almost half of the capital costs of the rule (47%) are attributable to control of \nHCl. Promulgating a health- based standard would therefore significantly reduce the cost impact \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 38 of the rule on small businesses and on the lime industry, while  still protecting human health and \nthe environment.  \n \nUse of a health -based standard under s ection 112(d)(4) is particularly appropriate here. \nEPA used  two risk -based analyses and determined that there are no health risks from emissions \nof HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \u2014the first being EPA \u2019s evaluation of HCl health -based \nrisks in the original MACT rule, and the second being its section  112(f) risk analysis from the \n2020 lime RTR rule that there are no unacceptable risks from any pollutants regulated by the \nMACT standard.  \n E. How a Health -Based Standard Should Be Implemented \nIn the Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n Appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements would also be \nrequired to ensure compliance with the limit. The EPA is requesting comment on an \nappropriate structure for incorporating an HBEL in the rule text. Refer to the \nmemorandum, \u2018\u2018Revisions to 40 CFR part 63 Subpart AAAAA to Accommodate a \nHealth -Based Standard\u2019\u2019 , included in the docket for this rulemaking, for a description of \npotential revisions to the subpart to include initial compliance, continuous compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting rule language in support of an HBEL.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9094. EPA has informed NLA that the referenced docket item was not used  and \nthat the reference to it should have been deleted from the preamble, but that EPA seeks comment on potential revisions to the rule language. Below, NLA provides comment  on how a HBEL \nshould be implemented in the rule.  \n \nEPA states that, based on its analysis of risk, a  HBEL for HCl would be an emission limit \nof 300 tons per year, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). NLA agrees with EPA\u2019s \nevaluation that this standard would reflect acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety. (Indeed, as noted above, this standard is very conservative.)  \n \nThe HBEL standard would be applied on a source -wide basis  (as opposed to a kiln -by-\nkiln basis). This will necessitate some changes in rule language.  \n \nProposed \u00a763.7112(n) addresses computation of emission rates for HCl and mercury. \nBecause under the HBEL, emissions of HCl will not be calculated as a production -related  rate, \nthis section will need to be modified. Suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cBlueline,\u201d \nAppendix A.  \n \nNLA suggests  the following approach to demonstrate and document compliance with the \nHBEL for HCl , to be added to \u00a763.7112:  \n \nAn LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all lime kilns is below \n300 tpy and submit this with a Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS) before the compliance date.  The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test on each \nlime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of p ound s per ton of lime produced, \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 39 multiplied by the annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl \nfor all kilns at the site.  \n \nIf the LMP includes any kilns requiring add- on controls to comply with the HBEL, the \noperator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating parameter for \nother controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain compliance with \nthe HBEL. In this case, the LMP operator will submit documentation of the operating rate for DSI on units with controls, as applicable, and a compliance demonstration annually indicating actual emissions in the prior calendar year do not e xceed 300 tpy.  \n \nAlternatively, the facility may seek a practically enforceable permit provision from the LMP\u2019s local air permitting authority that limits HCl to no more than 300 tpy.  \n The LMP shall also certify in a  NOCS, by relying on the most recent HCl performance test \ndata for each kiln, that the sum of the hourly emissions rate (i.e., the sum of 3- run averages for \neach kiln at the site) is no greater than 685 lb/hr.  \n \n Sections of the rule relating to dry sorbent injection can be left in place to apply to those \nsources that may use DSI to  achieve the HBEL.  \n If EPA applies the HBEL, sections of the Proposed Rule  relating to emissions averaging \nwill not be necessary for HC l, because the standard is a sum of source -wide emissions and not an \naverage. These should be modified to remove references to HCl. These sections include \u00a763.7114 (b) and (c) , \u00a763.7121(g), and Table 9  (delete lines 1 through 6).  \n Table 1, lines 5 through 12, sh ould be replaced with \n \nFor\u2026  You must meet the following emission limit  \n5. All major sources  HCl emissions from all kilns must not exceed \n300 tons per year  (tpy) , and must not exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr)  \n Table 5, line 19, sh ould be replaced with:  \n           \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 40 For . . .

For a positive pressure FF or ESP, determine the number of sampling points per the stratification check procedures  of section  8.1.2 of \nMethod 7E using the sample \npoints determined using the \nprocedures of Section 8 of  \nEPA  Method  5D. \n \n Changes to other tables will not be necessary.  \n  NLA strongly urges EPA to adopt the suggested HBEL, for all the reasons stated above.  \n XIV. EPA ACTED REASONABLY IN PROPOSING  SUBCATEGORIES FOR HCL  \n As noted above, EPA should abide by its longstanding finding in 2004 that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant (and not a carcinogen) and should establish a health- based standard for HCl \npursuant to Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) in lieu of a MACT floor standard.  \n If, however, EPA continues to pursue non- health -based emissions standards for HCl, \nNLA supports the proposal to establish subcategories . NLA supports the six subcategories EPA \nhas proposed. EPA has made several technical corrections to the subcategory analyses and MACT floors  in the new Proposed Rule, which NLA supports .\n23 \n \nA. EPA H as Flexibility to Set Standards for S ubcategories  \n Clean Air Act s ection 112(d)(1) provides : \u201cThe Administrator may distinguish among \nclasses, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory in establishing such standards except that, there shall be no delay in the compliance date for any standard applicable to any source under subs ection (i) as the result of the authority provided by this sentence.\u201d  Under \nsection 112(d)(3) , the standard can be no less stringent than:  \n \n(A) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or \nwithin 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a \n \n22 See discussion below on the addition of Method 26.26A.  \n23 NLA\u2019s \u201cblueline\u201d of suggested rule language changes in Appendix B reflects inclusion of a health- based standard \nfor HCl. If EPA declines to set a health -based standard, several changes to the language would be required, as set \nout in this section, and in the section on emissions averaging above.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 41 level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the \nsource is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as \ndefined by section 7501 of this title) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory for categories and subcategories with 30 or more \nsources, or  \n(B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category \nor subcategory for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources.  \n \nAccordingly, if a subcategory has fewer than 30 sources, the standard is based on the average \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources.  \n \nEPA\u2019s decision to set subcategories  has been repeatedly upheld by the courts. In Sierra \nClub v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018), the court upheld EPA\u2019s  decision to establish \nsubcategories for brick kilns by size. In setting a brick MACT floor, EPA set separate standards for PM (used as a surrogate for non -mercury hazardous metals) and mercury, with subcategories \nfor large tunnel and small tunnel brick ki lns. NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products \nManufacturing; and NESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufacturing, 80 Fed. Reg. 65470, 65471 \n(Oct. 26, 2015) .  \n In U.S. Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 2016), the court upheld EPA\u2019s \nestablishment of subcategories for major boilers (based on primary fuel combusted and method \nused to feed the boiler), and for area boilers (based on size) . The court held that EPA \u2019s creation \nof subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers burned was based on a reasonable interpretation of CAA provisions  permitting EPA to distinguish among \u201cclasses, types, and \nsizes\u201d of sources when establishing hazardous air  pollutant emissions standards, and was not \narbitrary and capricious, even though a single boiler could use different fuels over the course of \nits lifetime . EPA explained that boilers varied in their designs depending on the  type of fuel they \nburned, which affected boiler emissions and the feasibility of emissions controls. Id. a t 656. EPA \ndemonstrated with sufficient evidence that burning a different fuel made a boiler a different type of boiler, and thus EPA \u2019s creation of subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers \nburned was not arbitrary or capricious . Id. a t 657.  \n  In the Proposed Rule , EPA base s its HCl subcategories on two factors that affect HCl \nemissions, as shown by data analyzed by EPA \u2014kiln type (preheater rotary, straight rotary, and \nvertical), and lime product produced (high calcium lime and dolomitic lime). EPA reasonably determined that these differences in equipment and in product resulted in differences in \nemissions that justify establishment of subcategories. NLA fully supports this determination, as \nexplained in more detail below . \n \nThe proposed HCl subcategories for the lime manufacturing industry are based on kiln \ntype (i.e., straight rotary, preheater rotary, and vertical ), and lime product (high calcium \nquicklime or dolomitic lime) . The six subcategories proposed by EPA are : \n \na. Straight rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nb. Straight rotary kilns making high calcium  quicklime   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 42 c. Preheater rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead- burned dolomitic lime  \nd. Preheater rotary kilns making high calcium quicklime  \ne. Vertical kilns making dolomitic quicklime and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nf. Vertical kilns making high calcium quicklime  \n \nNLA supports these subcategories , which are explored in more detail below. \n \nB. Subcategorization by Kiln Type  Is Appropriate \n \nSubcategorization by kiln type include s the following:  \n \na. Straight Rotary  kilns  \nb. Preheater Rotary  kilns  \nc. Vertical kilns  \n \nHCl emissions from rotary kilns equipped with a preheater are typically lower than a \nstraight rotary kiln with no preheater. This is because , among other things, HCl that exits the kiln \ncan be chemically adsorbed by lime (CaO) and limestone (CaCO 3) in the preheater  section of the \nkiln. This has the overall effect of lowering HCl stack emissions. In addition, the stack \ntemperature of a preheater kiln is lower than a straight rotary kiln , which lowers HCl formation.  \n \nConversely, a straight rotary kiln with no preheater and similar inputs has HCl emissions \nhigher than a preheater equivalent. Both kiln types will have some adsorption of HCl in the rotary kiln, but a straight rotary kiln does not have the additional oppor tunity for HCl adsorption \nin the preheater.  \n \nVertical lime kilns also have a different emissions profile from straight kilns. In vertical \nkilns, close contact between the gases in the kiln and the stone and lime tends to scrub out HCl emissions.  \n C. Subcategorization by Lime Product Produced  Is Appropriate  \n \nIn addition to kiln type, lime sources should be further subcategorized by product type , as \nEPA proposed:  \n \na. High calcium quicklime  \nb. Dolomitic lime  (and dead- burned dolomitic lime)  \n \nThe data in the record show that kilns producing dolomitic lime consistently have \nsignificantly higher HCl emissions than kilns producing high calcium lime (this is true even \nwhen the two kinds of product are produced in the same kiln). These differences are due to \ndifferences i n the stone feedstock, and not because of fuels or equipment. Dolomitic lime is \nmade from naturally occurring stone with a higher percentage of magnesium chloride than high calcium quickl ime. Also, it should be noted that dolomitic l ime and high calcium quick lime are \ndifferent products and have different uses and markets. Accordingly, the differences in HCl \nemissions between these two types of lime are appropriate for subcategorization.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 43  \nD. Subcategory for Vertical Kilns Making Dolomitic Lime  \n \nData submitted to EPA pursuant to the previous Information Collection Request (ICR) \ndid not include data on vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime, so in the January 2023 Proposed Rule, E PA grouped all vertical kilns into  a single category. NLA \u2019s prior comments noted, \nhowever, that in  categorizing HCl emissions, vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime should be \ngrouped with preheater kilns producing dolomitic lime, because in this case, similarities related to product type are more significant than similar ities in kiln equipment.\n In the 2004 Proposed \nRule, EPA places vertical kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime into their \nown subcategory, but with the same applicable HCl standard as  preheater kilns making these products. NLA supports this change.  \n  \nXV. HCL \u2014TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nA. The MACT F loor C alculations for HCl Have Been Properly Corrected for \nthe Straight Rotary High Calcium Quicklime ( SR, QL) and Preheater \nRotary, High Calcium Quicklime  (PR, QL), Except that the Limit for \nStraight Rotary Kilns Making Quicklime Has Been Incorrectly Calculated  \n \nIn EPA\u2019s prior MACT floor analysis, five kiln s were miscategorized as preheater rotary \nkilns, when in fact  they are straight rotary kiln s. EPA has properly corrected this error, which \naffects the MACT floor numbers for the SR , QL and PR , QL subcategories , except that the limit \nfor straight rotary kilns making quicklime has been incorrectly calculated (see discussion below) . \nThe necessary corrections were detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments, which are incorporated here \nby reference. ( EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0166.)  \n \n The MACT floor  limits  based on these corrections  that NLA suggested EPA should \npromulgate for the subcategories are summarized below:  \n \nTable A: Corrected  Hydrogen Chloride MACT Floor Limits for New and Existing Lime \nManufacturing Sources  \nKiln Type1 Lime Produced2 New Source MACT \nFloor Limit \n(lb/ton of lime produced)  Existing Source MACT \nFloor Limit \n(lb/ton of lime produced)  \nSR24 DL, DB  1.7 2.3 \nSR QL 0.015  2.5825 \nPR, VK  DL, DB  0.39 0.3926 \nPR QL 0.096  0.096  \nVK QL 0.021  0.021  \n \n24 Limits for the SR DL,  DB subcategory have been revised to be consistent with Table 1  of the proposed rule  \nredline . \n25 EPA has proposed a lower number for this subcategory. EPA\u2019s number is incorrect, as explained below, and 2.58 \nshould be used in the final rule.  \n26 EPA now proposes to set  a separate subcategory for vertical kilns making dolomitic and deadburned dolomitic \nlime, but setting  the same standard as preheater kilns making those products. NLA supports this change.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 44 Note:  \n1 - Straight Rotary (SR), preheater rotary (PR), vertical (VK)  \n2 - Dolomitic lime ( DL), high- calcium quicklime (QL), dead burned dolomite (DB)  \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Emission Limit  for HCl from Existing Straight Kilns Producing \nQuicklime  Must Be Corrected  \nEPA\u2019s proposed emission limit for existing straight kilns producing quicklime is \ncalculated using an upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation that incorrectly assumes that the \ndata set is statistically skewed. This approach does not follow EPA guidance or prior precedent.  In fact, EPA has arbitrarily deviated from prior UP L calculation precedent, applying a new \nprocedural precedent to set this UPL limitation.   \nFollowing the instructions in EPA\u2019s own UPL calculation tool used in prior iterations of \nthis rulemaking and in other similar UPL limit setting exercises, the data set should be considered \u201clognormal .\u201d However, with respect to  this particular standard, EPA has arbitrarily \napplied a new statistical test, the Shapiro -Wilk test, which identified the data set as \u201cskewed\u201d. \nThe use of the Shapiro -Wilk test is not included in EPA guidance regarding the use of UPLs nor \nis NLA aware of any precedent for using this test in UPL MACT setting rulemakings. Further, \nEPA\u2019s memorandum Use of the Upper Prediction Limit for Calculating MACT Floors  included \nin this docket states: \u201cTo evaluate the distribution of  the data, EPA checks each dataset for \ndistribution characteristics by applying skewness and kurtosis tests.\u201d  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015- 0177)  Thus, EPA\u2019s established method already applies skewness and kurtosis tests, \nrendering it unnecessary and unreasonable in this  case to use the Shapiro -Wilk test.  \n \nIn this case, EPA apparently first evaluated the dataset in its traditional method using its \nUPL Calculation tool. As mentioned above, EPA\u2019s tool clearly concludes that the dataset is lognormal , resulting in a UPL limitation of 2. 58 lb/ ton lime produced. For reasons that are \nunclear , EPA abandoned the established approach and applied a new procedure, the Shapiro-\nWilk test, to conclude the dataset is \u201cskewed ,\u201d resulting in a much lower  UPL limitation of 0.52 \nlb/ton lime produced.  \n \nThe Shapiro- Wilk test is a statistically conservative methodology for determining \nwhether a data set is normal or lognormally distributed. This methodology only allows for a very narrow band of p- values to \u201cpass\u201d the normality test. The Shapiro- Wilk test is known to be \nconservative, especially for larger data sets as all data must be in a  narrow range. In other words, \nthis Shapiro- Wilk test significantly increases  the likelihood of a finding that  a dataset is \n\u201cskewed\u201d and not \u201clognormal .\u201d \n Although this methodology is not supported by precedent in EPA\u2019s extensive  history of \nsetting MACT limits, NLA has reviewed this data set using this test. As shown in graph below, the data set using this new test is not normally distributed because a small subset of values lie \nslightly outside of the p- value allowable range.  Th e outcome is that EPA\u2019s proposed limitation \nis substantially and unreasonably lowered.  \n \n \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 45 Figure 1 \u2013 Illustration of the Shapiro - Wilk Test Results and Corresponding P -values  \n \n \n  \nIn the figure , the limited data points outside the blue shaded areas force the conservative \nconclusion from the Shapiro- Wilk test that the dataset is \u201cskewed\u201d contrary to EPA\u2019s \nconventional normality tests for setting UPLs. \n \nIn addition to the arbitrary application of the Shapiro -Wilk test, and EPA\u2019s failure to \nfollow its own established procedures, the calculated emission limit fails to  develop an emission \nlimit that is achievable even by the MACT Floor sources. EPA utilizes the UPL methodology to \ncalculate an emission limit that MACT Floor sources are capable of meeting within 99% certainty. In this case, n ot only is the proposed limit equal to the average result of one of the \nMACT Floor sources, two of the three runs for tha t kiln are equal to or greater than the proposed \nlimit. Establishing an emission limit with which even the MACT Floor sources cannot continuously comply does not meet Clean Air Act MACT limit requirements. This outcome is \nunlawful and further demonstrates  that EPA\u2019s new use of the Shapiro- Wilk test does not properly \nset a MACT UPL limitation.  \n \nEPA should set the limitation based on its traditional method using its UPL Calculation \nTool and set  the limitation for this subcategory at 2.58 lb/ ton lime produced. \n \nC. EPA Should Authorize Use of Method 26/26A to Measure HCl   \nMethod 26/26A should be allowed by EPA to determine compliance with the proposed \nHCl emissions limits. Method 26/26A (used in testing HC l) was omitted from  Table 7 in the \npreamble to the January 2023 Proposed Rule  (88 F ed. Reg. 815) , and is also absent from Table 5, \nRow 19, in the redline in the docket . Method 26/26A is a standard isokinetic method that can be \nrun concurrently with PM sampling.  \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 46  \nIn Method 26/26A, gas is withdrawn from the source and collected directly in acidified \nimpingers. The impinger solution captures the HCl, and drives it to chloride ions, where it is analyzed by ion-chromatography. This is a simple approach that does not have the sample trans port difficulties found in the direct interface FTIR approach. It is one of EPA\u2019s promulgated \nmethods ( see https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-promulgated- test-methods\n; see a lso 40 CFR Part \n60, Appendix A-8), and it is allowed in other NESHAP rules ( see, e.g., 40 CFR section 63.7520 \nand Table 5  (boilers and process heaters)). Method 26/26A has several advantages over the more \ntechnically complex and expensive M.320/321. I t can allow for significantly lower detection \nlimits, does not require a trained FTIR specialist on site to operate the equipment, and is significantly quicker. The limited availability of trained FTIR specialists will be problematic for both the lime industry and the testing industry. Additional costs are significant and can easily be greater than $10K/plant using FTIR. M26/26A is a tried and tested accepted method for HCl analyses and is allowed for compliance demonstration in other industries, including in EPA\u2019s recent final taconite rule. \n  EPA should authorize the use of Method 26/26A as an approved method for HCl \ncompliance testing.  References to Method 26/26A should be added to \u00a763.7142, Table 4 line 1, \nand Table 5 line 19.  MERCURY  \n XVI. EPA SHOULD APPLY AN INTRA- QUARRY VARIABILITY FACTOR FOR \nMERCURY  \n On December 9, 2021, NLA\u2019s consultant Trinity Consultants submitted a memorandum \n(EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0074), explaining how EPA should set an intra -quarry va riability \nfactor (IQV) for mercury for lime plants, with supporting data. In the new Proposed Rule , EPA \nhas proposed an IQV, and NLA commends EPA for doing so. However, NLA believes that the IQV proposed by EPA should be adjusted to allow sources more flexibility in meeting mercury standards.  \nThe purpose of an IQV is to account for long-term variation in mercury content \nthroughout the quarry and has been incorporated into other standards with significantly sparser  \ndata than the lime  industry has provided. It is important to note that IQV stands for intra -quarry \nvariability, not inter- quarry variability. The point of the exercise is to understand how mercury \nconcentrations may vary in each quarry over time. \n NLA believes that in a case in which emissions of mercury are not controlled by add -on \npollution control devices, but rather depend on inputs from feedstocks, it would be arbitrary and capricious not to apply a reasonable IQV. Without an IQV, the MACT floor \u201cbest performer\u201d \u2014\nthe source that currently has the lowest mercury emissions\u2014could later find itself in violation of the standard if it is excavating limestone  with higher mercury levels from a different part of the \nquarry. The concept of the MACT floor p erformers is that these sources can meet the standard \nwithout additional controls\u2014something EPA cannot assert  for mercury in this rulemaking \nwithout applying an appropriate IQV.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 47  \nSufficient data is available to establish an IQV for the lime industry . As provided in \nAppendix I (1-13) to NLA\u2019s prior comments  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0166) , the lime \nindustry has 422 kiln feed samples as well as 61 samples from the Eden, Wisconsin quarry. This \nis substantially  more data than found in the docket for the Brick and Structural Clay Products \nNESHAP , for which  EPA promulgated an IQV standard. Nationwide, the Brick/Clay industry \nprovided 167 samples and the final IQV used in calculating the mercury standard for their \nindustry was based on seven samples from four plants.27 \n \nA. EPA Should Use Quarry Data from the MACT Floor Sources  \n \nAn intra -quarry variability (IQV) factor would account for variability in the mercury \ncontent of the raw material over the long- term life of the quarry. NLA\u2019s suggested approach to \nachieving  this objective is  well documented and supported by information supplied to EPA  \nduring its rulemaking process. The data showed that intr a-quarry variability of mercury in the \nreal world is relatively high , and would have a significant impact on the mercury MACT floor . \nThis is a strong justification for applying an IQV, n ot a reason for declining to do so.   \n \nThe Eden quarry samples are more representative of this long- term variability  than are \nkiln feed samples, because  they represent limestone that will be used in the kiln over the life of \nthe quarry. S amples that represent the life of the quarry are far more representative of IQV than \nmaterials stockpiled over hours, days or a week in transient short -term stockpiles.  In addition, the \nsamples from the Eden quarry were taken from drill holes throughout the quarry and at approximately 6- foot intervals. As such, each sample represents a section of the quarry that \nwould be mined over decades of quarry operation. As such, the originally proposed IQV based on data  for the two MACT floor plants , which includes quarry samples  from Eden  and kiln feed \nsamples from both plants, is appropriate for setting a UPL -based standard. In addition, EPA \nshould use this quarry  data because it represents the MACT floor source.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Use of Weighted Average Data in the Intra -Quarry Variability I s Not \nTechnically Sound, and EPA Should Use the Calculations Provided by NLA  \nNLA is pleased that EPA now proposes to apply an IQV based on data from the two \nMACT floor sources. However, EPA\u2019s calculation of the IQV must be corrected.  \n The methodology utilized by EPA in the proposed rulemaking does not properly reflect \nthe variability of mercury content in limestone  that should be reflected in an emissions limitation \nfor a lime kiln. As detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments on this rulemaking, an IQV is utilized to incorporate variability in limestone mercury content into the upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation used in developing an emission lim it.  \n In NLA\u2019s proposed methodology for applying an IQV to this rulemaking, limestone \nmercury content for the two kilns in the MACT floor were utilized to calculate an IQV. The proposed rulemaking also uses this data set, but EPA chose to use weighted average mercury content rather than individual test values. Limestone samples collected from each of the five \n \n27 EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0660, Appendix E  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 48 boreholes collected from a MACT pool quarry were weighted to reduce bias from varying \nsample interval thicknesses.  Weighted sample data enables meaningful comparison across the \nquarry and within each geological unit. In other words, sample weighting supports compar ison \nfor geological study purposes , but weighting is not appropriate for an IQV calculation where \ncapturing variability is necessary  and appropriate .28 \nA consequence of sample weighting is to lower the standard deviation of the data set , and \nlower the relative standard deviation, which significantly  reduces the IQV and corresponding \nemission rate, as much of the variability in the data set is averaged out. A data set of 70 data \npoints was reduced to only 7 with EPA\u2019s approach, thus mathematically suppressing the natural \nvariability that the IQV must account for.  \n An IQV is intended to adjust a UPL -based emission limit to reflect the expected stack \ntesting results for the MACT Floor sources for any reasonably expected mercury content. By \nusing weighted averages, EPA\u2019s calculations assume that all limestone in each core sample \nwould have the same mercury content or be burned during a single stack test. However, e ach of \nthese core samples represents a larger volume of stone across the deposit (in contrast  to the \nspecific grab sample data). Furthermore, using averages r eflects false assumption with respect to \nhow the quarry will be mined in practice , and how the mine\u2019s  stone will eventually be processed \nin a lime kiln , and when mercury would actually be emitted. That is, any single  (unaveraged) Hg \ndata point could represent stone fed to a kiln over any one day, month or year.  \n \nTherefore, EPA should not apply quarry data averaging and should rather base the \nexisting source Hg limitation on NLA\u2019s originally proposed mercury emission limit of 50.0 \npounds mercury per million tons of limit produced. This  remains the appropriate emission limit \nfor existing sources.  \n \nC. EPA\u2019s Proposal to Not Use the Best Performing Emission Source to Set the  \nMercury Limit for New Kilns I s Arbitrary and Unlawful  \nEPA evaluated two options for setting the mercury emission limit for new kilns, one \nusing the best performing source (at Graymont\u2019s Eden Plant) and one using the second- best \nperforming source (at Carmeuse\u2019s Maysville Plant) . EPA proposes to set the new kiln limit based \non the Maysville Plant . In each case, EPA included an IQV using the mercury limestone content \ndata for only that plant. As a result, EPA sets a lower standard for new kilns that it would have \nset based on the best performing plant, because of the difference in IQVs.  \n The Maysville Plant has only seven mercury content values on which to set an IQV , all \nbased on limestone feed data during two events. The Eden Plant data set is more extensive with \ncore data sampling throughout the quarry which better represents the mercury variability of the \nquarry over time. The  Maysville feed data is much more limited, and thus less able to show the \nvariability t hroughout the full quarry. A ny new kiln may be built at a limestone quarry with \nvarying mercury content similar to the Eden Pla nt quarry. It  is unreasonable to assume that any \nfuture kiln would have homogenous mercury content throughout its  limestone supply (and \nindeed, feed pile data may not accurately indicate mercury content in the quarry, because, as \n \n28 A more detailed explanation of this point is set out in NLA member Graymont\u2019s separate comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 49 EPA notes in the preamble, feed piles represent only a small portion of the quarry, and not a mix \nof multiple areas of the quarry ).  \n \nNotwithstanding the comments on calculating the IQV, setting an emission limit for new \nsources that is not based on the best -performing emission unit does not align with EPA policies \nand precedent. The Eden Plant kiln is the best -performing emission unit a nd based on available \nmercury data for the Eden quarry this unit itself cannot be reasonably assured to comply with the \nproposed emission limit  for new kilns .  \n \nEPA should set the new source emission limit based on the best -performing source rather \nthan arbitrarily using the second- best source.  \n \nORGANICS  \n \nXVII.  USE OF THC AS A SURROGATE FOR ORGANIC HAPS  IS UNLAWFUL   \n In its comments on the January 23, 2023, Proposed Rule  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0166) , NLA submitted extensive information demonstrating that Total Hydrocarbons (THC) \ncannot  be used as a surrogate for organic HAPs, because emissions of THC do not correlate with \nemissions of organic HAPs. Because EPA has appropriately decided not to use THC in this way, those points are not repeated here, but are incorporated herein by reference.  \n \nXVIII.  EPA \u2019S PROPOSAL TO SET AN AGGREGATED (TOTAL) ORGANIC HAP \nSTANDARD IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH , BUT CORRECTIONS ARE \nNEEDED  \n A. NLA Supports EPA \u2019s Proposal to S et a S tandard B ased on O rganic HAPs \nDetected and M easured at L ime P lants  \n In a December 6, 2021, memorandum  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0068) , NLA urged \nEPA to adopt an emission standard based on an aggregate of organic HAPs , similar to the \nalternative that was established for  the cement industry. NLA performed, with the help of a well -\nrespected  technical consultant  (Alliance  Tech nical Group (\u201cAlliance \u201d)), a comprehensive review \nof oHAP testing done during the rule development period. Rather than focusing only on the nine  \noHAPs that were previously submitted, the consultant thoroughly reviewed the Method 320 \nspectra fro m twelve stack tests conducted at major source lime kilns in order to identify all \ndetectable oHAPs in the tests. This review  resulted in the identification of six  additional oHAPs  \n(including the four identi fied by EPA) , providing a complete picture of oHAPs present using \napproved test methods , as shown on Table IV below . More details on this analysis are found in \nNLA\u2019s prior comments and its appendices , EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0166.  \n \nNLA, with the assistance of Alliance, generated a table including the complete list of \nidentified oHAPs that could be included in an aggregated oHAP alternative. This list includes (a) all oHAP s detected using EPA methods M.18 and M.320 and specific to lime kilns identified in \nstack test reports provided to EPA  in the 2016 s ection 114 ICR, and as part of a voluntary collect  \nion effort by the industry in 2021- 22, and (b) 6 additional oHAPs identified by new review of the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 50 test spectra, including all four of the additional oHAPs  identified by EPA in the January 2023 \nProposed Rule preamble (88 Fed.

NLA\u2019s prior comments urged EPA to \nselect this  aggregated limit as a reasonable threshold for organic HAP based on the specificity of \nthe HAP emitted from lime kilns combined with the low concentration and detection frequency.  \n This approach to an oHAP limitation is consistent with the C lean A ir Act and EPA\u2019s \nprecedents in establishing MACT emissions limitations . As noted above, THC is an \ninappropriate surrogate for organic HAPs in the lime industry . An aggregated (total) oHAP limit, \non the other hand, is a better option because it causes the allowable emission limit to be directly linked to the regulated pollutants and excludes irrelevant substances  that THC would include. \nThe use of an aggregated oHAP alternative was used in the Portland Cement  MACT , \nrecognizing inherent differences in emissions of oHAPs and THC from cement kilns. Lastly, the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 51 proposed aggregated oHAP limit follows established conventions that EPA is proposing for D/F \nin this rulemaking. The limit for D/F is based on the aggregate amount of D/F congeners and \ngiven their very low levels below detection limits, the use of three times the Representative Detection Limit (3xRDL) setting method is appropriate in such cases.\n29,30 \n \n Use of an aggregated oHAP limit is also appropriate here because of the very low oHAP \nemissions, the very low detection limits for many of the substances, the sporadic appearance of \nthese substances (note that no HAP listed above appeared in all tests, and many were not \ndetected in a majority of tests) ,31 and EPA\u2019s prior determination that risks from organic HAPs \nare acceptable with an ample margin of safety even with no additional controls at all.  Overall, the \nuse of a n aggregated  organic HAP limitation is superior to THC as a surrogate and should be \nincorporated into the final rulemaking. \n \nThus, EPA should use an aggregated oHAP approach as the emission standard for lime \nplants . Under this approach, sources would perform 5- year compliance testing for all the oHAPs \non the list, and compliance would be based on the total aggregate detected being lower than the aggregate standard. Continuous compliance would be ensured by parametric monitoring of air pollution control devices.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Proposed 8 -HAP Aggregate oHAP Standard Must Be Corrected  \nNLA is pleased that EPA has adopted the approach of setting an aggregate oHAP \nstandard  based on the sum of 3 times the representative detection limit (RDL) of a group of \noHAPs. EPA has proposed to base the standard on 8 organics (as opposed to the 15 set out by NLA), as follows:  \n        \n      \n \n29 See EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117. Memorandum from Steffan Johnson, USEPA Regarding \nDetermination of \u201cnon- detect\u201d from EPA Method 29 (multi -metals) and EPA Method 23 (dioxin/furan) test data \nwhen evaluating the setting of MACT floors versus establishing work practice standards.  \n30 See EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0112. Memorandum to Docket EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0058 \nfrom Peter Westlin, EPA/OAQPS/SPPD regarding Measurement Detection Capabilities for EPA for Instrumental \nTest Methods.  \n31 Another reason THC should not be used as a surrogate for oHAPs is that no single oHAP is \u201cinvariantly present \u201d \nin the proposed surrogate as required in Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d 976 984 (D.C. Cir. 2004) . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 52 Table C: EPA\u2019s Proposed  Aggregate Organic HAP Standard  \nPollutant  RDL (ppmvd @  \n7 percent O2)  3xRDL (ppmvd  \n@ 7 percent O2)  \nFormaldehyde  0.14 0.42 \nAcetaldehyde  0.29 0.87 \nToluene  0.014  0.02832 \nBenzene  0.022  0.066  \nXylenes (mixture of m,  \no, and p isomers)  0.023  0.069  \nStyrene  0.0043  0.013  \nEthyl benzene  0.057  0.18 \nNaphthal ene 0.0081  0.025  \n                                                  TOTAL  1.7 \n \nNLA requested that experts in FTIR and detection limits at Alliance review EPA\u2019s \nrevised approach and calculations, and this review revealed that certain elements of EPA\u2019s \napproach require  correction. (Alliance\u2019s report is Appendix D , and the accompanying Excel \nspreadsheets have been submitted separately as Appendix D2.)  \n EPA\u2019s proposed RDLs for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde differ substantially from the \nRDLs calculated and submitted by Alliance. While there are also differences with respect to the other HAPs on the list  between EPA\u2019s proposal and Alliance\u2019 s suggested values , they vary much \nless. These differences appear to stem from differences in how detection limits are set for HAPs measured using Method 320 (used for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) , and those measured \nusing Method 18 (used for the other oHAPs on EPA\u2019s  list). With Method 18, each analytical \nlaboratory typically uses a standard detection limit, based on testing of that lab\u2019s equipment and its capabilities. These tend to be similar to each other  across the analytical service industry , and \nthus there is not likely to be a large range of values. With Method 320, on the other hand, a detection limit is calculated with respect to each test that is performed, and it can vary substantially, particularly if proper procedures are not followed in determining the detection limit.  \n In developing its proposed RDLs for the 8 HAPs, EPA averaged the five lowest detection \nlimits used in tests for each HAP. This averaging approach did not produce anomalous results for \nHAPs tested using Method 18 because, as noted above , labs use a single value for all tests, and \nthey tend to be similar. However, as detection limits for Method 320 tests vary due to factors \nother than the lab\u2019s capability, arbitrary use of the five lowest values creates anomalous results, and does not generate a representativ e value. Instead of averaging only the five lowest detection \nlimits, EPA should (at least for the Method 320 tests), average all of the detection limits, to \ngenerate a more representative result. In setting the similar aggregated standard in the cement \nrule, EPA averaged the detection limits for all tests, and it should follow that precedent in this \nrule as well.  The purpose of averaging is to identify representative detection limits, not to \nidentify the arguably best performing labs.  \n \n \n32 Note: There is a calculation error in the proposed chart from the preamble. The 3xRDL value shown for toluene is \nonly 2 times the RDL, not 3 times as it should be. This should be corrected, and the correct number should be .042 \n(although the sum still rou nds to 1.7).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 53 Further review by Alliance of the same source testing reports used by EPA in its \nevaluation  revealed that some of the detection limits from stack tests should not have been used \nto calculate RDLs . Removing those results from the averaging yields a smaller number of tests to \nbe averaged, making the consideration of the issue of whether to average only the lowest results \nunnecessary.  \n \n  The discussion below explains why several  source testing  reports should be removed \nfrom EPA\u2019s analysis  and from the computed average. It also discusses several other corrections \nto the calculations that should be made. For the reasons discussed above, t his discussion \naddresses only the Method 320 HAPs (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde), because revision of the Method 18 results would not alter the final limit significantly.  \n1. EPA Should U se Method Detection Limits Determined O nly U sing t he \nMDC #2 Approach  \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data used \nby EPA . Both are from ASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA \nMethod 320, which is the standard method for FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from \nstationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL documentation, and are thus not \nincluded in further discussion, because it cannot be determined if proper methods were used to \ngenerate the MDLs used in those reports.  \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the \ndetector noise in a pure blank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound. This is \nuseful to determine the analytical uncertainty of a value, but it is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the \nnoise of the detector, but with the inclusion of major matrix interference. This is generally \nregarded as a more appropriate MDL determination since FTIR is an optical measur ement, and \nelevated absorbances from interference can significantly impact the analyzers ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration). Past EPA guidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for  data , and Allianc e confirms that MDC#2 is the preferred \napproach for this analysis . \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2 \n(see Tables 1 & 2). EPA\u2019s calculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four \nreports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the determination of the proposed measurement limit.  \nEPA should revise  the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard \ndirective of using MDC#2 calculated results to determine an appropriate calculation of a \nrepresentative detection limit. As the charts below show, when only MDC#2 results are used, \ndifferent (and higher) average values for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are produced.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 54 Table  D: Comparison of Detection Limits for M320 oHAPs Between MDC#1 and \nMDC#2 Procedures  \n \n  \n \n EPA should revise its RDL calculations to reflect these corrected values from Table 2 for \nthe two method 320 HAPs. \n2. MDLs Should be Summed on the Same Basis of Moisture and Oxygen  \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet basis (i.e., not corrected for moisture) , and \ndry corrected basis. This creates a certain amount of noise in the data set. Ultimately the detection limit values in the Proposed Rule  do not appear to contain a correction for moisture in \nthe source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other components. For example,  if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture \ncorrected basis from a source that contains 1 5% moisture , the result  becomes 1.176 ppmvd. \nWhere results from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same \nbasis, rather than a mix of wet and dry corrected results. As this total result may contain some \nmix of detected and non -detected compounds, the MDLs used for this standard setting should \ninclude this adjustment criteria.  \nSimilarly , as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, an  \naverage oxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the floor calculation. These corrections are included in the discussion of a bulk correction factor \nbelow. \n3. EPA Should U se a Bulk Average Correction Factor  \nIn the Proposed Rule , the value s of multiple chemical species are summed to determine \ncompliance with a limit that is based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen \nconcentration. V alues included in the summation must be corrected to this basis. To  set an \nemissions limit that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to \nmatch before  including them in the sum. From the reports reviewed by Alliance, the average \ncombined correction factor results in an increase of 22% to the re sults. However , Alliance notes  \nthat this is a source -specific correction factor depending on the moisture and oxygen content \nnative to the source. As such, attempting to normalize the limit based on adjusted results can \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 55 have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions. Given the variability, \nAlliance recommends  taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating \nthe standard . \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those \ncases the individual sources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table. Three reports \nwere excluded due to the variety of testing conditions that included abnormally high or low \noxygen and moisture concentrations . \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) \ndetermined by separately averaging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average \ncorrection factor for each. These average factors were then combined for a total correction factor. \nA second calculation determines the total correction factor for each source, then looks at an \naverage of these bulk correction factors. Both calculations are presented in Alliance\u2019s  Table \nreproduced below. Notably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the average of total factors from each report. \nTable  E: Summary of Moisture and Oxygen Correction Factors to Be Applied to \nDetection Limits  \n \n  Accordingly, EPA should apply a bulk correction factor of 1.217 to the RDL calculations \nfor formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  \n4. EPA Should U se Corrected M.320 Method Detection Limits  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the emissions limit determination, and accounting for \nthe corrections that must be applied to all formaldehyde and acetaldehyde data for summation, \nAlliance\u2019s  analysis shows a  standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 ppmvd @7% O\n2 \nformaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O 2 for acetaldehyde. Therefore, EPA should adopt these \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 56 RDLs  for use in the aggregated oHAP limit.  As shown in the table  below, correcting these values \nresults in an aggregated emission limit of 5.9 ppmvd @ 7% O 2, and EPA should adopt this value  \nas the limit in the final rule.  \nTable  F: Proposed Aggre gate oHAP Limi t with Corrections Applied  \n \nPollutant  RDL (ppmvd @  \n7 percent O2)  3xRDL (ppmvd  \n@ 7 percent O2)  \nFormaldehyde  0.88 2.64 \nAcetaldehyde  0.94 2.82 \nToluene  0.014  0.042 \nBenzene  0.022  0.066  \nXylenes (mixture of m,  \no, and p isomers)  0.023  0.069  \nStyrene  0.0043  0.013  \nEthyl benzene  0.057  0.18 \nNaphthalene  0.0081  0.025  \n                                                  TOTAL  5.9 \n \n5. EPA Should Allow the Use of Zero for Non -Detected oHAPs , and Should \nRevise the Definition of Total Organic HAPs  \n \nWithin the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d in \u00a763.7143 in the docket redline, EPA \nstates:  \n If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the  \nmethod defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the  \nmeasured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total organic HAP value.  \n This approach is unreasonable as applied to non- detect results. This approach would guarantee \nthat each measurement would result in a total of  at least one third of the standard, even if no \noHAPs were detected at all. Considering that the aggregate standard is already extremely low, EPA\u2019s treatment of non- detects will lead to  erroneous over -estimation and potential false non-\ncompliance results .  \n \nRather, for results below the detection limit, a value of 0 should be used for that HAP , \nsince the HAP was not in fact detected.  Note again , as shown above, that for the 8 oHAPs EPA \nproposes to use in the aggregate  standard , only two were found in more than half of the tests  \nreviewed, and none w as found in all tests. There is no reason to assume that an undetected oHAP \nis present in any test. Using 0 would also be consistent with the method EPA applies in the Proposed Rule  with dioxin/furan congeners that are below the detection limit.\n33 \n  In addition, the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d should not refer to \u201cmethod detec tion \nlevels,\u201d because this is likely to cause confusion. Rather, it should refer to the Representative \n \n33 While NLA believes that zero is the appropriate value to use for non- detects, EPA could, in the alternative, use \none half of the RDL, as it has done in other contexts.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 57 Detection Limits (RDLs) as specified in the table in the preamble.  If EPA declines to use zero for \nnon-detects, then it should include the table of RDLs in the final rule language and  should revise \nthe provision above to read \u201c ...you must use the method detection l evel or the representative \ndetection level (RDL) as listed in Table __, whichever is lower , as the measured emissions level \nfor that pollutant\u2026.\u201d  The lower of these two figures should be used, because the RDL is the \nsource of the standard, and undetected levels should not be presumed to be higher than the RDL.  \n \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nXIX. EPA LACKS SUFFICIENT DATA TO SET A MACT FLOOR FOR DIOXINS AND FURANS , AND SHOULD ISSUE A NEW ICR FOR DIOXIN/FURAN DATA  \n \nEPA proposes to set a MACT floor for dioxins and furans  (D/F)  for all major lime \nsources based on data from only two lime kilns \u2014one with non- detectable amounts of D/F, and \nanother with very low but detectable amounts. EPA rejected all other D/F data submitted by the industry based on determinations that the test methods used were not recognized by EPA , or for \nother technical reasons.  Based on these two data points, EPA proposes to set a MACT floor for \nthe entire industry\u201496 lime kilns \u2014assuming that MACT floor for the industry should be set \nbased on non- detectable amounts of D/F.  \n \nEPA provides no data indicating that the tests from these two lime kilns \u2014either \nindividually or taken together \u2014are representative of the emissions of the lime industry. It is \narbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a standard based on such limited data. Chem.  Mfg.  Ass\u2019n  v \nEPA, 28 F.3d 1259, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (\u201c\u2026we conclude that it was arbitrary and capricious \nfor the EPA to list MDI as a high- risk pollutant solely upon the basis of the RfC for MDI, \nwithout identifying any serious health effect with whic h it has ever been associated\u201d). EPA \nshould withdraw the proposed D/F standard and issue a new Information Collection Request to collect sufficient data to make a statistically valid determination of a proper MACT standard.  \n  Pursuing a new Information Collection Request for D/F would have multiple benefits. \nFirst, and most importantly, it would permit EPA to establish emission standards based on genuinely representative data from the industry. Second, if sufficient results are non -detect, it \nwould assist in  setting a work practice for D/F . Third, comprehensive data may show that \nsubcategories would be appropriate for lime plants emitting D/F, based on type of equipment or type of product being manufactured, as was the case for HCl . \n In the alternative, EPA\u2019s lack of adequate data should support the establishment of a \nwork practice for D/F , as described below . When EPA does not have sufficient HAP data to set a \nnumeric standard, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s promulgation of a non- numeric work \npractice standard. Chesapeake Climate Action Network v. EPA , 952 F.3d 310, 315 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n \nFinally, EPA should consider the alternative of setting no standard for D/F at all  as it did \nin 2004. EPA already established that D/F emissions from lime manufacturing processes are \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 58 negligible.34 Accordingly, such emissions are de minimis , and do not require an emissions \nstandard. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle , 636 F.2d 323, 400 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (describing EPA\u2019s \ndiscretion to exempt certain de minimis  releases from regulation under the Clean Air Act).  Such \na standard is clearly not \u201cnecessary\u201d under the terms of the LEAN  decision and the Clean Air \nAct. \n \nXX. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, EPA SHOULD SET T HE WORK PRACTICE \nSTANDARD FOR DIOXINS/FURANS  PROPOSED BY NLA  \n \nDuring the development of the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA repeatedly and \nconsistently informed NLA that it was planning to issue a work practice for dioxins and furans, \nbecause, according to EPA, it had D/F data showing that more than 55% of test results were non-detect, thus permitting EPA to establish a work practice. NLA and EPA had multiple discussions on the form a work practice would take, and NLA submitted a suggested work practice. See  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. NLA noted that due to the extremely low D/F \nemissions, an appropriate work practice would require sources to properly operate the air pollution control devices already in place to control particulate matter. However, in both the January 2023 Proposed Rule  and the new Proposed Rule , EPA proposed to set a MACT floor \nbased on data from a single lime kiln. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA requests  comment on a \npotential work practice. \n NLA continues to believe that EPA should apply the work practice previously submitted \nby NL A in EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. Considering that EPA has already \nfound that risks from dioxin and furan emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and that D/F emissions are extremely low, a practice requiring sources to properly maintain existing air pollution control devices is sufficient to ensure that risks from D/F emissions remain low.\n35 \n XXI. EPA SHOULD PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE METHOD FOR \nDIOXINS AND FURANS  \n \nNLA continues to believe that the work practice it previously suggested should be \nadopted by EPA. However, if EPA chooses not to provide a work practice, NLA suggests that EPA  set an alternative method of complying with the numerical standard by allowing an \nappropriate inlet temperature to the air pollution control device (APCD) to be set on a site -\n \n34 See EPA Docket No. A- 95-41, Item No.  II-B-121. (\u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners are well -\ndocumented but are shown to be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not \ncollected in this search.\u201d)  \n35 NLA has not included its suggested work practice language in the \u201cblueline,\u201d because EPA previously declined to \nadopt  this work practice. However, if EPA decides to include the work practice, the relevant rule language would \nstate that \u201c Lime kilns operators, as an indicator of good kiln operation, will comply with Lime MACT PMCD  \noperating requirements at all times. For lime kilns with a fabric filter (FF) or an electro -static precipitator (ESP) , \ncomply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements which serve to affirm good operating practices, and f or lime kilns with \na wet scrubber comply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements including continuous performance levels for flow and \npressure drop and flow rate which continuously assures good operation is occurring. \u201d \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 59 specific basis . This is due to the wide variety of gas temperatures entering the various APCD and \nthe variety of kiln/APCD configurations.36  \nThis approach is justified because compliance testing combined with a site -specific \ntemperature (i.e., inlet to APCD temperature) would ensure that each plant\u2019s configuration and \ntemperature parameters result in D/F emissions that meet the numeric standard. Compliance with the site -specific temperature should be on a 30-day rolling average. If annual compliance testing \nfor a period of three years shows the lime plant meets the numeric standard and the temperature requirement is met, then the lime plant shou ld be allowed to discontinue stack testing for D/F \nand show compliance through the parametric temperature requirement alone.  \nThis temperature -based approach would be a parametric way of implementing the 0.037 \nng/dscm standard. Therefore, the temperature-based approach is not a work practice, and measuring 0.037 with a stack test or measuring site -specific temperature would be alternative \nmeans of complying with the same numerical standard. (NLA would like to emphasize that this \napproach should only be set as an alternative means of compliance to periodic stack testing, and \nnot the sole means of compliance, because some lime plant s will be able to meet the numeric \nstandard without temperature control, and other plants may have to employ controls other than temperature controls to meet the numerical standard .) \nNLA suggests adding the following language to Table 6, Line 22: \nAs an alternative compliance method to the performance testing specified above, a source may \nperform annual testing for a period of three years  to establish a site -specific temperature of \ngases entering the inlet to the air pollution control device at which the numerical standard for dioxins/furans is met. Subsequently the source may rely on parametric temperature monitoring  \non a 30-day rolling average, and further performance testing is not required. \n \nXXII.  D/F\u2014REQUIRED TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nIf EPA chooses to promulgate a numerical emissions standard for dioxins and furans, the \nfollowing technical corrections should be made. \n \nA. EPA Has Properly  Corrected  the Proposed D/F E missions B ased on EPA\u2019s \nProposed D/F T esting R equirements.   \n In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed a limit on D/F based on EPA\u2019s \nJohnson memo.\n37 To properly utilize Reference Image 4 -3 to obtain a limit, the stack gas sample \nvolume, in dry standard cubic meter (dscm), is required to select the appropriate 3xRDL value. NLA pointed out in comments that EPA\u2019s proposed D/F limit was  set incorrectly in that it \n \n36 These variations are also the reason no temperature -based work practice has been identified that  would be \npracticable for the lime industry.  \n37 See Reference Image 4 -3: EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117.

EPA has recognized this issue and  has corrected the D/F limit to  0.037 ng/dscm  \nin the 2024 Proposed Rule . NLA commends EPA for this correction.  \n \nB. The TEF in Table 1 1 of the Proposed Rule  Redline  and EPA\u2019s 2010 TEF \nDocket D ocument D o Not M atch.   \n \nIn the preamble  to the new Proposed Rule , EPA states the following:  \n \nAdditionally, the EPA is incorporating by reference EPA/100/R \u2013 10/005, \n\u2018\u2018Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) for Human Health Risk \nAssessments of 2, 3, 7, 8 - Tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like Compounds,\u2019\u2019 \nDecember 2010, which is the s ource of the toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) for dioxins \nand furans used in calculating the toxic equivalence quotient of the proposed dioxin and furan standard.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9103.  \n \nTable 2 of the December 2010 document  referenced in the preamble provides the \nrecommended TEFs for D/F that are apparently incorporated by reference. However, Table 11 in  \nthe Proposed Rule  redline contains incorrect  TEF factors  from 1989. This disparity could create \nconfusion in future testing for D/F and should be corrected.\n \n \nAlso note that in the definitions section of the docket redline ( \u00a763.7143), the definition of \nTEQ refers to Table 10, when it should refer to Table 11.38 \n \nCOMMENTS ON MONITORING  \n \nAs noted above , NLA supports EPA\u2019s decision to base monitoring on periodic stack \ntesting and parametric monitoring. However, some adjustments to the proposed parametric \nmonitoring are needed.  \n XXIII.  EPA SHOULD MODIFY PARAMETRIC MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  \nFOR PERIODS OF STARTUP  AND SHUTDOWN  \nThe Proposed Rule  requires sources to comply with emissions  limits  and operating limits \nat all times , except during startup and shutdown as indicated in Table 2 of the docket redline . \nEven though NLA endorse s the use of periodic stack test and parametric monitoring to \ndemonstrate continuous compliance, the Proposed Rule  does not appropriately address how \noperating limits will be met during lime kiln startup or shutdown  for kilns using dry sorbent \ninjection , ACI or thermal oxidizers . During these periods, sorbent and carbon cannot be injected \nat the same rates as during normal operations , and operating conditions for RTOs differ as well . \n \n \n38 Note that if Table 9, referring to emissions averaging, is deleted as NLA suggests, the TEQ table would again be \nTable 10.  EPA should make sure the definition reference is consistent with the table number.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 61 NLA requests that EPA add the following (new) language to Table 2  to address \napplicable operating limits in the Proposed Rule s during startup and shutdown. \n \n5. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use dry \nsorbent injection or carbon injection during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 operating limits for sorbent and/or carbon injection do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that sorbent or carbon injection is in operation until the uni t is no \nlonger in startup or shutdown. During startup and shutdown, the control device shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating \nprocedure for startup and shutdown events. \n \n6. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use a thermal oxidizer during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 temperature limits for a thermal oxidizer do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that the thermal oxidizer is in operation until the unit is no longer in startup or shutdown.\n During startup and shutdown, the control \ndevice shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating procedure for \nstartup and shutdown events. \n \n \nXXIV.  EPA SHOULD PERMIT USE OF APPROVED MONITORING APPROACHES (SUCH AS BAG LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS ) DURING STARTUP AND \nSHUTDOWN  \n In the 2020 Lime MACT RTR rulemaking, EPA incorporated new requirements for \nstartup and shutdown of kilns as it related to existing visible emissions standards  for PM . \nHowever, the final rulemaking did not specify how kilns already using approved monitoring systems other than continuous opacity monitoring systems  (COMS ), such as bag leak detection \nsystems (BLDS), during normal operations should comply during startup and shutdown events.  \n \nKilns in the lime industry have used BLDS  (and other approved methods)  for continuous \ncompliance standards under the Lime MACT since its original inception in lieu of COMS. EPA, however, in several  instances, has disapproved applications for Alternative Monitoring \napproaches  proposing that a BLDS, like a COM, be allowed during s tartup/ shutdown events. \nEPA should clarify this issue now and should make it clear that a n approved method such as \nBLDS may be used during s tartup/ shutdown events as they are allowed for use under normal \noperation. Therefore, NLA request s that  the following provision be added to \u00a763.7090(c) of the \nregulation to clearly authorize use of these methods  during s tartup/ shutdown events : \n \nWhen a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown, a lime kiln may use any method approved for use \nto show continuous compliance during normal operations (such as a bag leak detection system) to demonstrate proper operation of the baghouse as a surrogate to demonstrating compliance with visible emission limits during these events.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 62 XXV.  EPA SHOULD ADJUST LANGUAGE IN \u00a763.7113 \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (h)(2) and (3) of the redline, EPA, in reference to monitors used to measure \ninjection rates, states that the device should be installed and calibrated \u201cin accordance with the \nmanufacturer's procedures and specifications.\u201d In some cases, manufacturers\u2019 procedures and specifications are unavailable or out of date, or  are otherwise incomplete or inapplicable. NLA \nrequests that EPA add the phrase \u201cor other applicable procedures  (such as industry standards or \nbest practices)  to ensure proper operation of the  device. \u201d \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (i)(3), EPA states that \u201c The calibration reference for the temperature \nmeasurement must be a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated reference \nthermocouple -potentiometer system or alternate reference, subject to approval by the \nAdministrator .\u201d NLA notes that it would be preferable for this section to call for  the \nmeasurement to be \u201ccalibrated to a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable \ncertified reference thermocouple,\u201d because such traceable certified reference thermocouples are more readily available.  \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (4), the term \u201cand other temperature sensors\u201d should be deleted. NLA is not \naware of temperature sensors other than thermocouples in use in this application. \n \nXXVI.  EPA SHOULD ADD CLARFYING LANGUAGE TO \u00a763.711 2(d) \n \nIn \u00a763.7112(d) , EPA adds language on test runs for performance tests. NLA believes that \nthe language on test duration could cause some confusion, and recommends that EPA revise the \nlast sentence in the section to read \u201cEach test run must last at least 1 hour for PM testing or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM.\u201d Alternatively, EPA could incorporate the 1 hour test run requirement for PM testing into Table 5 (as with the duration \nrequirement for other HAPs), and simply revise the language in (d) to \u201cThe duration of each test run shall be as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.\u201d  \n \nADDITIONAL COMMENTS  AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nXXVII.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT THE EQUATION FOR CALCULATING HCl \nAND MERCURY LBS/TON OF LIME PRODUCED EMISSION RATES  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposed redline text includes Equation 4 in Section 63.7112(n) to calculate the \nHCl and Hg emission rates in pounds  per ton of lime produced for HCl and pounds  per million \ntons of lime produced for Hg.  The equation is  stated in the redline  as follows : \n \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58+ \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)\n\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c   where,  \n \nE = Emission rate of mercury, pounds per million tons (lb/MMton) of lime produced or \nHCl per ton (lb/ton) of lime produced  \n Ck = Concentration in the kiln effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd)  \n Qk = Volumetric flow rate of kiln gas effluent (dscf/hr)  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 63 Qc = Volumetric flow rate of cooler effluent gas, dscf/hr. This value is zero if there is not \na separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nCc = Concentration in the cooler effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd).  This \nvalue is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nP = Stone production rate (ton/hr) for HCl and (MMton/hr) for Hg. K = Conversion factor, for mercury 2.2 x 10\n-9 \u00b5g/lb.  For HCl 9.20 x 10-8 ppmvd HCl per \nlb/dscf HCl.  \n Careful review of this equation  has determined that the conversion factor units for HCl and \nmercury are incorrect.  Also, as noted in section IX above, calculation of HAP emission rates \nfrom coolers other than PM is unnecessary and should be deleted. Therefore, t o calculate the \ncorrect emission rate, the follow revisions should be made to the equation: \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38=  \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc72(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58)\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c    where,  \nK = Conversion factor \nMercury conversion factor = 2.2 x 10-9 lb/\u00b5g . \nHCl conversion factor = 9.20 x 10-8 lb/dscf HCl per ppmvd HCl . \nOther terms are as defined above. \n The corrected equation  includes K in the numerator, not the denominator, emissions rate \ncalculations from coolers have been dropped, and conversion factor units have been corrected. \nEPA should update equation 4 accordingly. Note: If EPA sets an HBEL for HCl, this formula \nwould not be necessary for HCl, and would apply only to mercury.  \n \nXXVIII.  EPA SHOULD PROVIDE THAT TESTING TO RESET OPERATING \nLIMITS DOES NOT VIOLATE STANDARDS   \n \nThe Proposed Rule states that operating limits must be complied with at all times  (except \nto a limited extent  during startup and shutdown). However, operators when seeking to reset \noperating limits require the ability to reset at the appropriate level at the time of the test, which \nmay be at a different  level than the prior operating limit. The rule should clarify that a source is \nallowed to deviate from an existing operating limit when conducting a subsequent engineering evaluation or performance test. The rule should include the following language in \u00a763.7100 (a), and in  the definition of \u201cDeviation\u201d in 63.7143: \n \nHowever, when a lime kiln emissions control device is being evaluated for engineering \npurposes or for performance testing purposes, the existing operating limits for the control device do not apply and variance from current operating limits is not a deviation. \n \n \nXXIX.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT LANGUAGE REFERRING TO SCRUBBERS  \n \nThe Proposed Rule misconstrues the difference between a PM (typically venturi) type \nscrubber and a WPTGA used to control acid gases which a lime kiln may need to install to \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 64 comply with the new requirements of this rulemaking. This apparently led EPA to erroneously \ndelete some references to PM in the rule language, when those references are intended to make \nclear that the provisions refer to scrubbers used to control PM. EPA should clarify the Proposed \nRule  by retaining all references to PM scrubbers in the existing rule language  and ensure that \nreferences to setting parameter limits for PM scrubbers or acid gas scrubbers explicitly state that establishing operating parameters only apply when conducting performance tests for the specific \npollutant being measured.  \n \nFor example, in Table 5, lines 8, 9, 14, and 15, deleting the scrubber flow rate reference \nto PM could imply that the PM scrubber flow rate requirement is to be reset for a performance \ntest of any regulated HAP in the rule when it should only apply when completing a PM limit \nperformance test.  The same is the case for Table 3 lines 2 and 4, and Table 6 lines 1 and 3. The \nreference to PM should be retained in each of those provisions . \n \nXXX.  IN TABLE 5, ROW 6, THERE IS A REFER ENC E \u201cREFER TO NOTE 1\u201d THAT \nAPPEARS TO BE INCORRECT  \n \nRow  6 on Table 5 (addressing PM) in the docket redline includes, in the third column, the \nreference \u201cRefer to Note 1.\u201d Note 1 , however, relates to utilizing ASTM D6384- 12e1 for HCl \nand organic testing  and does not appear to be relevant to Row 6. The reference in Row 6 should \nbe corrected or deleted.  \n \nXXXI.  EPA SHOULD SIMPLIFY THE DEFINTION OF DRY SORBENT INJECTION \n \nThe definition of dry sorbent injection in \u00a763.7143 refers to use of this technology \u201c to \nreact with and neutralize acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl), Hg, organic HAP, or dioxin furans .\u201d \nNLA believes that this language should be simplified to refer only to HAPs being regulated in this rule, and thus should read \u201c\u201dto react with and neutralize HCl, Hg, organic HAP, or dioxins and furans.\u201d  \n \nXXXII.  EPA SHOULD REVISE TABLE S 3, 4 AND 6 TO INCLUDE PARALLEL \nLANGUAGE ON REQUIREMENTS  AND TO CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS.  \n \nLine 7 of Table 3 in the redline  should be revised to require \u201c flow rate greater than or \nequal to the flow rate operating limit,\u201d to parallel similar language in Line 8.  \n Table 3, Lines 7 and 8 should be revised to add the words \u201c for the applicable pollutant\u201d \nto the end to reflect  that not all pollutants will necessarily be tested in each performance test.  \nSimilarly, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should be added to Table 4, Line 1, before the term \u201cperformance test.\u201d In Table 6, Lines 7 and 8, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should also be added before \nthe term \u201cperformance test.\u201d (These suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cblueline.\u201d)  \n \nXXXIII.  TABLE 5 SHOULD BE REVISED FOR CLARITY \n \nTable 5, Line 20, should be revised to make clear that there are different required test \ndurations for different test methods . See the NLA blueline for suggested language.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 65  \nXXXIV.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT A TYPO IN TABLE 4  \n \nTable 4, Line  1 refers to measuring mercury using \u201cMethod 29 or 30B 5D in appendix A \nto part 60\u201d and measuring Total Organic HAP \u201cusing Method 18 5D in appendix A to part 60\u201d.  \nIn both cases the use of 5D appears to be a typographical error and should be deleted. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nNLA appreciates the opportunity to comment on these important issues.   \nVery truly yours,  \n \n William C.

The general  duty to minimize  emissions  does not require the owner or operator to \nmake any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring \nresults, review of operation and  maintenance  procedures,  review  of operation and maintenance records,  \nand inspection  of the source.  \n(d) You must prepare and implement for each LMP,  a written  operations, maintenance,  and \nmonitoring (OM&M) plan. You must submit the plan to the applicable permitting authority for \nreview and approval as part of the application for a 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 permit.

Beginning [DATE OF  PUBLICATION \nOF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], each performance test must include \nthe methods specified in rows 19-24 of Table 5 to this subpart . Performance tests for the \nemission standards promulgated in this rule , including PM emission standards and emissions \nstandards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at the same time.  On and after the relevant \ncompliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), each performance test must be \nconducted based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating \nconditions) of the affected source and under the specific conditions in Table 5 to this subpart. \nRepresentative conditions exclude periods of sta rtup and shutdown. The owner or operator may not  \nconduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator  must  record the process \ninformation that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include  in such record  \nan explanation to support that such conditions represent  normal operation. Upon request, the owner or \noperator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the \nconditions of performance tests. \n(c) Prior to the relevant compliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), you \nmay not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as \nspecified  in \u00a763.7(e)(1).

Each  test run must last \nat least 1 hour for PM testing  or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM . \n13  \n \n (e) The emission rate of particulate matter (PM) from each lime kiln (and each lime cooler \nif there is a separate exhaust  to the atmosphere  from  the lime cooler)  must  be computed for each \nrun using Equation 1 of this section:  \n \nWhere:  \nE = Emission rate  of PM, pounds  per ton (lb/ton)  of stone feed.  \nCk = Concentration of  PM in  the kiln effluent, grain/dry standard  cubic  feet (gr/dscf).  \nQk = Volumetric  flow  rate of  kiln effluent  gas, dry standard  cubic feet  per hour (dscf/hr).  \n \nCc = Concentration of PM in the cooler  effluent,  grain/dscf. This value  is zero  if there  is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n \nQc = Volumetric  flow rate of cooler  effluent  gas, dscf/hr.  This value  is zero if there is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n P = Stone  feed rate,  tons  per hour (ton/hr).  \n \nK = Conversion factor, 7000 grains  per pound (grains/lb).  \n \n(f)(1) If you choose to meet a weighted average emission limit as specified in item 4 of \nTable 1 to this subpart, you must  calculate a combined particulate  emission  rate from  all kilns \nand coolers within your LMP using Equation 2 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \n \nET = Emission rate  of PM from  all kilns and coolers,  lb/ton of  stone feed.  \nEi = Emission  rate of PM from  kiln i, or from  kiln/cooler  combination i, lb/ton of stone  feed. \nPi = Stone feed rate to kiln i, ton/hr.  \nn = Number of  kilns you wish to  include  in averaging. \n \n(2) You do not have  to include  every  kiln in this calculation,  only include  kilns  you wish  to \n\n14  \n \n average. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(g) The weighted  average PM emission  limit from  all kilns  and coolers  for which  you are \naveraging must be calculated using Equation 3 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \nETN = Weighted  average PM  emission  limit  for all kilns  and coolers  being included in averaging \nat the LMP, lb/ton of stone feed.  \nEj = PM emission  limit (0.10 or 0.12)  for kiln j, or for kiln/cooler  combination j, lb/ton  of stone \nfeed.  \nPj = Stone  feed rate to  kiln j, ton/hr.  \nm = Number of kilns and kiln/cooler combinations you are averaging at your LMP. You must \ninclude  the same kilns  in the calculation  of ET and ETN. Kilns  that have  a PM emission \nlimit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(h) Performance  test results  must  be documented in complete  test reports  that contain  the \ninformation required by paragraphs (h)(1) through (10) of this section, as well as all other \nrelevant information. The plan to be followed during testing must be made available to the Administrator at least 60 days prior to testing.  \n(1) A brief  description of  the process  and the  air pollution  control system;  \n(2) Sampling  location  description(s);  \n \n(3) A description of sampling  and analytical  procedures  and any modifications  to standard \nprocedures;  \n(4) Test results, including opacity;  \n \n(5) Quality  assurance procedures  and results;  \n \n(6) Records  of operating conditions  during the test, preparation  of standards,  and calibration \n\n15  \n \n procedures;  \n(7) Raw data sheets  for field  sampling  and field  and laboratory analyses;  \n \n(8) Documentation of calculations;  \n \n(9) All data recorded and  used to establish operating limits; and  \n \n(10) Any other information  required by the test method. \n \n(i) [Reserved]  \n \n(j) You must establish any applicable 3-hour block average operating limit indicated in \nTable 3 to this subpart according  to the applicable requirements  in Table 4  to this subpart and \nparagraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section. \n(1) Continuously record  the parameter  during the PM performance  test and include the  \n \nparameter  record(s) in the performance test report.  \n \n(2) Determine  the average  parameter  value for  each 15 -minute  period of each test  run. \n \n(3) Calculate the test run average for the parameter  by taking the average of all  the 15- \nminute parameter values for the run. \n(4) Calculate the 3-hour operating limit by taking the average of the three test  run averages.  \n \n(k) For each building enclosing any PSH operations that is subject  to a VE limit,  you must \nconduct a VE check according to item 18 in Table 5 to this subpart, and in accordance with \nparagraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. \n(1) Conduct visual inspections that consist of a visual survey of the building over the test \nperiod to identify if there are VE, other than condensed water vapor. \n(2) Select  a position at least 15 but not more  1,320 feet from  each  side of the building with \nthe sun or other light source generally at your back. \n(3) The observer conducting the VE checks  need  not be certified  to conduct EPA  Method 9 \nin appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter. However, the observer must meet the training \n16  \n \n requirements as described in EPA Method 22 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. \n(l) When  determining  compliance with the opacity standards for fugitive emissions  from \nPSH operations in item 8 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct EPA Method 9 in \nappendix A-4 to  part 60 of this  chapter  according  to item 17 in  Table 5 to  this subpart, and  in \naccordance with paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section.  \n(1) The minimum distance between  the observer  and the emission  source shall  be 4.57 \nmeters (15 feet).  \n(2) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from \nother fugitive emission  sources  (e.g., road  dust). The required  observer position  relative  to the \nsun must be followed. \n(3) If you use wet dust suppression to control PM from PSH operations, a visible mist is \nsometimes  generated  by the spray. The  water  mist must not be confused with  particulate  matter \nemissions  and is not to be considered VE. When  a water  mist of this nature is present,  you must \nobserve emissions at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible. \n(m) On and after the relevant  compliance date for your source as specified  in \u00a763.7083( eg), \nduring startup, kilns must  be tested hourly to determine when lime product meets the definition \nof on-specification lime product. \n(n) An LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all  lime kilns is \nbelow 300 tpy and submit this with a  Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS)  before the \ncompliance date. The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test \non each lime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of pound per ton of lime produced multiplied by annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl for all kilns at the site. If the LMP includes any kilns requiring add-on controls to comply with the HBEL, the operator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating \n17  \n \n parameter for other controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain \ncompliance with the HBEL.

The exhaust  may be \nan open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.  \nOn-specification  Lime  Product  means  lime product  that has been  sufficiently  calcined  to \nmeet end use requirements.  \nParticulate  matter  (PM) detector  means  a system  that is continuously capable of monitoring \nPM loading in the exhaust of FF or ESP in order to detect bag leaks, upset conditions, or control device malfunctions and sounds an alarm at a  preset level. A PM detector system includes, but is \nnot limited  to, an  instrument  that operates  on triboelectric,  light  scattering,  light  transmittance,  or \nother effects to continuously monitor relative particulate loadings. A BLDS is a type of PM detector.  \n52  \n \n Positive  pressure  FF or ESP  means  a FF or ESP with  the fan(s) on the upstream  side of the \ncontrol device. \nProcess stone handling operations means the equipment and transfer points between the \nequipment used to transport processed stone, and includes, storage bins, conveying system \ntransfer  points, bulk loading or unloading systems,  screening  operations, bucket elevators,  and \nbelt conveyors. \nProcessed  stone means  limestone  or other calcareous  material  that has been  processed  to a \nsize suitable for feeding into a lime kiln.  \nScreening operation means a device for separating material according to size by passing \nundersize material  through one or more  mesh  surfaces  (screens)  in series  and retaining  oversize \nmaterial on the mesh surfaces (screens).  \nShutdown means  the cessation  of kiln operation. Shutdown begins when  feed to the kiln is \nreduced below planned production quantities and ends when stone feed is halted and fuel \ncombustion from the main burner ceases. \nStack emissions means  the PM that is released  to the atmosphere from  a capture system  or \ncontrol device. \nStartup means  the beginning of kiln operation. Startup  begins when  a shutdown kiln begins \nfiring fuel in the main burner. Startup ends when the lime kiln first generates on- specification \nlime product or 12 hours following first discharge from the kiln, whichever is earlier. \nStone produced refers  to the production of limestone  from  the lime kiln consisting of high- \ncalcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \nStorage bin means  a manmade enclosure for storage (including surge bins) of processed \nstone prior to the lime kiln.  \nTEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity equivalents for dioxins and \n53  \n \n furans as defined in EPA/100/R-10/005, \u201c Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) \nfor Human Health Risk Assessments of 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like \nCompounds \u201d, December  2010 (incorporated by reference\u2014see  \u00a763.14). The Toxic Equivalency \nFactors (TEFs) used to determine the dioxin and furan TEQs are listed in Table 10 of this \nsubpart.  \nTotal Organic HAP  means,  for the purposes of this subpart, the sum of the concentrations of \ncompounds of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, and naphthalene as measured by EPA Test Method 320 or Method 18 of appendix A to this part or ASTM D6348\u201303[1] or a combination of these methods, as appropriate. If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection  \nlevel (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), a value of zero (0) should be used you must use the \nmethod detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total \norganic HAP value. The measured  result  for a multiple  component analysis  (e.g., analytical  \nvalues  for multiple  Method 18 fractions) may include a combination of method detection level \ndata and analytical data reported above th e method detection level. The owner or operator of an \naffected source may request the use of other test methods to make this determination under paragraphs 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f) of this part.  \nTransfer point means  a point in a conveying operation where the material  is transferred  to \nor from a belt conveyor. \nVent means an opening through which there is mechanically induced air flow for the \npurpose of exhausting from  a building air carrying  PM emissions  from  one or more  emission \nunits. \n \n54  \n \n Table 1 to  Subpart  AAAAA of Part  63\u2014Emission Limits  \nAs required  in \u00a763.7090(a), you must meet  each emission  limit in the following  table  that \napplies to you, except for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown (See Table 2 for \nemission limits for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown). \n \nFor . . .

If, at  any time \nafter January 5, 2004, the kiln changes to a dry control \nsystem, then the PM emission limit in item 1 of this \nTable  1 applies,  and the kiln is hereafter  ineligible  for the \nPM emission limit in item 2 of this Table 1 regardless of \nthe method of PM control.  \n3. All nNew lime kilns and their \nassociated lime coolers  PM emissions  must  not exceed  0.10 lb/tsf.  \n4.

It is found in household products such as \ncleaners and swimming pool additives and is formed during the burning of many plastics.  HCl is \nconsidered one of the most important ba sic industrial chemicals.  Mean air exposure to HCl in \noccupational settings has been estimated by IARC as ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 \nduring acid treatment of metals , while m ean exposures during other industrial processes are \nestimated as >1 mg/m3. Ambient air levels of HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3. \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulf uric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl was that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore assessed \nexposure to HCl as not classifiable as to it s carcinogenicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d).  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that \nmany individua ls classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that \nincluded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  When exposures are mixed, \nthe substance contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome  (e.g., \nsulfuric acid in mixed acid mists) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. Mixed \nexposures or chance are the likely explanation s for the sporadic  positive associations with cancer \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containin g HCl.  All occupational epidemiology \nstudies published since the 1992 IARC  determination are consistent with this conclusion.  \nThe available toxicological evidence also is consistent with the human data, i.e., it does not \nindicate that HCl is carcinogenic or mutagenic, and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types \nof cell proliferation that are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens . The only chronic \nexposure study  reported increased  incidence of  hyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferatio n) in the \nlarynx and trachea of rats exposed to 10 ppm HCl as compared to controls , but no excess cancer \nwas observed.  Hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure \nconcentrations below the threshold at which hyperplasia was reported. Two  short term cancer \nstudies in experimental animals reported that neither dermal nor oral exposures resulted in an \nincrease in cancers.  The available toxicology studies also did not provide evidence of genotoxicity \nor mutagenicity resulting fro m HCl exposures (as reviewed by Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development). Furthermore, in studies where HCl was administered along with \nformaldehyde, exposures to 10 ppm HCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d \nthe carcinoge nicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n2 HCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n1.INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (i.e., it is an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. The gas form may be designated as \nHCl(g) , and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air   (IARC 1992; ATSDR 2014; National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for \nBiotechnology Information 2024; ATSDR 2002) . On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white \nvapors due to condensation with atmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into \ncontact with moisture, it forms hydrochloric acid. Commercial concentrated hydrochloric acid  \ncontains 36% to 38% hydrogen chloride in water.  \nIn the early twentieth century, hydrogen chloride was created by burning hydrogen gas. This \nmethod created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between chloride salts and \nsulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC 1992) . A widely used industrial chemical,  HCl can \nalso be formed as a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in industrial manufacturing \nprocesses, for e xample from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime (CaO and MgO)  (IARC 1992; \nATSDR 2014; ATSDR 2002) . HCl can also  be found in many everyday products, including \nhousehold products such as cleaners and swimming pool additives (used to adjust the pH), and it \nis formed during the burning of many plastics.  Industrial uses of HCl include pickling, \nelectroplating metals, tanni ng leather, cleaning, and the production of a wide variety of products . \nHCl is also formed naturally in events like volcano eruptions. HCl is one of the most widely used \nchemicals in industrial processes , and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA ) estimates that about 1,239,000 American workers are potentially exposed to HCl (as \ncited in IARC 1992) . People are exposed to HCl in the ambient air , although concentrations  are \ntypically below 0.01 mg/m3 (as cited in IARC 1992) . \nBased on communication wit h the National Lime Association (personal communication), HCl \nemitted from lime kilns controlled with a dry air pollution control device (APCD) is in the vapor \n(gas) phase. This is because the gas exit temperature (~400 degrees F) is well above any \nthresho ld where acid mist could exist 0F1. This has been verified with industry stack test data \nobtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing, which confirm the presence of HCl as a \ngas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are controlled with dry \nAPCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions in the form of mists are expected \nto be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water.  \n1.2 Residual Risk , Technology Review , and Health -Based Exposure Limits  \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US -EPA) regulates \n1 As we discuss later, the carcinogenicity evidence for acids involves acid mists specifically . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n3 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022In the first  stage,  section 112(d) requires the US-EPA to develop technology -based\nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each\ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) . 1F2\n\u2022In the second stage, US-EPA is required under section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and\nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If\nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of\nsafety or to prevent an adverse environmental effect, US-EPA must develop  standards to\naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as\nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US-EPA issued MACT\nstandards, the residual risk stage must be completed within eight years of promulgation\nof the  initial technology -based standard .\nUnder section 112(d)(6), US-EPA also must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight yea rs and revise them, as necessary, taking into account developments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US-EPA will revise the rule s. For efficiency, the US-EPA includ es the \n112(f) and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory package and calls the rulemakings the Risk \nand Technology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US-EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is ba sed on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emi ssions information).\u201d  \nAs outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based \nthreshold, assuming such a threshold has been established. The US-EPA will not approve a \nhealth -based threshold for a MACT standard if a HAP is a  carcinogen.  As part of the statutory \nlime manufacturing risk and technology review, US-EPA conducted an inhalation risk assessment \nfor HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and found no unacceptable human health risk \nunder worst case emissions scen arios ( 84 FR 48,723 (Sep. 16, 2019) ). The US-EPA risk \nassessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a variety of human -health risk \nscreening benchmarks as part of risk calculations.  \nIn its pre -proposed rule announced in the February 9, 2024 Federal Register (Vol 89, No. 28), \nUS-EPA requested public comment on a potential health -based exposure limit (HBEL) for HCl. To \nregulate  exposure levels using an HBEL, the chemical in question must be identified as a non -\ncarcinogen . The specific scientific issues that the National Lime Association requested Ramboll to \nconsider are as follows:  \n1.Evidence  related to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl .\n2.Whether  the scientific community has judged there to be an established threshold for\nhealth effects  associated with HCl exposure .\n3.The estimated margin of safety associated with the proposed threshold .\n2 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n4 2.METHODS\n2.1 General a pproach  \nRambo ll review ed and synthesize d the scientific literature regarding the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nand provided a report to NLA in June 2021 . Our 2021 assessment of HCl carcinogenicity \nincorporated previous assessments by  the World Health Organization Internationa l Agency for \nResearch on Cancer ( IARC), the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n(OECD ), and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) that we updated with \ninformation identified through literature search es to identify information available after the \npublication dates for those agency reports . We concluded that the newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence , and, t aking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  As a follow -up to \nRamboll\u2019s June 2021 report, Ramboll has undertaken the following activities:  \n1.To comment on the evidence related to  the potential for HCl to be a carcinogen,  we\nconducted new searches of the literature to identify any assessments of the risks\nassociated with HCl exposure that had been conducted by authoritative bodies  or that\nhad been published in individual research s tudies since January 2021. This time interval\ndeliberately overlaps with the period covered in Ramboll\u2019s previous review, in order to\nidentify material published in early 2021 whose indexing had been delayed.  We reviewed\nall new information to determine if  it provided evidence in conflict with our prior\nconclusions, or if it supported our prior conclusions.\n2.After incorporating new information into our prior assessment of the evidence, we\nabstracted all quantitative exposure data we identified to date  (i.e., including sources\nidentified for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report)  to determine if there was evidence for a threshold\nbelow which health effects were not observed  (no observed adverse effect level\n[NOAEL ]/lowest observed adverse effect level [LOAEL]). We documented this\ninformation, along with any specific health -related  outcomes investigated in association\nwith these exposure levels.\n3.We developed comments on the quality, quantity, and certainty of the evid ence thus\nsummarized , and discussed the ability to consider the conclusions  regarding a threshold\nfor health effects to be \u201cestablished\u201d .\n4.To comment on the estimated margin of safety in US -EPA\u2019s pre -proposed rule, we\nreview ed US-EPA air modeling methods to  verify the ir methods and underlying\nassumptions were scientifically supported . In addition, we r eviewed the calculations and\nassumptions underlying the reference concentration values (RfC) estimated by California\nEPA and US -EPA to determine which  approach  was more appropriate .\n2.2 Identifying Relevant Literature \nWe implemented the same search strategies documented in Ramboll\u2019s  June 2021 report to NLA \nto verify that we were able to identify the same body of relevant literature cited in 2021 and to \nupdate those searches with material published between 2021 and February 2024. We enhanced \nboth literature search es as described in section 2.2.2  and 2.2.3, below .  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n5 2.2.1  Updated assessments of HCl by authoritative bodies  \nWe checked for HCl assessments by the following authoritative bodies , focusing on material \npublished since 2021 : IARC, OECD, IPCS , the US Environmental Protection Agency ( US-EPA), the \nNational Toxicology Program (NTP), the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  \n(ATSDR),  The California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Environmental  Health \nHazard Assessment  (OEHHA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), The European Food Safety \nAuthority (EFSA), and the National Institute of Health (NIH) .  \n2.2.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature  \nTo identify studies of humans with potential occupational exposure to HCl, w e searched PubMed , \nusing  combinations of the following search terms: \u201coccupational\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \n\u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \n\u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -control\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d , clinical studies \nwere filtered out of the search to remove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s. We additionally \nsearched for epidemiology studies published since 2021 that had cited any of the literature \nreferenced in the IARC and OECD assessments that were the initial basis of Ramboll\u2019s 2021 \nreport.  \n2.2.3  Targeted PubMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nTo identify relevant toxicological data, including animal studies and studies of mutagenicity, we \nsearched PubMed  using combinations of the following search t erms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \n\u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201cchronic bioassay\u201d; and \u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d . To enhance our searches of \nthe toxicological literature, we included the terms \"cancer\", \"carcinogenicity\", and \"malignant\" \ncombined with the chemical names , and we also constructed searches combining  the chemical \nnames with the terms \"genotoxicity\" , \"mutagenicity\" , \"hyperplasia\" , and \"cell proliferation\" . \n2.2.4  Exclusion criteria  \nWe excluded p ublications  at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed in \nthe study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the test material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxi city study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3.RESULTS\n3.1 Evidence related to the p otential carcinogenicity of HCl  \n3.1.1  Restatement of previous conclusions  \nIn our 2021 report to NLA, Ramboll concluded there was no evid ence for HCl to be a carcinogen  \nbased on a review of the assessments conducted by IARC, OECD , and ICPS and incorporating \ninformation we identified in publications post -dating those assessments . Our 2021 evaluation of \nthe evidence  included  investigations of potential cancer associations  based on occupational \nepidemiology studies, and supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity studies and studies \nthat assessed the potential for HCl to induce cell proliferation.   \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n6 The occupational epidemiology studies (summarized in Table A1, Appendix A ) were \nmethodologically limited by their exposure assessment and categorization methods  that likely \nresulted in exposures that combined HCl with other industrial chemicals . The use of mixed \nexposure groups is particularly  germane, as the mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other \nstrong inorganic acid mists, which are classified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl \nand these other acids, any apparent association between HCl and cancer would be inflated due t o \nthe carcinogenic effect of exposure to the other acids. In spite of this confounding by mixed \nexposures, the results did not suggest an association  with cancer.  \nThe occupational epidemiology studies were also generally limited by inadequate control for \npotentially confounding , non-occupational  exposures, and small numbers of cases  that led to low \nstatistical power . Based on our assessment of the available evidence, Ramboll agreed with the \noverall conclusion by IARC that the small number of cancer cases ob served in various \noccupational cohorts likely represent sporadic cases and/or cases due to co-exposure by probable \nor known carcinogens , such as sulfuric and other  acid mists. \nThe genotoxicity studies  included in Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report  either indicat ed no genotoxic effect of \nHCl, or their results were deemed due to the acidic conditions of the experiments; the \nconcentrations of HCl that produced positive findings in these studies were higher than would be \nfound in the environment and are not relevant for the ambient air exposures that are the subject \nof the proposed HBEL.  Furthermore, w e did not find evidence that cell proliferation \u2013 which is \nsometimes involved  in the cancer process \u2013 is associated with  HCl exposure in in vitro  \ngenotoxicity  tests.  \n3.1.2  New literature : evidence related to the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nWe did not find any relevant toxicology studies nor additional analyses published by authoritative \nbodies that were missing from Ramboll\u2019s 2021 rep ort or that had been published since 2021.  \nWe identified three occupational epidemiology studies  published in 2021 or later.  Chen et al. \n(2021)  conducted a case -control study in south ern China based on self-reported data collected \nthrough in-person or telephone inte rviews.  The study comprised 2,514  cases and 2,586 c ontrols \nmatched on age, sex, and location.  Participants reported on work and health history and history \nof exposure to pot entially confounding factors . All exposures  to acid s and alkalis were grouped \ntogether , thereby introducing confounding of any potential HCl association by exposure to known \ncarcinogens.  The main analysis, which adjusted for potential confounders including  occupational \nexposure to other carcinogens,  provided an elevated risk estimate for nasopharyngeal cancers \n(odds ratio  (OR): 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30, 1.89) . A sub -analysis that focused on \nparticipants  categorized as ever or never exposed to sulfuric, hydrochloric and/or nitric acids \nadjusted for history of Epstein Barr virus infection  provided  an estimated OR for nasopharyngeal \ncancers of 1. 63 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.09) . Both estimates  are very likely driven by the co-expos ures \nto other acids that are classified as probable or known carcinogens . \nIn a study of 10,229  telecommunications workers (9,551 men) exposed to mixed acid mists, Ker \net al. (2021)  identified 52 deaths due to cancers of various types  (31 cancers of the digestive \nsystem, 7 lung cancers, 5 nasopharyngeal cancers, and 9 miscellaneous cancers: 3 leukemias, 1 \ncervical cancer, 1 urinary cancer, 1 thyroid cancer, 1 non -pancreatic endocrine cancer, 1 \nimmunological cancer, and 1 not specified) . Note that cancer is not one disease - different types \nof cancers have different causes (American Cancer Society 2022) . Standardized mortality ratios \n(SMR) estimated the risk  of each type of cancer observed in the study population compared with \nthe genera l population of Taiwan, where the study was conducted. All of the telecommunications \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n7 workers included in this study were exposed to mixed acids  that had been previously designated \nas probable or known  human carcinogens (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, ni tric acid ). After \ncontrolling for age, sex, and calendar year , there was no evidence of an increased risk of \nnasopharyngeal cancer  or lung cancer in the occupational cohort compared with the general \npopulation (i.e., SMR s adjusted for a five -year latency i nterval were 1.05 (p>0.99) and 0.76 \n(p=0.59), respectively ). There were some types of cancers with SMRs greater than one, but each \nhad only one to three  cases and none of these associations were statistically significant; these \nare likely to represent chance findings.  \n Moayedi -Nia et al.(2022)  published a case -control study of lung cancer nested in the Canad ian \nCARTaGENE cohort . The authors identified 147 lung cancer cases diagnosed between 20 09 and \n2016 and compared their exposure histories to the exposures reported by 1,032 non-cancer \ncontrols  based on the longest job held . Data were collected through telephone interviews and \nevaluated using CANJEM, the Canadian Job Exposure Matrix , to identify those who had no chance \nof exposure  (never exposed) , up to 25% certain ty of exposure  (ever) , and at least 25% certain ty \nof exposure (ever) to HCl based on job categor ies. After adjusting for age , smoking status, \nenvironmental tobacco smoke exp osure, family history, and ever/never exposure to all other \noccupational lung carcinogens  identified through CANJEM , participants ever occupationally \nexposed to HCl with at least 25% certainty had a n OR of 3.79 (95% CI 1.07 \u2013 13.41) for lung \ncancer compared to unexposed subjects , based on only five exposed  cases  (2 women and 3 \nmen) . The association was no longer statistically significant a fter adjustment for multiple \ncomparisons  to account for the many different potential health outcomes included in this \nanalysis , suggesting it may have been  a chance finding. There were too few cases to complete \nsex-stratified analyses . \n3.1.3  Incorporating new information into previous conclusions  for an overall \nassessment of evidence related to carcinogenicity of HCl  \nCombining the results of literature that we reviewed  for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and this one, we \nfound a total of 22 occupational epidemiology studies . The information included in the three \noccupational epidemiology studies that we identified with publication dates in 2021 or later does \nnot alter the conclusions  we reached in 2021 . Taken together, the results  of the available \nliterature did not suggest that occupational exposure to HCl increase d the risk of cancer .  \nTwo of the occupational epidemiology studies provided quantitative exposure data. Bond et al. \n(1991)  estimated cumulative and maximum average HCl exposures for subjects in a nested case -\ncontrol study concerning lung cancer mo rtality. Compared to subjects with no estimated  \nexposure, subjects with 2 ppm -years to 3.9 ppm -years  (0.15  to 5.81 mg/m3-year) 2F3, 4.0 to 12.4 \nppm-years  (5.96 , 18.48 mg/m3-year) , and 12.5 ppm -years (18.63 mg/m3-year) or greater \nshowed non -statistically significant risk ratios  of 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.6 ,1.3), 1.2 \n(95% CI: 0.8,1.9), and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6, 1.8), respectively. The re was no evidence of a trend  \nacross these groups (chi2 = 0.14, p = 0.35).  When categorized according to  maximum average \nexposures, compared to unexposed subjects, subjects with a maximum of less than 2 ppm (2.98 \nmg/m3*) showed a risk ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2) and subjects with a maximum of greater \nthan or equal to 2 ppm (2.98 mg/m3*) showed a  risk ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8,1.6). Neither \ncumulative exposures nor maximum average exposures yielded statistically significant results for \nany exposure level.  \n3 Here and elsewhere, conversions from p pm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n8 Coggon et al. (1996)  reported non -statisticall y significant results when analyzing aerodigestive \ncancer mortality and maximum acid mist exposure levels. Compared to unexposed subjects, \nsubjects ever exposed to less than 1 mg/ m3 showed an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI: 0.2, 15.8), \nand subjects exposed to 1  mg/m3 or greater showed an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.3, 5.7). \nNotably , the maximum exposures include sulfuric acid or HCl mists  rather than HCl exclusively , \nwhich is an important distinction because IARC concluded that HCl exposures other than mists \nwere not carcinogenic . Despite this  mixed exposure  (mixed acid mists) , the odds ratios reported \nby Coggon et al.  (1996)  were not statistically significant .   \nThe effects of HCl exposure ha ve also been investigated in animal studies ( see Appendix, Table \nA2). The carcinogenicity of HCl was examined in groups of 100 Sprague -Dawley  rats exposed by \ninhalation  to either  gaseous HCl, formaldehyde , two types of combinations of HCl and \nformaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week over 122 \nweeks  (Albert et al. 1982; Sellakumar 1985) . Results were also compared to those for unexposed \ncontrol animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) 3F4 in the HCl -only exposure. \nFollowing sacrifice, animals were examined fo r tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special \nattention to the respiratory tract. Results  of the study indicated increased  incidence of  \nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of animals exposed to HCl \nalone as compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed.   \nOther cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development 2002)  \u2013 a dermal exposure study (Narat, 1925 as cited by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  and an oral exposure study \n(Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . No \nmalignant tumors were reported  in 99 mice dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions \ncontaining 3 -5% HCl every 1-2 days , and then weekly for 4 -6 additional weeks (total exposure \nduration 25 -46 weeks) (Narat,1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment 2002) .  \nDyer et al.  (1946, as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  \norally exposed groups of mice to a combination of HCl (1 -2.5 moles per liter) and either a \n\u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene ( 40 mice) and reported n o \nexcess cancer or pre -cancerous lesions observed in the stomachs of animals from either group \nexposed to HCl. OECD concluded neither  study was appropriate for the assessment of \ncarcinogenicity because of the shortcomings of the stud y design .  \nAn important consideration when determining carcinogenicity is the ability of a chemical to induce \ngenotoxicity or mutagenicity. Genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals typically are not considered to  \nhave a threshold for their  effects to occur. HCl did not induce mutations in six bacterial mutation \nassays nor in one mutation assay in yeast cells (reviewed by IARC 1992; Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell \nsurvival in strains that have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two \nassays , but OECD concluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A weakly positive respo nse for \nmutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay; these results are interpreted as being \nan artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell culture medium), which itself related to cell \ndeath. Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cul tures were negative (IARC 1992; \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development  2002) . HCl induced chromosome \n4 Here and elsewhere, conversions from ppm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n9 aberrations in mammalian cells in culture at concentrations in excess of 10 mM in the cell culture \nmedia (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8) and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse  lymphoma cells, and in insect and plant cells . IARC (1992)  and OECD \n(2002)  found that the acidic pH is the responsible factor for these responses and that similar \nresponses are observed for other ino rganic acids and with acetic acid. These concentrations \nwould not be found environmentally and are thus not relevant for ambient air exposures to HCl.  \nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied, and very small numbers of cases of various types of cancers, which are expected to have \ndifferent causes and risk factors, have been identified. This is in spite of the high likelihood that \nindividuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that included \nrecognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Such mixed exposure groups would \nincorrectly assign risk to HCl if the risk were actually due to expos ure to the other chemicals that \nco-occurred with HCl. The small numbers of cases have resulted in very unstable risks estimated \nwith a high degree of uncertainty; in addition to the confounding effects of other exposures, \nchance cannot be ruled out as the cause of those findings.   \nHCl is a commonly used industrial chemical with a long history of use (IARC  1992) . Had there \nbeen a causal association between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have \nbeen raised and any potential association would have been more fully investigated. The small \nnumber of cases that have been detected in th e existing research base implies HCl is likely not a \ncarcinogen; the cases were most probably caused by co -exposures to known occupational \ncarcinogens and/or to uncontrolled confounding by non -occupational carcinogenic exposures, \nsuch as cigarette smoking.   \n3.2 Has the scientific community judged there to be a threshold for health effects \nassociated with HCl exposure? \nIt is logically impossible to prove a negative, i.e., that HCl does not cause cancer. \nHCl currently has many industrial uses, in the productio n of chlorides, fertilizers, and dyes, in the \nsteel, textile and rubber industries , in the production of numerous chemicals, making it one of \nthe most widely used chemicals in industrial processes  (IARC 1992) . Given its wide use in \nindustry, it can be inferred logically that occupational exposure to this chemical is common. Very \nlittle research on its c arcinogenicity has been carried out, however, suggesting that no or few \nsignals have emerged to indicate an elevated cancer risk associated with occupational exposure \nto HCl. This inference is borne out by the small numbers of cancer cases identified among  the \nthousands of occupationally exposed individuals included in the studies we identified (Table A1 in \nAppendix A)  and is supported by toxicological evidence indicating a lack of mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic activity by HCl.  \nSome substances may produce tumors through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing \nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations. \nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration below which no \neffects are see n. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed \nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was \nno evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985) . Furthermore, in studies where HCl was \nadministered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3)\nHCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n10 In conclusion, t he available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is \nmutagenic or carcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation \nthat are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal \nstudies indicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) led to increased incidence of \nhyperplasi a, hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations \nbelow the threshold  at which hyperplasia was reported .  \n3.3 Proposed margin of safety  \nThe US-EPA has derived a RfC for HC l of 0.2 mg/m3 (Table 1) based on the lowest adverse effect \nlevel (LOAEL) of 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3*) reported by Sellakumar et al. (1985) . The LOAEL is \nbased on the incidence of hyperplasia reported in rats chronic ally exposed to HC l via inhalation , \nand the assumption that a threshold concentration exists below which no  effects would be seen \nfollowing HC l exposure . US-EPA has designated \u201clow confidence\u201d in the current RfC based on the \nstudy used as the basis for the  RfC and the sparsity of the overall database for HC l (animal and \nhuman toxicity data). The study that serves as the basis for the RfC (Sellakumar 1985)  includes \nonly one treatment group and a control group. In a ddition, the supporting toxicity data includes \nonly subchronic toxicity studies with no additional chronic or reproductive toxicity data. Based on \nthe research completed for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and the review of both toxicology and \nepidemiology data completed from 2021 to the present, there are no additional data that could \nbe considered by US-EPA that could increase the confidence in the RfC at this time. More studies \nwould have to be conducted in order to increase confidence in the RfC, and they should include \nchronic exposures and reproductive endpoints . \nThe chronic REL (CREL) developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) , \nof 0.009 mg/m3 (Table 1) is also based  on the same ch ronic toxicity study (Sellakumar 1985)  \nthat serves as the basis for the RfC derived by US-EPA. While both the US-EPA and CalEPA \ntoxicity values are based on the same underlying  animal toxicity data and derived using similar \nmethodologies  there are significant differences in the two toxicity values with the CalEPA CREL \nbeing lower than US-EPA\u2019s RfC (RfC of 0.2 mg/m3 vs. CREL of 0.009 mg/m3). The difference  in \nthe values is related to the use of US-EPA\u2019s s guidance on  the dosimetry adjustment of inhalation \nof gases  (US-EPA 1994) . The dosimetric adjustment equation considers the surface area all \nregions of the respiratory t ract that are affected  (i.e., extrathoracic, tracheobronchial  and \npulmonary) .  When conducting the dosimetry adjustment, CalEPA only considered the \nextrathoracic surface area . However, consistent with the results reported by Sellakumar et al. \n(1985)  of increased hyperplasia in both the larynx and the trachea , US-EPA included the surface \narea of both the extrathoracic  and tracheobronchial  respiratory region. CalEPA  notes that while \nextrathoracic and tracheobronchi al effects were reported in rats following exposures to hydrogen \nchloride , the REL was based on extrathoracic effects because humans are predicted to be \nrelatively more susceptible to the effects of hydrogen chloride in that region.  However, no basis \nfor this prediction was presented by CalEPA. The US-EPA guidelines recommend that when  \neffects are observed in the mid -respiratory  tract (tracheobronchial ), this region should also  be \nconsidered in the dosimetry  adjustment calculations.  Therefore, US-EPA\u2019s approach for the \nderivation of the RfC aligns with the guidelines for dosimetric adjustments following inhalation of \ngases and  better represents  the observed respiratory effects reported  in the scientific literature.  \nUS-EPA conducted a risk assessment to determine an HBEL for HCl for the Lime Manufacturing \nsource category.  The purpose  of the assessment  was to determine the level of HCl emissions that \nwould ensure health thresholds are not exceeded with an ample margin of safety . Unit emission s \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n11 of one ton per year of HC l along with emission release parameters for each facility  were used to \nestimate the HBEL . Inhalation exposure concentrations and potential health risks were estimated \nusing US-EPA\u2019s Human Exposure Model (HEM4) , which incorporates the American Meteorological \nSociety/ US-EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) dispersion modeling system (AERMOD version \n22112) , a Gaussian plume dispersion model for modeling point, area, and volume sources of \ncontinuous air emissions  (USEPA 2005) .  \nUS-EPA provides details of the risk assessment and HBEL estimation in a  memo, \u201cRisk Approach \nto Assess a Health -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for the Lime Manufacturing \nSource Category\u201d ( US-EPA Docket: EPA -HQ-OAR-2017-0015). The reported inputs for the air \nmodeling were conservative . Unit emissions of 1 ton per year ( tpy) of HCl assigned to each \nfacility  were used as input into HEM4 to estimate the maximum ambient chronic concentration , \nwhich were th en scaled up by a factor of 300 to assess chronic and acute risks. A default hourly \nacute emissions multiplier of 10 was appl ied to reflect 1 -hour emissions ten times the annual \nemissions level divided by 8 ,760 hours per year.  Annual concentrations were estimated to assess \nchronic health impacts and 1 -hour concentrations were estimated to assess acute health impacts. \nIn assess ing the margin of safety for environmental HCl exposure, US-EPA calculated  the chronic \nnoncancer health hazard based on a hazard quotient (HQ) , which is the estimated exposure at a \nlocation divided by a reference level (e.g., the RfC). HQs of \u22641 are not li kely to cause adverse \nhealth effects , and as exposures increase above the reference level resulting in HQs >1, the \npotential for adverse effects increases. For assessing acute risks US-EPA performed a screening \nassessment using conservative assumptions combined with reasonable worst -case exposure.  \nThis screening process results in the facility being determined to pose no potential acute health \nrisks (i.e., it \u201cscreens out\u201d), or the facility  requires further assessment. The toxicity reference \nvalues used  for the risk assessment of chronic exposure were based on recommendations for \nHAPS  (USEPA 2018) . The toxicity reference values recommended by HAPs in order of priority are \nUS-EPA RfC\u2019s and CalEPA\u2019s REL  (Table 1). US-EPA\u2019s dose-response assessment for acute \nexposure to HCl was also based on the existing recommendations of HAPs. The res ults from \nscreening acute assessments were compared to C alEPA\u2019s Acute Reference Exposure Levels \n(ARELs), Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) and Emergency Response Planning Guidelines \n(ERPGs)  (Table 1). \nBased on conservative air modeling assumption s and toxicity reference values based on the best \navailable science and methodologies, US-EPA derived a HBEL emission level of 300 tpy of HCl. \nResults of the risk assessment indicated t he maximum chronic non -cancer hazard from HCl \nemissions for this source category resulted in an HQ equal to 0.2, which is 5 times below a HQ of \n1 indicating  adverse chronic health effects are not likely to occur.  For the acute assessment, \nthree facilities had acute screening HQ values equaling or approaching a value of 1. EPA reported \nthat an examination of aerial imagery of the facilities showed  maximum acute off -site HQ equal \nto 0.6.   \nOverall, the air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assu mptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values  used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n12 4.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nHumans are exposed to approximately 4 million tons per year of HCl from natural sources\n(volcanoes, marine life, combustion of vegetation), as well as industrial  sources, HCl is one of the\nmost important basic industrial chemicals IARC (1992) summa rized estimated mean air\nconcentrations of HCl in occupational settings ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 during acid\ntreatment of metals. Mean exposures during other industrial processes are estimated as >1\nmg/m3. HCl is also found in household products  such as cleaners and swimming pool additives\nand is formed during the burning of many plastics.  IARC (1992)  reported that ambient air levels\nof HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3.\nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been\nstudied  with no clear signals of elevated cancer risks emerging.  This is in spite of the high\nlikelihood that individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures\nthat inc luded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Had there been a causal\nassociation between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have been raised\nand any potential association would have been more fully investigated.\nIARC (1992)  recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industri al\nprocesses. In assessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong\ninorganic acids,\u201d IARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational\nexposure to \u201cstrong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric ac id\u201d with cancer. They therefore\nconcluded that occupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is\ncarcinogenic to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992) . In contrast, IARC\u2019s\nconclusion regarding HCl was that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of\nHCl, and they therefore assessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to\nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based\non exposure to mixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are\nfound together  in mixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the\nstrongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, su lfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the\nwhole mixture. This is likely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associ ations observed in\noccupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  All occupational epidemiology studies\npublished since the 1992 IARC determination are consistent with this conclusion.\nAs shown in Table A2 in the Appendix, t he effects of HCl exposure have also been investigated in\nanimal studies. Results  of the only chronic exposure study  indicated increased  incidence of\nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of rats exposed to HCl alone\nas compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed  (Sellakumar\n1985) . Two short term cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD\n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) : Neither  the dermal exposure\nstudy (Narat, 1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment 2002)\nnor the oral exposure study (Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development 2002)  reported any increase in cancer  occurrence .\nSome substances may produce tumors  through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing\nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations.\nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration  below which no\neffects are seen. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed\nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was\nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n13 no evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985)  and there was no evidence of genotoxicity or \ncell proliferation resulting from HCl exposures (reviewed by OECD). Furthermore, in studies \nwhere HCl was administered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm \nHCl neither cause d serious irrit ating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal studies \nindicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm led to increased incidence of hyperplasia, hyperplasia \nwould not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations  below the threshold at \nwhich hyperplasia was reported.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n acceptable \nmargin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce conservative \nair concent rations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce reasonable \nexposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity reference \nvalues used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n5.REFE RENCES\nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelson N, Snyder CA. 1982.

HCl has been known  since the \nMiddle Ages, and was first commercially produced in the early 1800\u2019 s. Because of its many \nindustria l uses,  occupational exposure to HCl is common .  \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and epidemiologic al studies  \nin exposed workers. Several authoritative groups (including the World Health Organization\u2019s \nInternational Agen cy for Research on Cancer [IARC], the International P rogramme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the  international Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n[OECD ]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of the se groups \nhave concluded that HCl is a carcinogen.  Other authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology Program) have chosen not to \nevaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is un likely ba sed on its \nphysical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association \nwith cancer .  \nRamboll US Consulting, Inc. (Ramboll) was asked by the National Lime Association to investigate \nthe potential carcinogenicity of HCl in  order to determine whether it is appropriate for US EPA to \nregulate HCl as a non -carcinogen by using an established health based threshold consistent with \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) . In addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramb oll did \na series of additional literature search es for any new studies which migh t indicate HCl is a \ncarcinogen. We employed several search strategies to make sure we uncovered any new \nscientific evidence that may not have been considered by previous asses sments. Despite  this \nbroad search, we identified  only six additional publications . This newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence . In addition to direct studies of cancer associations, we \nalso examined other supporting evide nce in th e form of genotoxicity studies or potential to \ninduce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the \nevidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often fou nd together in industrial processes . In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201c sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid \u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans ( i.e., a \u201c Group 1 \u201d carcinogen ) (IARC 1992). In contrast , IARC\u2019s conclusio n regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans ( i.e., a \u201c Group \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regardin g acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outc ome (in this case,  surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a car cinogen, either by  authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own \nsearch of the scientific literature , despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore recommends  \nthat based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d),  it would be \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n entire ly appropriate for  EPA to base its  standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, including an \nample margin of safety.  \n \n \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 1 1. INTRODUCTION  \n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (also k nown as an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. Chemists will designate the gas form as \nHCl(g) and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.  \nHCl is used in the production of chlor ides, fertilizers, and dyes, as well as in the textile and \nrubber industries.1 Commercial concentrated hydroc hloric acid  contains 36% to 38% hydrogen \nchloride in water. HCl can also be formed a s a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in \nindustrial manufacturing processes, for example from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime \n(CaO and MgO).   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air.2,3 On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white vapors due to condensation with \natmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into contact with moisture, it forms \nhydrochloric acid. In the early twentieth century, hydrogen chlo ride was created by b urning \nhydrogen gas. This method created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between \nchloride salts and sulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC, 1992).   \n1.2 Residual Risk and Technology Review   \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US  EPA) regulates \nhazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022 In the first  stage, section 112(d)  requires the US EPA to develop technology -based \nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each \ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) .4  \n\u2022 In the second stage, US EPA is required und er section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and \nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If \nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of \nsafety or to prevent an adverse environme ntal effect, US EPA must develop  standards to \naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as \nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US EPA issued MACT  \nstandards, the residual risk stage must be c ompleted within eight years of promulgation \nof the  initial technology -based standard .  \nAlso, under section 112(d)(6), US EPA must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight years and revise it, as necessary, taking into account deve lopments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US EPA will revise the rule. For efficiency, the US EPA  includes the 112(f) \n \n1 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016 -09/documents/hydrochloric -acid.pdf  \n2 https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg173.pdf  \n3 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Hydrochlo ric-acid#section=Solubility  \n4 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 2 and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory pa ckage and calls the rulemakings the Risk and \nTechnology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is based on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on  emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d Alternatively, as outlined in 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 \n7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based threshold, assuming such a \nthreshold has been established. This health -based threshold must include an ample margin of \nsafety. The US EPA will not approve a health -based threshold for  a MACT standard if a HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  As part of the statutory lime manufacturing risk and technology review, EPA \nconducted an inhalation risk assessment for HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and \nfound no unacceptable human health risk unde r worst case emissions scenarios ( 84 FR 48,723 \n(Sep. 16, 2019) ).The EPA risk assessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a \nvariety of human -health risk sc reening benchmarks as part of risk calculations. Ramboll therefore \nhas undertaken this review to confirm the status of HCl as a non -carcinogen, and validate EPA\u2019s \nrisk assessment approach . \nBased on communication with the National Lime Association ( via emai l), the gas temperature at \nthe inlet to the air pollution control device (APCDs) is typically above 400 degrees F for most \nstraight rotary and preheater lime kilns, and roughly 275 degrees for vertical kilns. These \nelevated temperatures are well above the acid dew  point for HCl (typically about 130 degrees F).   \nStack test data obtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing have also confirmed the \npresence of HCl as a gas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are \ncontrolled with dry  APCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions as mist are \nexpected to be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water, i.e., the gas is readily absorbed in \nwater.   \n1.3 Objective of this report  \nThe objective of this report is to review and s ynthesize  the scientific literature regarding the \ncarcinogenicity of HCl.  Ramboll base d this assessment on a combination of previous assessments \nby authoritative bodies, as well as our own literature search.  \n1.4 Previous assessments of HCl carcinogenicity  \nHCl has been evaluated for carcinogenicity by several authoritative agencies or groups, including \nthe World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC), the \nOrganisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ), and the International \nProgramme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). Neither the National Toxicology Program \u2019s (NTP) Report \non Carcinogen ( NTP, 2016 ) nor the US EPA\u2019s Integrative Risk Information System (IRIS) program  \nhave assessed the carcinogenicity of HCl, and neither Agency is currently evaluating the chemical \n(US EPA 2021a5; NTP, 20196). For a common chemical such as HCl, this usually means that the \nrelevant agency does not consider the evidence compelling enough to undertake a major review \n \n5 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021 -03/doc uments/iris_program_outlook_mar2021.pdf  \n6 https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/ongoing/index.html  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 3 effort  (US EPA , 2021b7; NTP, 2016a8; NTP 2016b ).  \nThe stated purpose of IARC reviews, published in monographs, is to identify cancer hazards , i.e., \nagents that are capable of causing cancer. IARC is explicit that hazard s are separate from actual \nrisks, with the latter depend ing on factors including exposure duration  and concentration. \nSubstances are raised for review by IARC every five years by an Advisory Group  that makes its \nrecommendations from nominations submitted by scienti sts and regulatory agencies . The \nselection is based on the ava ilability of data and current public health priorities, as well as the \nexistence of signals that the substance may pose a cancer hazard9. IARC convened a working \ngroup of experts  to evaluate HCl i n October 1991 and published their findings in a monograph \n(IARC 1992) . Based on their evaluation of the occupational cohort and case -control studies and \ntoxicological data  available in 199 1 (see section 2.1 for discussion of these studies) , IARC  \nconcluded  that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in humans and that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in animals. Based on these findings, \nIARC concluded that HCl is not classifiable  as to it s carcinogenicity in  humans (Group 3).  This \ncategory is used for agents, mixture s, and exposure circumstances which IARC has evaluated \nand found that \u201c the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or \nlimited in experimental animals. \u201d If IARC finds evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity , \u201c\u2026the \nWorking Grou p may add a sentence to the evaluation to characterize the agent as well -studied \nand without evidence of carcinogenicity.\u201d The other classifications used by IARC are  carcinogenic \nto humans  (Group 1); probably carcinogenic to humans  (Group 2A) and possibly carcinogenic to \nhumans (Group 2B)9. In its history, IARC classified only one chemical as probably not \ncarcinogenic  to humans (Group 4) , and the Agency eliminated this category in 2019 ; more tha n \nhalf of the 1,090 chemicals it has reviewed have been classif ied as Group 3 .10 11 \nIARC also reviewed other inorganic acids in the same monograph , including \u201csulfuric acid  and \nother strong inorganic acids\u201d  (IARC  1992) . In contrast to their conclusion for HCl, t heir conclusion \nfor sulfuric acid and other strong inorgani c acids  was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence  that \noccupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d \nIARC\u2019s overall evaluation was that \u201cOccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists \ncontaining sulfuric  acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) \u201d (IARC 1992).  This is relevant \nbecause the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that must include sulfur ic acid. While \nsulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid exposures , the exposure c ontained in \nthe mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive \nthe relationship for the whole mixture. Thi s is likely the explanation for the sporadic effects \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  \nThe Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ) Screening Information \nDataset  (SIDS) Initial Assessment Profile (2002) evaluated the scientific literature concerning \nevidence for the carcinogenicity of HCl an d concluded th at \u201cIn humans, no association between \nhydrogen chloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d Their assessment is based on \nstudies finding no association between HCl exposure and cancer  (Albert et al., 1982; Farrow et \nal., 1989; Bond et al. , 1986; Bo nd et al. , 1991; Bond et al. , 1993; Bond et al. , 1995) .

They further stated that, on the basis of the limited information available from \nindustrial survey data, and from the observations of controlled exposure studies, it is mo st \nunlikely that the general population is exposed routinely to any significant health risks from HCl.  \n2. SEARCH METHODS   \n2.1 Identifying Relevant Literature  \nIn their Monograph Volume 54, published in 1992, IARC identified a total of 8 relevant \nepidemiological studies , including 3 cohort studies ( Collins et al. 1989 ; Beaumont et al. 1967 ; \nSteenland et al 1988) and 5 case-control studies (Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond et \nal., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; and Siemiatyc ki, 1991). IARC also identified a single experimental \nanimal cancer study (Sellakumar et al., 1 985), which examined rats exposed by inhalation to \nHCl.  \nIn their SIDS document, OECD (2002) identified many of the same studies identified by IARC \n(1992), as well as one additional epidemiological study ( Farrow et al, 1989) and one \nexperimental animal study (Albert et al., 1982). They also discussed two exp erimental animal \nstudies ( a dermal exposure study, Narat, 1925; and an oral administration study, Dyer et al., \n1946) which they judged, due to study design limitations, were not appropriate for assessing \ncarcinogenic potential.  \nAfter starting with the lite rature identified by the authoritative reviews ( ICPS, 1082; IARC, 1992; \nOECD , 2002 ), we developed a literature search strategy consisting of three different approaches : \n(1) Reviewing papers published since IARC considered the carcinogenicity of HCl in 1991  that \ncited the relevant epidemiolog ical studies cited in the IARC monograph vol. 54;  (2) a search  of \nepidemiological studies addressing possible associations between exposure to HCl and cancer ; \nand (3) a targeted search of chronic (long-term) bioassays fo r cancer associated with HCl \nexposure  in experimental animals . Because HCl is a common laboratory ingredient used in many \nexperimental set -ups, a broad er literature search for animal studies or in vitro  studies would \nhave resulted in an overwhelming number  of irrelevant papers. We therefore conducted a very \ntargeted search  for additional animal studies . \nBoth t he search of epidemiological studies examining cancer as a health endpoint and the \ntargeted search of chronic bioassay studies for cancer in animals u sed PubMed, a database \ndeveloped by the National Library of Medicine that includes  more than 32 million citations for \nbiomedical literature from journal articles in life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine , \nand online books . \n2.1.1  Papers That Cited Epidemiological Papers  Included in IARC or OECD  \nUsually, authors of journal articles cite previous relevant research in their manuscripts . Ramboll \ntherefore conducted a search of scientific papers that cited the literature identified by IARC \n(1992)  or OECD ( 2002).  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 5 Using the database Google Scholar , Ramboll conducted a search for any papers that cite one or \nmore of the 9 studies identified by IARC (Sellakumar et al., 1985; Collins et al. , 1989; Beaumont \net al., 1967; Steenland et al ., 1988; Bond et al., 1983; B ond et al., 1985; Bond et al., 1986; and \nSiemiatyc ki, 1991)  or the additional epidemiological studies identified  by OECD ( Farrow  et al., \n1989). We did not perform citation searches on the experimental animal studies discussed by \nOECD (2002) because the Albert et al . (1982) bioassay study was superseded by the subsequent \npublication by  the same group  (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ), and because the two other cancer \nstudies in experimental animals (Dyer et al., 1946; Naret, 1925) were judged by OECD (2002) as \nhavin g major faults in their study design precluding conclus ions to be drawn from their results.  \n2.1.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature   \nA literature search was conducted using PubMed , based  on using  combinations of the following \nsearch terms: \u201coccupationa l\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chy drogen \nchloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -\ncontrol\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d, clinical studies were filtered out of the search so as to \nremove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s.  \n2.1.3  Targeted Pu bMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nA targeted literature search was conducted using PubMed, based  on using combinations of the \nfollowing search terms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201c chronic bioassay\u201d; and \n\u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d .  \n2.1.4  Exclusion criteria  \nPublications  were excluded at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed \nin the study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the te st material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxicity study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3. RESULTS   \n3.1 Literature Search  Findings   \nThe results  from different steps  of this search process are  outlined in Figure 1 (PRISMA diagram).  \nA total of eight epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., \n1985; Bond et al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Collins et al. 1989; Siemia tycki, 1991; Steenland et \nal., 1988 ) and one cancer study in experimental animals (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ) were included \nin the IARC (2002)  report.  A total of six epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et \nal., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond e t al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Farrow et al. 1989) and four \ncancer studies in experimental animals (Albert et al., 1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 1925; \nSellakumar et al., 1985 ) were cited in OECD (2002)12. Note, there was some overlap between  \nthese two sets of studies. Together,  a total of 13 unique  studies were identified \u2013 nine \n \n12 Note, one further publication cited by OECD ( ANON, ed. 1987 . Pestic. Toxic. Chem. News., 15(43), 6. ) was reported only in summary  form and \nneither the publication nor the abstract could be found. It was not included in the counts. OECD reported that all respiratory cancer cases in this \nstudy were smokers; therefore, confounding cannot be ruled out.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 6 epidemiological and four in animal s (see Appendix A) .  \nConducting a search of scientific publications that cite the se IARC-cited or OECD -cited studies \nresulted in a total of 1,008  publications to screen .13 We screened the tit les and abstracts of these \npublications, and identified five additional papers ( Coggon et al. 1996; Hathaway et al. 1997; \nSoskolne et al. 2011 ; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nThe PubMed search es for epidemiological publications  resulted in a total of 1,934  scientific \npublications ; after removal of duplicates  and publications that had been identified through \nauthoritative searches or citation searches , 771 unique publications  remained. The targeted \nPubMed search of the animal toxicological literature resulted in 56 publications ; after removal of \nduplicates  and publications that had been identified through authoritative searches or citation \nsearches , 34 unique publications remained.  Overall, 805 unique p ublications were identified  \nthrough both PubMed search  strategies . We screened the titles and abstracts of these unique \npublications to identify 24 publications  which warranted a f ull text screen for relevance . Only one \nadditional relevant publication was identified from this full text screen (Tsai et al. 2016 ).  \nA total o f 19 relevant articles were identified through the combined literature search strateg y, \nconsisting of  the initial nine epidemiological stud ies identified by IARC a nd OECD and four \ntoxicol ogy study identified by IARC and OECD , and the six additional  articles (five epidemiological \nstudies  identified through the  citation search of the initial articles, and one additional article \nresulting from the very broad PubMed search es) (Figure 1 ).  \n3.2 Summary of Findings  \nThe 19 relevant publications  identified  through this extensive literature search included:  13 \nepidemiological  studies containing  statistical  analys es of the association between exposure to HCl \nand cancer ; four publicati ons examining  cancer in experimental animals;  one commentary/letter \nto the editor , and one review . Below is a discussion of three cohort studies ( Collins et al ., 1989; \nBeaumont et al ., 1987; Steenland et al ., 1988), ten case-control studies  (Bond et al ., 1983; \nBond et al ., 1985; Bond et al ., 1986; Bond et al. , 1991; Siemiatycki , 1991; Fritschi and \nSiemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b; Farrow et al. 1989; Coggon et al. , 1996; \nSosklone et al. , 2011), and four animal toxicity stud ies (Sellakumar e t al., 1985; Albert et al., \n1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 192 5). See Appendix A for list of all relevant publications.  A \ndetailed  summary of the epidemiological studies, including information on study characteristics, \nstatistical analyses, and limitation s, is included in Appendix B.  \n \n \n13 Among the experimental animal s tudies, only the Sellakumar et al. 1985 st udy was the subject of our search because the Albert et al., 1982 \npublication was superseded by the subsequent Sellakumar et al., 1985 publication, and the other two experimental animal cance r studies were \nvery old  and inadequate . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 7  \n3.3 Discussion of Individual Publicat ions \nWe discuss individual studies of the carcinogenicity of HCl and HCl mists below. Further details of \nthese studies can be found in Appendix B. \n \n\nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 8 3.3.1  Epidemiolog ical Studies   \nIn a cohort study  of steel workers involved in pickling operations, Beaumont et al.  (1987) \nexamined lung cancer mortality patterns in 1,165 workers exposed to sulfuric acid mist and other \nacid mists (primarily HCl mist) . Jobs were categorized by acid use (sulfuric acid or other acid)  \nand exposure potential  (i.e., the likelihood of daily exposure) in order to define the following  \nexposure categor ies: (1) any acid exposure  (the entire exposed cohort) ; (2) sulfuric acid \nexposure only ; (3) sulfuric acid only with probable daily  exposure  (a subset of Group 3) ; (4) \nother  (not sulfuric) acid exposure only ; and (5) exposure to both sulfuric acid and other acids . \nThe analyses included those who were employed for at least 6 months in a pickling -related job  \nwith at least 1 day of work prior to 1965. Compared with men in the general U.S. population , the \n189 workers with exposure to other acids ( not sulfuric acid ) had a statistically significant \nincreased lung cancer mortality rate (SMR 2.24, 95% CI 1 .02, 4. 26) based on  9 observed deaths.  \nWhen they used a more appropriate comparison to US steel workers, however, the risk estimate \nwas lower  (SMR 2.0 , 95% CI 1.06, 3.78).  No data on other occupational exposures or smoking \nhabits  were included in the study , and confounding by smoking status, e specially, cannot be \nruled out . The authors attempted several indirect adjustments for smoking, with mixed results . \nThe authors discussed  several additional limitations of the study  and suggested that chance \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation  for the re sults.  \nSteenland et al.  (1988) conducted a  reanalysis of 879 members of the Beaumont et al. (1987) \nsteelworker cohort who had  information related to presence or absence of diagnosis of laryngeal  \ncancer (Steenland et al. , 1988). US referent rates , calculate d using national surveys of cancer \nincidence , were used for comparison . Most workers in the analysis were exposed to sulfuric acid , \neither with or without other acids . Two of the laryngeal cancer  cases were exposed to acids other \nthan sulfuric ac id and thr ee were exposed to a mixture of acids ; these numbers are too small to \ngenerate reliable statistical estimates of association . The authors  reported an increased risk of \nlaryngeal cancer in steel pickler workers compared to US referent rates (RR 2. 6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.0  \n(as reported by IARC 1992 ), however this includes all 9 cases a cross all exposure groups ( sulfuric \nacid, other acids only, and mixture of acids).  In its evaluation, t he IARC (1992) working group \nnoted that confounding by sulfuric acid co uld not be  ruled out . The authors compared the \nsmoking habits of their incident cancer  cohort obtained from next of kin interviews  with the \nsmoking habits of the US population in 1965. They found that in their cohort \u201cthere was a similar \noverall prevalence of smokin g compared with all United States men but cohort members who did \nsmoke smoked more than the United States average.\u201d The a uthors also used methods similar to \nthose described by Beaumont et al. (1987) to  indirectly adjust for smoking habi ts, but residual \nconfounding by smoking, in addition to exposure to sulfuric acid in the mixed exposure group, \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation for the results . \nMortality patterns were examined in a follow -up study of 8,854 workers from four Cyanimid \nplants in the United  States and the Netherlands , where 2,293 of the workers were believed to \nhave been exposed to the chemical acrylamide  (Collins et al., 1989) . Each plant had mortality \npatterns similar to other worker populations , and no excess mortality  across all plants was \nobserved for any of the 26 cancer sites examined . However, a n excess in lung cancer (SMR 1.3 2) \nwas observed in one of the four facilities  studied ( the Warners  facility ). In this facility,  11 of the \n63 lung cancer deaths were in a department where there was exposure to HCl (data not \npresented in paper) . This paper was discussed by the IARC working group (1992), who noted \nthat no information for the expected numbers of cases in that facility was provided, making it \ndifficult to interpret that observation . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 9 A case-control study of brain cancer mortality at a Dow Chemical plant in Texas included an \nevaluat ion of the potential association between brain cancer  and occupational exposure to  HCl \n(Bond et al., 1983) . A total of 28 former workers were identified who had died from brain cancer ; \n13 of these had evidence of HCl exposure  based on a review of job titles . The study  incorporated \ndata from  two control groups  selected from the plant : Group A selected from 110 white male \ndeaths without cancer (42 with evidence of HCl exposure based on job title) and Group B \nselected from a random sample of 111 employees  without regard to vital status or cancer status  \n(51 with evidence of HCl exposure) . There was no statistically significant association observed \nbetween any expos ure to HCl and brain tumors among workers when compared to either control \ngroup (Odds ratio ( OR) 1.40, 90% CI 0.70, 2.80 ; OR 1.02, 90% CI 0.81, 1.29 ). Sub-analyses \nbased on duration of employment focused on those who were employed for 1 -4 years, as there  \nwere only four cases with 20 or more years  of employment . There  was no evidence of  an \nincrease in risk of brain cancer associated with HCl exposure  in this subgroup (cases: n = 5, \ncontrols: n = 15; OR 2.02 , 90% CI 0.5, 8.1) . Note that these authors reported  90% confidence \nintervals, rather than the usual 95% confidence intervals , which increases the likelihood of \ndetecting an association. This choice is usually made w hen the focus is on screening for potential \nassociations  and generating hypotheses to be tes ted in future, more rigorous studies.  \nSubsequent ly, Bond et al. (1985) published a case-control study of renal cancer mortality and \nexposure to HCl based  in the sam e Dow Chemical plant , using the same study population and \ncontrol groups  examined earlier (B ond et al., 1983). The authors  did not observe an increased \nrisk of  renal cancer in workers exposed to HCl (26 deaths from renal cancer; 12 with evidence of \nexposure to HCl based on job title) as compared to either control group (OR  0.90, 90% CI 0.44, \n1.83 based on 44 exposed out of 92 controls ; OR 0.86, 90% CI 0.40, 1.86  based on 50 exposed \nout of 98 controls ). Cases and controls were matched on age, race, and sex, but potential  \nconfounding  by exposure to other occupational chemicals  was not controlled . The authors did not \nobserve substantial differences in smoking habits  between groups and therefore reported that \nsmoking was unlikely to have been a confounder.  \nIn a third case-control study  based in the same Dow Chemical plant, Bond et al. (1986) analyzed \nthe risk of lung cancer associated with  hydrogen chloride  exposure based on job title . There were \n308 lung cancer deaths compared with t wo control groups chose n from the plant : a decedent \ncontrol group and a living control group. Each contained 308 men individually matched to cases \non race, year of birth + 5 years, and year of hire. Separate  results of cases with each control \ngroup were similar, so t he authors pooled the control groups for greater statistical power.  The \nauthors did not observe an association  between  HCl exposure and lung cancer overall  (exposed \ncases: n = 129, exposed  control s: n = 245,  OR 1.02, 95% CI 0. 77, 1.35) or with a 15 year \nlatency period ( exposed cases: n = 108, exposed controls: n = 218, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68, \n1.24).  The authors  collected information on  potential confounders and noted the following  to be \nstatistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk , as expected : cigarette smoking, vitamin \nA intake, use of vitamin supplements, and education level . These findings lend su pport to the \nvalidity of the main analyses.  However, due to small number of subjects available for analysis , \nthe authors appropriately chose  not to control for these potential confounders . \nThe Dow chemical worker  population was re -evaluated again,  using exposure estimates derived \nfrom job assignments, duration of exposure , and cumulative exposure  (Bond et al. , 1991). \nAnalyses to estimate the risk of mortality from lung, trachea, and bronchial  cancer  (combined) \nwere performed without and with a 16-year latency period and controlling for pack-years  of \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 10 smoking . There was no  relationship between HCl exposure and lung cancer in any of the HCl \nexposure groups  (see Appendix B) . \nCoggon et al. (1996) investigated the risk of upper aerodigestive cancer mortality from exposure \nto mineral acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) in a study of steel and battery manufacture workers \n(Coggon et al., 1996). The authors categorized exposure as (1) no exposure to any acid mists; \n(2) low exposure to acid mists (<1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid or HCl); and high exposure to acid mists \n(>1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid o r HCl). Based on just 15 cases , the authors  reported no convincing \nassociation between exposure to mixed acid mists and upper aerodigestive cancer mortality in \nany category of exposure conce ntration and duration (see appendix B). The study also evaluated \nthe association of \u201cdefinite\u201d exposure to mixed acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) and \u201call cancer\u201d \nmortality compared to that in the national population and found no evidence of an increase in \ncancer mortality  among the workers (full cohort SMR 0.88, 95% C I 0.79, 0.98; never exposed \nSMR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.91; definitely exposed SMR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79, 1.05 ).  \n \nSoskolne at al. (2011) examined the association between lung cancer and occupation al exposure \nto specific acids (HCl, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, ac etic acid, hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, \nhydrocyanic acid, sulfuric dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen)  in a population -based study  of 178 \ncases and 167 controls in Toronto, Canada . Proxy  interviews provided estimates of exposure \nconcentration and frequency of exposure  based on work history,  which the authors used to \ncalculate an exposure index that factored in the duration of exposure in months. There was no \nincrease in risk of lung cance r for those \u201cever\u201d exposed vs. unexposed  to HCl (OR  0.98, 95% CI \n0.71, 1.35) or for those with low estimated  exposure vs. unexposed (OR  0.80, 95% CI 0.53, \n1.22). The high exposure group  had a non -statistically significant increase in risk, based on 83 \ncases (OR  1.24, 95% CI 0.79, 1.96) (see appendix B). The authors considered all  cancers of the \nlip, mouth, retromolar area, nasopharynx, larynx, and nasal sinus as lung cancer for analysis.  \n \nIn another population -based case -control study, this time in Montrea l, Canada, Siemiatiycki \n(1991) examined t he association s between HCl exposure and 11 differen t cancers ( esophagus, \nstomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, kidney, skin melanoma, and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma) . The target population w as men aged 35 to 70  years who were living  in the \nMontreal metropolitan area. Cases had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the selected \ncancer sites  with the date of initial diagnosis between September 1979 and June 1985 . A total of \n4,576 eligible cas es were ascertained. Data were analyzed using cancer controls , i.e., all cancer \ncases with cancers of sites other than the site being analyzed, and popul ation controls . \nPopulation controls had no  cancer diagnoses  and comprised  an age -stratified random samp le \ndrawn from a list of  all adult Canadian citizens resident in the province that were eligible to vote . \nDetailed job -history interviews were conducted a mongst all cancer cases to classify exposure. \nThe a uthors reported that p opulation controls were interv iewed in a manner as similar as possible \nto the cancer cases.   \nExposure to specific substances and concentration and frequency of exposure  were estimated  \nbased on job categories . Based on this coding, the authors  analyzed the relationships between  \n\u201cany exp osure\u201d and \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d (a subset of \u201cany exposure\u201d) to HCl and each of the \n11 cancer sites , with confounding assessed separately  for each cancer site . Potential confounders \nincluded  age, family income, ethnic origin, birthplace , smoking, alcohol  intake, coffee \nconsumption,  body mass index , and self - or proxy -respondent . After adjustment , there was no  \nstatistically significant assoc iation between 10 of the 11 cancers and exposure to HCl (see \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 11 Appendix B) . The risk of non -Hodgkins lymphoma was highe r among those with any exposure to \nHCl vs. no exposure : OR=1.5  (90% CI 1.0, 2.2 ) based on 90% confidence intervals, which are \nused in hypot hesis-generating analyses because they are more likely to detect associations than \nthe standard  95% confidence  interv al.  \nThe a uthors also evaluated the association between HCl exposure and certain cancer sites in \nsubsets of the population : (1) all ethnic groups, cancer controls ; (2) all ethnic groups, population \ncontrols; (3) French -Canadians only, cancer controls; and (4) French -Canadians only, population \ncontrols . Analyses  within each group were conducted for any and substantial exposure to HCl . \nFrom these eight sets of analyses, the authors reported  results for three cancer sites : rectum, \nlung-oat cell, and non -Hodgki n\u2019s lymphoma (see appendix B). There was borderline  statistically \nsignificant  elevated risk for non -Hodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma in the French -Canadian cancer control s \nsubset (n = 18, OR 1.6 , 90% CI 1.0, 2.5) and  lung-oat cell cancer in the all ethnic groups cancer \ncontrol subset (n = 19, OR 1.6, 9 0% CI 1.0, 2.6)  from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl . When limited to \nthose with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl, results for lung -oat cell cancer remained borderline \nstatistically significant (n=8, OR 2.1, 90% CI 1.0, 4.5) and results  for non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \nwere not statistically significant ( n = 6, OR 1.5 , 95% CI 0.7, 3.2).  The a uthors reported a \nstatistically  significantly elevated risk of rectum cancer from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl (n = 18, OR \n1.9, 90% CI 1.1, 3.4) in the French Ca nadian population subset, but this association was smaller \nand not statistica lly significant  when limited to those with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl (rectum: \nn = 5, OR 1.5, 90% CI 0.5, 3.8). The very small number of cases and wide 90% confidence \nintervals  around these estimates do not supply convincing evidence of an association b etween \nHCl exposure and risk of rectal cancer.  \nFritschi and Siemiatycki (1996a ) conducted additional analyses on the association of 11 \nsubstances and non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma , adju sting for age, proxy status, income, and ethnicity . \nExposure was categorized as \u201csubstantial\u201d , defined as having probable or definite exposure and \nmore than 5 years of exposure at high frequency concentration , or \u201cnon-substantial\u201d exposure. \nThere was no  statistically significant association between occupational HCl exposure and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma  at either exposure level ( substantial exposure  n=6, OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5, \n3.4; non -substantial exposure  n=16,  OR 1.6 , 95% CI 0.9, 3.0). Fritschi and Siemiatycki (1996b) \nfurther evaluated exposure to several chemicals and melan oma. Risk results for HCl and \nmelanoma were not provided, because it was \u201cnot associated with melanoma in any multivariate \nanalyses\u201d (Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nIn a pilot study precedi ng the full study  by Siemiatycki et al , (1991 ), Farrow et al. (19 89) \ninterviewed 39 male and 24 female preleukemia patients diagnosed from September 30, 1985 to \nSeptember 30 , 1986 for lifetime occupational  exposure to specific chemicals , one of which was \nHCl. When compared with controls from a n outpatient ear, nose  and throat (ENT) surgical clinic \nmatched to cases on age and sex, there was no meaningful difference between  cases and \ncontrols (cases: n = 5, mean exposure = 21,000 h ours; controls: n = 4, mean exposure = 5,000 \nhours). The authors did not report odds rat ios for these findings , which would have been \napproximately 1 .0 based on the nearly identical numbers of cases and controls .  \n  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 12 3.3.2  Cancer Studies in Experimental Animals  \nThe carcinogenicity of HCl wa s examined in two chronic cancer stud ies in rats as part of studies \ndesigned to explore the combined impacts of inhaled HCl and another irritating gas, \nformaldehyde  (Albert et al., 1982; Sellakumar et al., 1985) . This combination of gases is found in \nthe degradation of a carcinogen, bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME). Since formaldehyde is both an \nirritating gas and a  carcinogen in animal inhalation studies (Swenberg et al., 1980) , and HCl is \nalso an irritating gas, the  studies reported in these two publications  (Albert et al., 1982; \nSellakumar et al., 1985) tested whether inhalation of the combination of formaldehyde and HCl \nwere more carcinogenic than inhalation of formaldehyde alone . Part of the controls in these test s \nwere groups of animals exposed only to fo rmaldehyde, or only to HCl, allowing an assessment of \nthe carcinogenicity of HCl.  \nIn the ear lier study  (Albert et al., 1982) , a group of 99 eight-week old male Sprague -Dawley  rats \nwere exposed by inhalation to a mixture of 10 ppm HCl and 14 ppm formaldehyd e for 6 hours \nper day , 5 days per week, for their lifetime. Control groups (50 rats per group) were exposed to \neither air introduced to the cages in the same manner as the exposed group  (the \"sham\u201d \ncontrol) , or simply held in exposure chambers without any exposure. Authors reported benign  \nsquamous meta plasia, and two types of nasal cancer \u2014 squamous  papillo ma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma \u2014 in rats expose d to the mixture of HCl and formaldehyde ; these lesions were not \nfound in the control group . This result i s consistent with precious ly published  results obtained \nwhen rats were exposed  to formaldehyde alone ( Swenberg et al., 1980 ), and are consistent of \nthe cancer resulting from exposure to formaldehyde . \nA second experiment exposed groups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats to either inhaled \nHCl, formaldehyde, combinations of HCl and formaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 \nhours per day, 5 d ays per week . This publication (Albert et al., 1982) reports interim results after \n84 weeks ; full results  are reported in the Sellakumar et al. (1985) publication , below.  \nGroups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats were exposed  by inhalation  to either  HCl[g], \nformaldehyde, two types of combinations of HCl[g] and formaldehyde, or a control group of air \nalone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week  over 122 week s (Sellakumar et al., 1985) . Results \nwere also compared to unexposed control animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm ( 14.9 \nmg/m3) in the HCl -only exposure as well as the HCl plus formaldehyde exposure gr oup. Following \nsacrifice, animals were examined for tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special attention \nto the re spiratory tract (th e site of formaldehyde -induced tumors).  While hyperplasia (indicative \nof cell proliferation)  was evident in the l arynx and trachea of animals  exposed to HCl alone as \ncompared to air controls or colony controls , no excess cancer was observed.  In the groups \nexposed to both HCl and formaldehyde, the cancer response was attributed to formaldehyde . \nTwo other cancer studie s in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (2002) \u2013 a dermal \nexposure study  (Narat, 1925) and an oral exposure study ( Dyer et al., 1946 ). The dermal study \nincluded 99 mice were dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions containing 3 -5% HCl  \nevery 1-2 days until skin lesions were observed and then weekly for 4-6 additional weeks (total \nexposure duration 25-46 weeks) (Narat, 1925). No malignant tumor s were reported, and OECD \nconcluded that the study  is not appropriate for the assessment of carcino genicity  because the of \nshortcomings in the study design  (lack of negative control, brief exposure period).  The oral study \nDyer et al., 1946) included was a study designed to examine whether acids present in the \nstomach, such as HCl, would modify the carci nogenicity of 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene . In this \nstudy, groups of  mice (4 different strains) were exposed to a combination of HCl (1-2.5 moles \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 13 per liter)  and either a \u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene (40 \nmice) through a tube inserted into their stomachs (Dyer et al., 1946). Other exposure groups \nwithout HCl were also included in th e study. No excess  cancer or pre -cancerous lesions were \nobserved  in the stomachs of animals from either group  exposed to HCl . However, OECD \nconclude d the study is not appropriate for the assessment of carcinogenicity because of the \nshortcomings of the stud y design (inconsistent strain , short exposure duration , single exposure \nconcentration ).  \n3.3.3  Reviews and Commentar ies Identified  \nHathaway (1997) provide d a commentary that was critical of the methodological quality of \nstudies reviewed by IARC (1992). Among other concerns, Hathaway noted small numbers of \ncases leading to imprecise estimates, shown by wide confidence intervals, and likely \nmisclassifi cation when exposure to HCl was part of a mixed exposure category. Misattribution of \nrisks associated with exposure to some other substance that was part of the mixture could have \nresulted in some of the elevated point estimates reported by the authors if that ot her substance \nwas carcinogenic and HCl is not. Hathaway  also noted inconsistencies in reporting the number of \nexposed and unexposed cases in at least one study , which would affect the results given the \nsmall number of exposed cases available for ana lysis. \nTsai et al. (2016) conducted a review of the regulatory systems and human health effects \ndesignated by the Taiwan government under the Air Pollution Control Act. The study reviewed \ncarcinogenic and non -carcinogenic health risks for designated air to xics. T he study compiled data \nfrom international agencies such as IARC, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the American Conference of Governmental \nIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH)  and based on this d ata cat egorized HCl as non -carcinogenic.  \n4. DISCUSSION   \n4.1 Conclusions  of Authoritative  Reviews  \nThe consensus  opinion of multiple authoritative bodies is that HCl is unlikely to be a carcinogen. \nIARC classified HCl in Group 3 (not classifiable), which is the cla ssifica tion group used when  the \nchemical is considered least likely to present a cancer  hazard . Note that IARC has only classified \na single chemical as \u201cprobably not carcinogenic to humans \u201d (Group 4), and they no longer \nconsider this category. OECD went further, stating \u201cIn humans, no association between hydrogen \nchloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d IARC also reviewed other inorganic acids \nin the same monograph, including \u201csu lfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids\u201d (IARC 1992). \nIn contrast to their conclusion for HCl, their conclusion for sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic \nacids was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence that occupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid \nmists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d IARC\u2019s overall evaluat ion was that \u201cOccupational \nexposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group \n1)\u201d (IARC 1992). This is relevant because the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that \nmust include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid \nexposures, the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome \n(in this case, surfuric a cid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This likely the \nexplanation for the sporadic effects observed in occupational studies of mixed acids containing \nHCl. \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 14 ICPS did a broader assessment of potential toxicity to the general population and c oncluded that \nother than during accidental releases, it is most unlikely t hat the general population is exposed \nroutinely to any significant health risks from HCl. Furthermore, neither US EPA nor the NTP have \nidentified HCl as a chemical worthy of assessin g for carcinogenicity. Thus, although HCl is a \nwidely used chemical, no au thoritative body has concluded that it poses a cancer risk.  An \nextensive search of the primary published scientific literature identified a total of 4 publications \nnot considered by the authoritative bodies  discussed above. One of these publications is a r eview \nand one is a commentary; two publications are epidemiolocal studies. Neither alter s the \nconclusions of the prior assessments.  \n4.2 Supporting Evidence  \n4.2.1  Evidence Regarding Genotoxicity   \nMutation or genetic changes are often viewed as a first step in carcin ogenicity , so various assays  \nexamining such changes, as well as assays designed to predict such changes (collectively \nreferred to as genotoxicity assays)  are often used to predict cancer  potential . HCl did not induce \nmutations in six bacterial mutation ass ays or one mutation assay  in yeast cells  (reviewed by \nIARC, 1992; OECD, 2002). A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell survival in strains \nthat have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two assays but OECD \nconcluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by OECD, 2002) . A \nweakly p ositive response for mutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay ; these \nresults are interpreted as being an artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell cu lture \nmedium), which itself related to cell death . Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cultures \nwere negative (reviewed by IARC, 1992; OECD, 2002) . HCl induced chromo some aberrations in \nmammalian cells in culture  when concentrations were in excess of 1 0 mM in the cell culture \nmedia  (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8)  and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse l ymphoma cells, and  in insect and plant  cells in a very limited set of \nstudies ; both  IARC (1992) and OECD ( 2002)  found that the acidic pH  is the responsible  factor for \nthese responses and that  similar responses are observed for other inorganic acids and with acetic \nacid. These concentrations would not be found environmentally14 and are thus not relevant for \nambient air exposures to HCl.  \n4.2.2  Evidence for Inducing Cell Proliferation   \nIn addition to mutagenic  carcinogens, there are some carcinogens that are believed to act \nthrough a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing extensive cell turnover which leads to the \npossibility of replication errors leading to mutations. However, such mechanisms are believed t o \nhave a threshold concentration below which no effects are seen. In the case of HCl, there is \nfurther evidence from the co -exposure study of Sellakumar et al. (198 5), where exposure to 10 \nppm HCl did not cause serious irritating effects and did not enhanc e the carcinogenicity of \nformaldehyde. Thus, there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic ca rcinogens.  \n \n14 10 mM corresponds to ~355 ppm in solution or 355 mg/Liter. In comparison, HCl concentrations in the ambient air usually do no t exceed 0.01 \nmg/m3 (IARC, 1992). Conservative m odelling data  (unpublished Ramboll report to National Lime Assoc iation, 2019), pre dicts that the maximum \nconcentration of HCl in the air at the fenceline kiln would be 0.0012 mg/m3.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 15 4.3 Limita tions of the Existing Literature ( for client discussion only )  \nThe epidemio logical studies evaluated by IARC and OECD  were methodologically limited . \nLimitations included lack of exposure verification or measurement; inadequate control for \nconfounding exposures associated with certain cancers, small sample size  or small numbers of  \ncases, leading to lack of statistical power . In addition, many of the studies evaluated mixed \nexposures and mixed outcomes. The use of mixed exposure groups is par ticularly germane, as \nthe mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic a cid mists , which are \nclassified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl and these other acids, the apparent \nassociation between HCl and cancer  will be inflated due to the effect of the other acids .  \nIn spite of these weaknesses, the overall conclusi on by IARC based on their review of the \nepidemiological data is supported by the small number of cases of cancers observed in various \noccupational cohorts as well a s by the toxicological evidence that HCl does not have carcinogenic \nproperties.  \n5. CONCLUSIONS   \nHCl has been assessed for carcinogenic potential by multiple authoritative  bodies . After a \nthorough  search for new studies  post-dating those assessments , Ramboll c oncluded that the \nscientific evidence does not suggest  it poses carcinogenic  risks. In addi tion to direct studies of \ncancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity \nstudies or potential to induce cell proliferati on. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evide nce for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogen ic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinoge nicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies  of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use .  Ramboll therefore \nrecommends that based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d), it \nwould be entirely appropriate for EPA to base its standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, \nincluding an ample margin of safety.  \nReferences  \nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelso n N, Snyder CA. 1982.

Trinity was asked to review the model \nsetup, modeling procedures and input data to verify that EPA\u2019s approach was reasonable and consistent with the data provided to EPA by the industry.   Below is a summary of our review.  \n Trinity first reviewed the modeling input parameters used by EPA.\n3 This review focused on the facilities that \nEPA had determined were the \u201cworst -case\u201d  and therefore were the basis of supporting the proposed  HBEL.  \nThe three facilities that EPA concluded were the worst -case contributors to ambient HCl were:  1) Cemex \nPonce,  PR; 2)  Carmeuse River Rouge,  MI; and 3)  Carmeuse Maysville , KY. The stack parameters for the two \nCarmeuse plants were compared to NLA\u2019s records as well as prior EPA modeling for this rulemaking. The \nstack parameters were Cemex were only compared to prior EPA modeling. Overall , the stack parameters \nwere consistent with avail able data, even though we did identify minor differences in exhaust temperature \n(<0.01% deviation from available data ).  Additionally, Trinity reviewed the air dispersion modeling \nprocedure (i.e., the modeling techniques and procedures applied)  for developing the HBEL .  We did not find \nany material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the analysis  is consistent with prior methods for \nanalyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \n \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has  proposed an HBEL for HCl  providing conservative  estimates of \nconcentrations in ambient air , the analysis relies on input data from the industry  for the \u201cworst case\u201d \nsources and applied the air dispersion in a manner consistent with accepted practice.  Therefore , we believe  \nthe predicted modeling impacts suppor t EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c 300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime \nManufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in \nthe source category\u201d.4 \n \n \n1  89 FR  28, page 9092.  \n2 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n3 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0184.  \n4 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n \n \n \nMarch 1, 2023 \n \n \nJonathan De\u2019Ath \nNational Lime Association \n200 North Glebe Rd. Ste 800 \nArlington, VA 22203 \n \n \nRE: Proposed Lime MACT Detection Limit Review \n   \n \nDear Mr. De\u2019Ath,  \n \nAlliance Technical Group, LLC (Alliance) has reviewed the series eleven (11) of reports that were provided to \ndetermine industry average achievable Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants \n(OHAPs) testing at Lime Kilns, specifically for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  Two key considerations of this \nreview were the way in which the MDL was determined in the source testing reports, and the consideration of \nbulk corrections for moisture and oxygen content that are called for in the proposed rule. Brief summaries follow \nimmediately, with more detailed explanations on subsequent pages. \n \nMDL Summary \nIn brief, our position is that EPA selected improper MDLs from the reports by using the standard view of picking \nthe lowest 5.  This inherently selected 4 reports that use a noise value in lieu of a proper MDL, thereby biasing the \noutcome low.  We propose that EPA revisits the achievable detection limit determination by excluding reported \nMDLs that do not conform to EPA\u2019s standards on determining the MDL for FTIR testing. \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Summary \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet (not corrected for moisture) basis and dry corrected basis.  This creates \nsome noise in the data set.  Ultimately the values in the proposed rule do not appear to contain a correction for \nmoisture in the source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other \ncomponents.  For example, if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture corrected basis from \na source that contains 15% moisture that becomes 1.176 ppmvd.  We believe that especially in the case here where \nresults from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same basis, rather than a mix \nof wet and dry corrected results.  As this total result may contain some mix of detected and non-detected \ncompounds, the MDLs used for this level setting should include this adjustment criteria.   \n \nIn a similar vein, as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, we believe some average \nOxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the emissions limit calculation. \n \n \n \n \nMDL Discussion \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data submitted.  Both are from \nASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA Method 320, which is the standard method \nfor FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from stationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL \ndocumentation and are not included in further discussion. \n \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the detector noise in a pure \nblank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound.  This is useful to determine the analytical \nuncertainty of a value but is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \n \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the noise of the detector, but \nwith the inclusion of major matrix interference.  This is generally regarded as a more appropriate MDL \ndetermination since FTIR is an optical measurement, and elevated absorbances from interference can significantly \nimpact the analyzer\u2019s ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration).  Past EPA \nguidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for the purposes of normalizing data. \n \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2.  ( Tables 1 & 2 ).  EPA\u2019s \ncalculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four reports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the \ndetermination of the proposed measurement limit.   \n \nWe propose revisiting the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard directive of using MDC#2 \ncalculated results to determine an appropriate aggregated emissions limit. \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Discussion \nIn the proposed rule, the value of multiple chemical species are summed to determine compliance with a limit that \nis based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration. As such, and values included in the \nsummation must be corrected to this basis.  Therefore, we believe it is logical that for the purposes of setting a \nfloor that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to match before including them in \nthe sum.  From the reports included in this review, the average combined correction factor results in an increase \nof 22% to the results.  However, we recognize that this is a source specific correction factor depending on the \nmoisture and oxygen content native to the source.  As such, attempting to normalize the emissions limit based on \nadjusted results can have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions.  Given the variability, we \npropose taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating the aggregated emissions limit.   \n \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those cases the individual \nsources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table.  Three reports were excluded due to the variety of \ntesting conditions that included abnormally high or low oxygen and moisture concentrations. \n \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) determined by separately \naveraging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average correction factor for each.  These average factors \nwere then combined for a total correction factor.  A second calculation determines the total correction factor for \neach source, then looks at an average of these bulk correction factors.  Both calculations are presented in Table 3.  \nNotably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the \naverage of total factors from each report.   \n \n\nResult of adjustments  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the determination, and accounting for the corrections that must be applied to all \ndata for the purposes of summation, our analysis shows a standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 \nppmvd @7% O2 formaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O2 for acetaldehyde.  We propose that this should be \nconsidered for the purposes of setting an aggregated emissions limit, and there should be strict adherence to an \nappropriate method for calculating MDLs in the reports submitted. \nPlease contact us at (256) 351-0121 or via email at Jordan.Laster@alliancetg.com if you have any questions or \nneed additional information.   \nSincerely, \nJordan Laster \nSenior Vice President \nAlliance Technical Group \n\n"

(Submitted electronically at http://www.regulations.gov\n) \n \nRE: Comments of the National Lime Association on: Supplemental Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking : National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  Amendments , Docket ID No. EPA-\nHQ- OAR-2017-0015, RIN 2060- AV59  \n Dear Sir or Madam:  \n \nThe National Lime Association (NLA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s \nSupplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments  (\u201cProposed Rule\u201d), 89 Fed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. \n9, 2024). NLA is the trade association for manufacturers of high calcium quicklime, dolomitic quicklime, dead -burned dolomitic lime, and hydrated lime, collectively referred to as \u201clime.\u201d \nLime provides cost-effective solutions to many of society\u2019s manufacturing and environmental needs. Lime is a chemical without substitute, providing solutions to many of society\u2019s environmental problems. Lime is a n important ingredient in many other manufacturing processes \nand industries. It is used in the steel m anufacturing process, road building, and the creation of \nother building products like mortar and plaster. Lime is also a critical component in environmental compliance for many industries, as it is used to purify water and scrub  air \npollutants from stack e missions.  \n \nNLA acknowledges the efforts that EPA has made to improve the Proposed Rule from \nthe prior proposal (the \u201cJanuary 2023 Proposed Rule\u201d ), and these improvements will be \ndiscussed in detail in the comments below. NLA continues to believe, however, that the proposal is unnecessary and flawed in significant underlying ways. These comments reflect NLA\u2019s major \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 2 concerns, as well as more technical issues and corrections.1 Major concerns include the \nfollowing:  \n \n1. The Clean Air Act does not require EPA to regulate additional hazardous air pollutants in \nthis proceeding, and EPA should have determined that such a regulation is unnecessary.  \n \n2. EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  will impose billi ons of dollars in economic costs on the lime \nindustry with  minimal benefits. In addition, not only will the Proposed Rule  impose \ntremendous costs, but it will also cause more environmental harm than good.  \n3. EPA should not have sought to set MACT floors for any of the HAPs addressed in the \nProposed Rule , because no lime industry source is controlling for any of these HAPs, and \nthus there are no true \u201cbest performers\u201d in terms of emissions.  \n4. Any standard for HCl should be a health- based standard pursuant to Clean Air Act \nsection 112(d)(4) . NLA commends EPA for seeking comment on this approach but  \nbelieves it should have been the proposed approach. \n \n5. NLA commends EPA for proposing a n intra-quarry variability f actor  (IQV)  for mercury \nemissions but  believes that the data compels a higher  IQV factor . \n \n6. NLA commends EPA for proposing an aggregated organic HAP standard, but believes the proposed standard requires correction . \n \n7. EPA should withdraw its proposed dioxins/furans ( D/F) standard and either collect \nadditional data on D/F emissions in the lime industry before proceeding with a new \nemissions standard or provide the  work practice or alternative compliance method \npreviously requested by NLA .  \n \nThese and other concerns are addressed in detail below.  \n PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nEPA promulgated the National Emis sion Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for \nLime Manufacturing Plants F inal R ule two decades ago . 40 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 63.7080- 7083. In doing so, \nEPA  noted that: \"the purpose of the final NESHAP is to protect public health by reducing \nemissions of HAP f rom lime manufacturing plants.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 394, 395 (Jan. 5, 2004). EPA \ncarefully evaluated the lime manufacturing sector, and regulated HAP emissions by establishing a particulate matter (PM) standard as a surrogate for non- volatile and semi- volatile metal HAP s. \nEPA  fulfilled  its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibil ity Act and the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA)  by reaching out to small lime companies, \nperforming extensive economic analysis on the impacts of the rule, and convening a small \nbusiness panel with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to identify  less burdensome \n \n1 Some of the comments herein mirror comments included in NLA\u2019s comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \ndated Feb. 21, 2023 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015 -0166) . NLA incorporates those comments and their appendices \nherein by reference, but some of the  points  are repeated here for ease of review . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 3 alternatives that would still accomplish EPA\u2019s  regulatory objectives. EPA  also provided a 60- day \ncomment period.  \n \nEPA\u2019s  focus was on protecting public health by reducing HAP emissions  with controls , \nbut only if such controls were \u201cnecessary. \u201d EPA considered, but expressly rejected , regulating \nother HAPs, including the ones at issue in this rulemaking. For example, EPA determined that :  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions f rom lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the \nauthority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is \nnecessary because HCl is a \u201chealth threshold pollutant\u201d and HCl levels emitted from lime \nkilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety.  \n \n69 Fed. Reg. at 397. \n \nEPA\u2019s 2004 rule was successful in balancing its obligations under the CAA to protect \npublic health while only imposing controls that were \u201cnecessary.\u201d This is evidenced by the fact that the rule was not challenged by the lime industry nor by any environmental groups.  \nLikewise, in 2020, EPA  issued a final rule to fulfill its obligations under CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(6) and (f)(2), a.k.a. the \u201crisk and technology review \u201d (RTR).  Here EPA found that : \u201crisks \nare acceptable and that the current NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 44960 (July 24, 2020) . EPA further \ndetermined that: \u201cThere are no develop ments in practices, p rocesses, or control technologies that \nnecessitate revisions to the standards.\u201d Id .  \n \nEPA took a completely different approach in the January 2023 Proposed Rule , and \nlargely continues this approach in the current Proposed Rule . In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, \nEPA proposed extremely stringent requirements that would have imposed enormous costs on the \nlime industry. After this was pointed out in comments by NLA and its members, and by the Small Business Administration  (SBA), EPA agreed that it needed to perform a more detailed \nanalysis of the cost impacts of the rule on small businesses. EPA and SBA convened a review \npanel under the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Enforcement Act (SBREFA), which was held on August 3, 2023. Aft er the panel procedure, EPA proceeded to issue the current Proposed \nRule, which incorporates many of the recommendations made through the panel process.  \n NLA commends EPA for participating in the SBREFA review  and for responding to \nconcerns raised during the process . NLA also notes that EPA\u2019s estimate of the costs of the new \nProposed Rule are more realistic and  much higher than those estimated for the January 2023 \nProposed Rule. These high costs, coupled with EPA\u2019s repeated determinations that the existing rule presents acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety, even with no new standards, are \nwhat has led NLA , as well as the Small Business Panel,  to ur ge EPA to identify as many ways to \nminimize the impact of the Proposed Rule on the lime industry as possible. \n EPA is not pursuing this rulemaking process because of risks to the public or the \nenvironment, but because of court decisions  that are imposing unnecessary  deadlines and \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 4 substantive requirements that are nowhere found in \u00a7 112(d)(6) of the Clean Air Act .2 Despite \nthe fact that EPA has consistently determined for over two decades that risks from lime plant \nemissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and thus that additional MACT regulations for the lime industry sector are unnecessary , EPA  is pushing to complete this \nrulemaking as soon as possible because of  a court -ordered deadline of June 30, 2024, for the \npromulgation of a final rule to regulate four additional pollutants whether EPA believes new standards are necessary or not.  TECHNICAL BACKGROUND  \n The Proposed Rule continues to reflect a lack of technical understanding of  the lime \nindustry in several important respects . Below is a discussion providing technical background on \nhow lime kilns and their HAP emissions interact. Specifically, the discussion below relates to the four additional HAP s addressed in the Proposed Rule : HCl (hydrogen chloride), Hg (mercury), \noHAP (organic Hazardous Air Pollutants), and D/F (dioxins and furans).   \n Lime  kilns differ substantially from  traditional fuel combustion sources and  kilns from \nother industrial sectors in how HAPs are emitted and controlled. For example, fossil fuel -fired \nboilers and heaters and  tunnel kilns used to manufacture brick or ceramics exhibit significantly \ndifferent  emissions formation phenomenon and emissions gas stream characteristics from those \nfound in lime kilns , and thus basing assumptions on performance of these devices, as EPA \nappears to have done, has led  to errors in analysis, and the failure to consider important factors \nthat will affect cost and performance of air pollution control devices in lime plants .\n3 The \noperation of these non- lime sources differ substantially from the operation of lime plants, in \nparticular with respect to the temperature s necessary to achieve calcination  in a lime kiln  and the \nlong- life requirements of lime plant design and operation near a quarry. These non- lime sources \nare further  not involved in continuously operating process es in a lime plant that have many tons \nper hour of a circulating product load. These operational realities, formation mechanisms, and exhaust gas stream characteristics are very dif ferent  for a lime kiln than for a typical combustion \ndevice or tunnel kiln. Comparison with cement kilns can also lead to erroneous conclusions, because cement kilns differ substantially from lime kilns due to the variety of feedstocks and fuels, and the differences in processes . Below is a brief discussion for each newly regulated \nHAP.  \n \n\u2022 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) .  The formation of HCl is incidental to the lime production \nprocess and is a function of the temperatures required to make lime, the fuels used for their energy value, and constituents found in the raw material input (limestone) to the \n \n2 Despite meeting its obligations of CAA \u00a7 112(d)(6) and (f)(2) by issuing a final  RTR rule in 2020, EPA takes the \nposition that it must issue a new rule following the decision in Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA , \n955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (\u201cLEAN \u201d). As set forth in these comments,  EPA misinterprets LEAN  to require a \nrevised standard here despite EPA\u2019s RTR findings of no residual risks or available new technologies. Further, even \nif EPA\u2019s interpretation of LEAN  was correct, NLA asserts that the LEAN case was wrongly decided and should be \nrevisited and reversed by the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court.  \n3 NLA recognizes  that EPA in the Supplemental Proposed Rule has substantially revised its costs estimates to better \nalign with industry\u2019s cost estimates. Nevertheless, there remain  substantial technical uncertainties  as to whether  any \nof the candidate MACT technologies will achieve the proposed limit s and therefore even EPA\u2019s increased cost \nestimates incorporate significant economic uncertainty.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 5 kilns. Given that the lime kiln process is alkaline in nature, its environment already \noffers an inherent reduction of acid gas emissions, including HCl, without any additional controls. The proposed MACT standard starts from a floor that is based on the few lowest emitting sources and then proceeds to require the installation of expensive controls to attempt to reduce very low levels to even lower levels without conclusive data on the feasibility  of those controls.   \n \n\u2022 Mercury.   Emissions of mercury are low from lime kilns. Mercury  can be emitted in \neither its elemental or ionic (oxidized) form at ratios that will require extensive study and design controls for lime kilns subject to the rule. Unlike typical combustion systems, where emitted mercury  is solely a function of levels  in fuels, a lime kiln also \ncan see contributions to emissions from trace levels of mercury that naturally occur in limestone. The large quarries  at lime plants  have natural variability in such tra ce \ncompounds. Given the requirement that large volumes of stone are necessary to make lime and the long-term capital investment needed to build and operate a lime plant, most lime plants are located near their limestone source with decades -long \noperational and mining plans. NLA produced and provided to EPA significant volumes of data on mercury, and demonstrated how EPA should apply an int ra-\nquarry variability (IQV) factor to account for variability of mercury in stone feedstocks.    \n \n\u2022 Organic HAPs .  Emissions of organic HAPs from lime kilns are very low in quantity \nand in the number of individual HAPs. These organic HAPs can be formed incidentally during combustion in the kiln  and can also be formed by miniscule \namounts of naturally occurring organics contained in limestone that decompose at lower temperatures and randomly form organic HAPs. To address these very small amounts of organic HAPs, EPA previously proposed to set a MACT floor for total hydrocarbons (THC) as a surrogate. EPA has now proposed a superior aggregated oHAP approach, although, as detailed below, it requires some important corrections .   \n \n\u2022 Dioxins and Furans.  Dioxins and furans ( D/F) are emitted in extremely low \nquantities  from lime kilns , and in some cases are not detectable at all . Many lime \nkilns affected by this rule may  not have detectable levels of D/F and yet will be \nsubject to burdensome testing in perpetuity. The formation of D/F is incidental in a lime kiln where organics and chlorides are  available to form barely detectable levels \nof D/F  (in the part s per billion range) in some kilns. Despite EPA\u2019s own studies and \ndocumentation in the prior Lime MACT and RTR rulemakings confirming the extremely low level s of D/F from lime kilns, EPA has proposed the most stringent \nlimit available .   \n       \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 6 GENERAL ISSUES  \n \nI. THE CLEAN AIR ACT DOES NOT REQUIRE  EPA TO REGULATE \nADDITIONAL  HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS IN THIS PROCEEDING  \n \nThere are two key reasons why EPA should not be engaged in this rulemaking. First, any \nlawsuits or petitions demanding revisions to the underlying lime MACT standard are time -\nbarred, and thus EPA is under no legal obligation to engage in this rulemaking. Second, even if \nnot time -barred, it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d in this residual risk and technology (RTR) proceeding to \nissue four new  MACT standard s. \n \nA. EPA Should Not Have Undertaken to Rewrite the Lime Manufacturing \nMACT Standard Because All Parties Are Time- Barred from Challenging \nThat Standard  \n EPA is undertaking this revision to the existing lime MACT standard in this RTR \nproceeding because environmental petitioners requested that it do so following the DC Circuit\u2019s \nopinion in Louisiana Environmental Action Network  v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) \n(\u201cLEAN \u201d). However,  environmental petitioners are time -barred from challenging the underlying \nlime MACT standard because they failed to do so within 60 days  following promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard in 2004, and thus there is no legal obligation for EPA to undertake this \nrulemaking.  \n \nSection 307(b) of the Clean Air Act requires any party to initiate a challenge for EPA\u2019s \nfailure to set hazardous air pollutant (HAP) standards within 60 days from promulgation of the \noriginal MACT standard. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7601(b)(1). This requirement is juri sdictional, and a court \ncannot waive or lengthen it. Med . Waste Inst. & Energy Recovery Council v. EPA , 645 F.3d 420, \n427 (D.C. Cir. 2011); NRDC v. EPA, 571 F.3d 1245, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The LEAN  court \nacknowledged the argument but  did not address it o r rule on its merits.  This limitation on \njudicial review of EPA actions serves an \u201cimportant reason: to enforce repose so that the rulemaking process is not crippled by surprise challenges to matters that were rightfully presumed settled  . . .\u201d EME Homer City Generation, L .P. v. EPA, 696 F.3d 7, 38 (D.C. Cir. \n2012), rev\u2019d on other grounds , 572 U.S. 489 (2014) (Rogers, J., dissenting). Further, this \njurisdictional timeline protects the regulated industry by allowing industry to plan for compliance obligatio ns. Cf. Lead Indus. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. EPA , 647 F.2d 1184, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (observing \nthat the CAA\u2019s strict deadlines for completing the steps to promulgate ambient air quality standards, and the limitation on stays pending petitions for reconsideration in CAA section \n307(d)(7)(B), are evide nce of \u201ca strong congressional desire that the procedure for establishing \nair quality standards be completed expeditiously and with considerable finality\u201d).  \n \nHere, the underlying lime MACT standard was promulgated in 2004, 69 Fed. Reg. 394 \n(Jan. 5, 2004). The challenge to EPA\u2019s RTR rule  (challenging EPA\u2019s decision not to regulate \nadditional HAPs in the original MACT rule)  was not filed until September 22, 2020, over 16 \nyears beyond the 60- day judicial review period established by Congress. Accordingly, any \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 7 challenge to the existing MACT standard would be time -barred, and thus EPA is under no legal \nobligation to initiate this rulemaking.4  \n \nFurthermore, the time bar argument is stronger in the context of the lime MACT standard \nthan it was in the LEAN  case, because all the pollutants addressed in this new rulemaking were \nexplicitly addressed in the original lime MACT rulemaking in 2004. This is not a case in which HAPs were ignored or inadvertently omitted, but rather a case in which EPA specifically  decided \nthat regulation was not necessary, a decision that was not challenged at the time. \n Thus, for HC l, in the 2004 MACT rule, EPA explicitly  performed a review under CAA \nsection 112(d)(4). Below is what EPA stated in the final rule preamble:  \n \nWe are not regulating HCl emissions from lime kilns in the final NESHAP. Under the authority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined that no further control is necessary because HCl is a \u2018\u2018health threshold pollutant,\u2019\u2019 and HCl levels emitted fr om \nlime kilns are below the threshold value within an ample margin of safety. See generally, \n67 FR 78054\u2013057. As explained there, the risk analysis sought to assure that emissions from every source in the category result in exposures less than the threshol d level even \nfor an individual exposed at the upper end of the exposure distribution. The upper end of the exposure distribution is calculated using the \u2018\u2018high end exposure estimate,\u2019\u2019 defined as a plausible estimate of individual exposure for those persons at the upper end of the exposure distribution, conceptually above the 90th percentile, but not higher than the individual in the population who has the highest exposure. We believe that assuring protection to persons at the upper end of the exposure dist ribution is consistent with the \n\u2018\u2018ample margin of safety\u2019\u2019 requirement in section 112(d)(4). In the proposed rule, we published the results of the risk analysis on which we based this decision. More information on the risk analysis may be found in the publ ished proposed rule (67 FR \n78054\u201378057) and in the docket. We received only one comment on our risk analysis. \n 69 Fed. Reg. 398.\n5  \n \nEPA explicitly state d that it was  making this determination under the authority of section \n112(d)(4) \u2014it is not a matter of EPA  simply deciding that it did not need to regulate HCl because \nof low risk. Because EPA explicitly found in 2004 that HCl was a threshold pollutant, and that the criteria of section 112(d)(4) were satisfied \u2014and no one challenged the rule \u2014any legal \nchallenge to that determination is now time -barred.  \n  EPA also addressed mercury in the 2004 rule preamble, choosing not to issue a mercury \nstandard because: \u201cThe only control technique would reflect control of the raw materials and/or fossil fuels. This control is not duplicable or replicable. We also determined that an emissions \n \n4 To the extent that the LEAN  court could be deemed to have ruled against the time bar argument, NLA respectfully \nsubmits that the case was wrongly decided, for the reasons stated in these comments. The decision was not appealed \nby any party. NLA was not a party, but rather an amicus in that case , and thus was not able to appeal the decision.  \n5 See docket items EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0767 and EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0052 -0768 for more information on \nthe extensive risk assessment performed for HCl in the original lime MACT rule.  NLA incorporates those \ndocuments into these comments by reference.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 8 limit for mercury based on a beyond- the-MACT -floor option is not justified after consideration \nof the cost, energy, and non- environmental impacts.\u201d 69 Fed. Reg. 398. EPA received no adverse \ncomments on this approach and the final rule was not challenged.  \n \n For organics and dioxins/furans, EPA\u2019s technical contractor explained the decision not to \nissue standards in a memorandum in the docket. EPA \u2019s contractor  stated that there was \nessentially no data suggesting organics were emitted . The contractor stated that after a review of \nemissions test data, \u201c[o]nly one test reported any emissions of organic HAPs from lime manufacturing\u2026\u201d Docket No. A -95-41, Item No. II-B-121 at 1. For dioxins and furans, the \ncontractor stated : \u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners a re well -documented, but are shown \nto be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not collected in this search.\u201d Id. \n  Thus, EPA addressed all these HAPs in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and its \ndeterminations were unchallenged until this effort to bootstrap such challenges into the RTR rulemaking. EPA should rely on its prior reasonable decisions , should withdraw the Proposed \nRule  and should reject any effort to bring challenges as  legally time -barred.  \n \nB. EPA Should Not Revise the MACT Standard for Lime Manufacturing \nBecause it is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d to Do So, Given EPA\u2019s RTR Findings of No \nResidual Risks or  Available New Technologies  \n \nThe LEAN court held that \u201c\u2026because the Act necessitates section 112 compliant \nemission standards for each source category, and section 112(d)(6) requires EPA at least every \neight years to review and revise emissions standards \u2018as necessary,\u2019 EPA\u2019s section 112(d)(6)  \nreview of a source category\u2019s emission standard must address all listed air toxics the source category emits.\u201d LEAN , 955 F.3d at 1091. U nder that decision, EPA must \u201c address\u201d  whether any \nfurther regulation of listed air toxics is \u201c necessary ,\u201d in its discr etion. For lime manufacturing , \nEPA already \u201caddressed\u201d this in 2004, and found, in promulgating the lime RTR standard, that \nthere were no residual risks  and no technological advances of note, and therefore  no reason to \nrevise the MACT standard for the source category. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44965- 66. EPA\u2019s own \nscientific assessment confirmed this determination in 2020 when it found lime emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety. Hence, EPA in its discretion may, and in NLA\u2019s opinion, must reasonably conclude that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d to revise the MACT standard any further, consistent with LEAN.\n6 \n \n6 Notwithstanding LEAN,  the plain language of s ection 112(d)(6) requires only technology review. Therefore, \nsection 112(d)(6) cannot be used to address  unregulated HAPs from a MACT standard \u2013  other provisions of the \nstatute ( sections 112(d)(2) and (3)) fulfill that purpose. Section 112(d)(6) is meant to be a review only of any \ntechnological advances in the eight years after promulgation of a M ACT standard, and nothing more. Courts have \nagreed with this reading of the Clean Air Act and  have found that the focus of the section 112(d)(6) periodic review \nis on new developments in pollution control or prevention technologies since the prior promulgation. See, e.g ., Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n for Surface Finishing v. EPA , 795 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (holding that section 112(d)(6) provides for a \n\u201crecurring technology review\u201d to determine \u201cwhether standards should be tightened in view of developments in \ntechnologies and practices since the standard\u2019s promulgation or las t revision, and, in particular, the cost and \nfeasibility of developments and corresponding emissions savings\u201d); Blue Ridge Env tl.

EPA Should Consider Factors Including Cost  and Acceptable Risk  to \nDetermine that the Proposed Rule Is Not \u201c Necessary. \u201d \nNLA believes that, consistent with Clean Air Act Section 112(d) (2), 42 U.S.C. Section \n7412(d)(2) , EPA has substantial discretion to consider all relevant factors to determine whether \nstandards for unregulated HAPs are \u201cnecessary\u201d in an RTR rulemaking, including but not limited \nto: what proportion of the affected sources are actually known to emit the HAP; how close to a \ndetection limit the concentrations are; whether the concentrations are likely to be reduced \nsignificantly by imposing an additional technol ogy-based limitation; whether the technology that \nis in effect for HAPs already regulated will also control the \u201cmissing HAP\u201d; and how cost  \neffective additional controls would be (since s ection 112(d)(6) allows costs to be taken into \naccount).  \n The costs  of this rule are significant . EPA\u2019s own cost analysis states that this rule will \nimpose cost s on 34 major sources of  between $2.01 billion and $2.43 billion. This includes \ncapital costs of $1.04 billion in year one, plus an additional annual cost of $174 million \nthereafter . These impacts are monumental for an industry that the U.S. Geological Service \nestimates receives  $2.3 billion in annual revenues.  \n \nEPA says that this rule \u201cis expected to increase the price of lime and reduce lime \nproduction and consumption from baseline levels.\u201d EPA  states  that under the rule, the price of \nlime will increase by 5.9%,  domestic production is estimated to decline  by 1.5% , imports are \nestimated to increase by 12.3% , and exports are expected to decline  by 6.7% . NLA believes that \nthese impacts are understated, because lime plants will also need to allocate a significant portion \nof their own lime production for use in dry sorbent injection systems to control HCl emissions. Rather than causing a 1.5% reduction in lime produced, if the lime allocated for HCl control is counted in that figure , reductions  in lime production could be several times that amount \nnationwide. There is evidence in the record that lime plants may need to use as much as 8% of their own hydrated lime product to meet the HCl standard. See  Greer Lime Company Comments , \nFeb. 21, 2023, at p. 5. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0167. \n EPA attempts to justify these costs by asserting that:  \n \nThis industry is regulated by EPA because pollutants emitted from lime manufacturing facilities are considered to cause or contribute significantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health \u2026The proposed requirements are \nbeing considered to address unacceptable health risks linked to emissions from lime manufacturing facilities and to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health.  \n See Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) \nat p. 45.

See Surface Finishing, 795 \nF.3d at 8- 9; Ass\u2019n of Battery Recyclers  v. EPA , 716 F.3d 667,  673-74 (D.C. Cir. 2013) .  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 10  \nThese statement s are demonstrably false, and directly contradict EPA\u2019s own repeated \nfindings that emissions from the lime industry are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety. Lime industry emissions are not endangering public health, nor are those  emissions levels \ncausing unacceptable health risks to the public. EPA must acknowledge this error and correct it in the final rule.  \n \n The costs of the rule cited by EPA are understated because they analyze the pollutants \none at a time and do not consider the m as a group. For some pollutants, high temperatures are \nrequired to reduce emissions. For other pollutants, controls will not be effective above a certain \ntemperature range. Lime plants that need to control multiple pollutants will need to spend \nsignificant resources on both heating and cooling at the same operation. These costs are not \nadequately reflected in EPA \u2019s analysis.  \n \nThe benefits of the rule are minimal, and in fact  are so negligible that  EPA  does not even \nattempt to quantify them: \u201cThe EPA did not monetize  the benefits from the estimated emission \nreductions of HAP associated with this final action. The EPA currently does not have sufficient methods to monetize benefits associated with HAP, HAP reductions and risk reductions for this \nrulemaking.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 9,099 (Feb. 9, 2024).   \n In addition, 97.7%  of HAP emission reductions claimed by EPA  come from HCl controls \namounting to reductions of  884 tons per year  (out of 905 tons per year total for all four HAPs) . \nBut EPA  has already determined  that even with no HCl controls : \u201cThe results of the exposure \nassessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production \nfacilities are well below the health threshold value  *** Furthermore, no significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. \u201d 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. \n2002). That is why EPA  found, twice, that risks from lime manufacturing emissions are \n\u201cacceptable with an ample margin of safety ,\u201d and thus additional controls would not yield \nsignificant benefits .  \n Reductions of other HAPs are even less significant. EPA\u2019s own analysis demonstrates \nthat the Proposed Rule , if implemented, would decrease organic  HAPs by only 20 tons/year in \ntotal. M ercury w ould be reduced by only a fraction of a ton ( 0.32 tons/year ). Dioxins and f urans \nreductions are almost too small to measure at 0.000000047 tons/year. The HAP reductions are so small that EPA said that: \u201cthere is no value reported in this table for monetized benefits and the \nnet benefits of this rule are unclear.\u201d Although EPA claims that \u201cthe proposed changes will have \nbeneficial effects on air quality and public health for populations exposed to emissions from lime \nmanufacturing facilities,\u201d this claim of public health benefits is contradicted by EPA \u2019s own risk \nassessment which found that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety.  \n \n2. Because The Rule Will Cause More Environmental Harm than Benefit, It  \nIs Not \u201cNecessary ,\u201d And Lacks a Rational Basis  \n \nThe Proposed Rule  will, on a net basis, do more environmental harm than good. While \nthe rule may  result in some  minimal reduction in HAPs that EPA has already determined a re well \nwithin acceptable levels , the rule will c ause a significant and unnecessary:  (1) increase in \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 11 greenhouse gas emissions and other air emissions ; (2) wast e of lime products that could be used \nto address other environmental problems; (3) addition  of waste streams for landfills ; and (4) \nwaste of water and energy resources to run unnecessary pollution control devices.  \n \nTo meet the requirements of reducing organics emissions by as few as 20 tons per year, \nEPA predicts  that several lime plants will need to install expensive and unnecessary regenerative \nthermal oxidizers (RTOs) to control such emissions. RTOs run on natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, the combustion of which generates greenhouse gas es. The direct result of this new \nregulation will be that tens of thousands of tons of CO\n2 will be unnecessarily released into the \natmosphere, contributing to climate change. This is the equivalent of adding thousands of passenger vehicles on America\u2019s roads , but without any passengers. In addition, any natural gas \nunnecessarily consumed in this process would be another wasted resource that could have been \nused for another beneficial purpose such as heating homes, producing cleaner electricity, or storage for future use.  In addition to carbon dioxide, combustion of fuel in RTO s will result in \nthe emission of other pollutants such as NOx and carbon monoxide. \nLime is a valuable resource that can be used for many environmentally beneficial \npurposes. But EPA\u2019s rule would force lime companies to use significant amounts of their own \nproduct to reduce HCl emissions that EPA  has twice found to pose acceptable risk with an ample \nmargin of safety. Dry sorbent injection requires lime to reduce HCl emissions. Instead of using \nthat lime for unneeded HCl emissions  reductions, that same lime could be used to make other \nmuch more significant environmental improvements. For example, two  tons of lime used for flue \ngas desulfurization could reduce SO 2 emissions by one ton. SO 2 is a criteria air pollutant, and \nEPA describes its effects as follows : \nShort-term exposures to SO 2 can harm the human respiratory system and make breathing \ndifficult. People with asthma, particularly children, are sensitive to these effects of SO 2. \nSO 2 emissions that lead to high concentrations of SO 2 in the air generally also lead to the \nformation of other sulfur oxides (SO x). SO x can react with other compounds in the \natmosphere to form small particles. These particles contribute to particulate matter (PM) \npollution. Small particles  may penetrate deeply into the lungs and in sufficient quantity \ncan contribute to health problems. \n \nSulfur Dioxide Basics | Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Pollution | US EPA \n \nLime is also  used by municipal and other water treatment plants across the United States \nto treat drinking water for the public. In this context, one ton of lime can soften over 450,000 gallons of drinking water. Likewise, lime is  instrumental in treating acid mine drainage f rom \nhistoric mining operations. Lime  neutralizes toxic acid mine drainage by raising its pH levels . \nUsed in this context, one ton of lime can treat  over 5 million gallons of water that will ultimately \nbe discharged into streams and other water bodies.  \n Imposing unnecessary regulations that  waste valuable lime resources in this way will \nhave unintended and detrimental environmental and economic consequences. These include making lime less available in the supply chain for environmentally beneficial uses, increasing the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 12 cost of lime for all users, and causing more lime to be produced than is currently necessary . \nIncreasing lime production will result in an  inefficient use of finite natural resources , including \nwasting limestone quarries  and the fuel used to produce the lime, as well as even more increased \nand unnecessary air emissions.  \n \nEPA\u2019s rule requiring reductions of HAPs by using activated carbon injection (ACI) will \npotentially create a significant new waste stream that will need to be landfilled in the environment. A lime plant that must install ACI may produce tons of additional waste annually. EPA policy should be to minimize waste streams into the environment --not to increase them , \nparticularly where EPA  has already determined that existing air emissions from lime plants are \ncurrently acceptable with an ample margin of safety, even without new standards.  \n Finally, EPA\u2019s own analysis acknowledges  that the imposition of new emissions \nstandards will result in secondary impacts from  projected  controls required for compliance with \nthe proposed standards. EPA expects lime plants to use 1.12 million additional gallons of water per year to address HCl controls with wet packed tower gas absorbers (WPTGAs) . EPA  predicts \nthat s olid waste from WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection, and A ctivated Carbon I njection will \nincrease solid waste by 13,400 tons per year. And finally, EP A states that all types of pollution \ncontrols installed under this rule (including WPTGAs, Dry Sorbent Injection; Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers; Activated Carbon Injection; and Heat Exchangers) will collectively use an \nadditional 696 billion  Btu\u2019s of energy annually. According to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s \nEnergy Information Agency, the average ton of coal in the U.S. contains about 20.1 million Btus of energy. This means it would take over 34,000 tons of coal annually to produce that many Btus of energy. See EIA Frequently Asked Questions\n. \n The rule will reduce HAP emissions slightly, but in quantities so small that EPA  was \nunable to quantify the benefits of such reductions. In addition, EPA\u2019s own best available science shows that HAPs do not need to be further reduced to protect public health and the environment. But the rule will also lead inevitably to significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions, wasting of valuable lime products that could be better used to solve other environmental challenges, wasting of water and energy resources, and a significant and unnecessary increase in solid waste streams.  For all these reasons, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule is unnecessary and lacks a \nrational  basis  because it will cause more environmental harm than good, andany interpretation of \nthe statute that suggests that EPA is required to promulgate a regulation that causes more environmental harm than benefit also lacks a rational basis . Promulgating the rule as proposed, \nwithout adequately considering costs and environmental impacts, would be arbitrary and capricious.  \n \n3. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because Its Benefits Are De \nMinimis  \n LEAN did not overrule the seminal D.C. Circuit decision of Alabama Power v. Costle , \n636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1979), which held, in the context of the Clean Air Act\u2019s PSD regulations, that every rule  inherently contains a de minimis criterion. So, if regulation of \nadditional HAPs in this potential revised lime RTR proceeding would only have de minimis environmental benefits given the lack of residual risk or technology improvements, it is not \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 13 necessary for EPA to impose additional controls  to \u201caddress\u201d such HAPs. Although EPA has \ntaken the position that section 112(d)(6) does not allow for a de minimis exception7, the U.S. \nSupreme Court has held that the de minimis  doctrine is a legal principle that forms part of the \nestablished background against which all statutes  are enacted. Wisc. Dep\u2019t of Rev. v. William \nWrigley, Jr., Co., 505 U.S. 214, 231 (1992), and this has been subsequently reiterated by the \nD.C. Circuit. New York v. EPA , 443 F.3d 880, 888 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u201c de minimis  requirements \nserve to alleviate severe administrative and economic burdens by lifting requirements on \n\u2018minuscule \u2019 emission increases \u201d) (internal quotations omitted).  In this case the benefits of the \nrule as proposed are truly de minimis , as compared to the negative environmental impacts and the \neconomic costs, an d the standards  set are extremely low (in several cases based on levels of non -\ndetection) . EPA should decline to impose these requirements.   \n \n4. The Proposed Rule Is Not \u201cNecessary\u201d Because the HAPs in the Rule \nWere Addressed in the 2004 Rulemaking  \n Another reason that it is not \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set standards for additional HAPs \nthrough the rulemaking here is because, as noted above, all the relevant HAPs were addressed in the 2004 MACT rulemaking, and EPA expressed clear reasons for its decision not to set standards for them, reasons that went unchallenged. In this case, it is not necessary to \u201cfix\u201d any problem with the original MACT rule, because there is no such problem. This is further confirmed by the conclusion of EPA\u2019s risk assessment, whi ch addressed all these HAPs and \nfound no need to impose additional standards on any of them. \n Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 by adding sections  112(d)(2) and (d)(3) \nwhich require EPA to establish MACT floor standards for existing sources based on the average of the best performing 12% of each industry sector. Congress took this step because it believed that EPA  was too slow in assessing risks and adopting air emissionstandards.. But unlike the \nsituation where risks from industry emissions are unknown, in this case there are two risk assessments and EPA  findings that emissions from the lime industry are acceptable with an \nample margin of safety. Under such circumstances, it is not only \u201cunnecessary\u201d for EPA to issue \nMACT floor standards, but irrational and contrary to the intent of the Act. Issuing standards that \nEPA  knows to be unnecessary to protect the public health and the environment is arbitrary and \ncapricious and cannot be c onsistent with what Congress intended in the Clean Air Act.  \n \nCongress clearly expressed its view in Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(f)(2) that additional \nregulation in the absence of risk is unnecessary. That section addresses the situation where risks are known (as in this rulemaking) following an appropriate scientific risk assessment by EPA. It \ninstructs EPA  to promulgate additional standards only if required to provide an ample margin of \nsafety to protect public health or to prevent an adverse environmental effect : \n *** the Administrator shall, within 8 years after promulgation of s tandards for each \ncategory or subcategory of sources pursuant to subsection (d), promulgate standards for \nsuch category or subc ategory if promulgation of such standards is required in order to \nprovide an ample margin of safety to protect public health in accordance with this section  \n \n7 See e.g. , EPA Response to Comments for Portland Cement Industry NESHAP, 64 Fed. Reg. 31898, 31911 (June \n14, 1999).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 14 *** or to prevent , taking into consideration costs, energy, safety, and other relevant \nfactors, an adverse environmental effect.  \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(f)(2).  \n \nYet EPA found as recently as 2020 that risks  from emissions of the lime manufacturing \nindustry are acceptable with an ample margin of safety : \n In this action, we are finalizing our proposed determination that risks from the source \ncategory are acceptable, the standards provide an ample margin of safety to protect public \nhealth, and more stringent standards are not necessary to prevent an adverse environmental effect.  \n 85 Fed. Reg. 44,963 (July 24, 2020).  \n \nAccordingly, since EPA\u2019s own scientific findings demonstrate that promulgating new \nstandards is not \u201crequired\u201d to provide an ample margin of safety to protect public health, there is \nno statutory requirement for EPA to revise the lime manufacturing sector\u2019s MACT standards  by \nadding these  four additional HAPs.  This view is also shared by many Members of Congress, \nincluding several  on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who stated that:  \n \nSince EPA has already found that such standards are not required to provide an ample \nmargin of safety, new regulations are not \u201cnecessary.\u201d EPA should withdraw the \nproposed rule and reiterate that new regulations are not necessary in this instance to \ncomply with the LEAN v. EPA decision and \u00a7112 of the Clean Air Act. \n Congressional Letter to EPA Administrator Regan, Dec. 8, 2023, at pp. 2 -3. \n \nFinally, the LEAN decision must be read in the context of the Supreme Court \u2019s recent \nopinion in West Virginia v EPA , which was decided post -LEAN . In that case, the Supreme Court \nheld that for \u201cmajor questions\u201d \u2013 like the scope of EPA\u2019s authority to issue greenhouse gas regulations for existing power plants under s ection 111(d) of the Clean Air Act \u2013 EPA must \ndemonstrate that Congress gave it specific authority for its regulatory action. West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022) . Surely, the question of w hether EPA can reach back decades in an \nRTR proceeding ( under s ections 112(f) and 112(d)(6) ) and  find that a provision of the Clean Air \nAct that was designed to require review for technological advances somehow compels EPA to reopen a MACT standard (issued under s ections 112(d)(2) and (3)) is a major one. Congress did \nnot give EPA that authority. Accordingly, EPA\u2019s Proposed Rule  is unlawful. \n II. EPA COULD NOT LEGALLY ESTABLISH MACT FLOORS FOR ANY OF THE \nPOLLUTANTS ADDRESSED IN THIS RULEMAKING  \n \nEPA states that: \u201cThese MACT standards are based on emissions levels that are already \nbeing achieved by the best -controlled and lowest -emitting sources in an industry.\u201d Regulatory \nImpact Analysis for the Supplemental Proposed Amendments to the National Emissions \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 15 Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants  (Dec. 14, 2023) at p. 46. \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0208. \n \nTo the contrary, none  of the sources in the lime industry are controlled for these HAPs, \nand therefore none of them can fairly be considered the \u201cbest controlled.\u201d The sources cited by \nEPA are the \u201clowest emitting sources .\u201d But the Clean Air Act does  not say \u201clowest emittin g;\u201d \ninstead it says \u201cbest perform ing.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A). As noted above, NLA does not \nbelieve that it is \u201cnecessary\u201d for EPA to set any new emissions standards for the lime industry in \nthis rulemaking. However, if EPA decides  to set standards for additional HAPs, NLA believes \nthat EPA may not establish MACT floors for  HAPs when there are no current controls in place at \nany source. Rather, EPA must consider costs and other factors in setting standards.  \n \nNo lime plants currently use any add- on control technology to control emissions of any of \nthe four HAPs involved in this rulemaking. Differences in emissions are not the result of \ncontrols, but rather result from differences in feedstocks (stone and fuel), and operation of lime plant equipment. NLA believes that it is anomalous, and contrary to what was intended when the Clean Air Act air toxics provisions were written, to suggest that a source with lower \nconcentrations of a HAP in stone in its quarry (for e xample) is somehow the \u201cbest performer\u201d in \nterms of controlling emissions of that HAP. Thus, NLA believes that it is improper to set a \nMACT floor based on such emissions data. NLA is aware that EPA takes a contrary view, but the facts of this case\u2014in which stringent standards are being imposed even with a finding of acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety for HAPs that are not being controlled by any source \u2014justify a reconsideration of EPA\u2019s position.  \n Instead of setting MACT floors, EPA should have approached all four HAPs using the \nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(d)(2), which provides:  \n \nEmissions standards promulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or existing \nsources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the maximum degree of reduction in \nemissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to this section (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non- air quality health and \nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements, determines is achievable for new  or \nexisting sources in the category or subcategory to which such emission standard applies \u2026 \n NLA does not believe that this point is inconsistent with  National Lime Ass'n v. E.P.A , \n233 F.3d 625 (D.C. Cir. 2000) , or Sierra Club v. E.P.A ., 479 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 2007) . In those \ncases, EPA set a \u201cfloor\u201d of no control where no technology controls were in place. The court held that the statu te requires an emissions standard for each HAP, even where no technology \ncontrols are in place. However, in neither case did the court rule that EPA must set a MACT \nfloor to  set the standard, nor did it give guidanc e to EPA on how to do so. In Sierra Club v. EPA , \nNo. 15- 1487 (D.C. Cir. July 6, 2018) , industry petitioners argued that EPA\u2019s rule would require \nraw material substitution . The Court noted again that the statute requires standards for all HAPs, \neven if emissions differences are due to differences in feedstocks, but goes on to state that it was \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 16 not necessary to rule on those grounds, because EPA\u2019s standard did not require raw material \nsubstitution in the first place.  \n NLA believes that EPA should consider the \u201c cost of achieving such emission reduction, \nand any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements \u201d in setting \nstandards when  there are no technology controls in place. Indeed, the concept of the MACT floor \nis that a percentage of the source category can  achieve a certain  level of control , typically with \nthe use of already -installed air pollution control technology. This is why the statu te refers to such \nsources as \u201cbest performers.\u201d The id ea was that it was fair to require additional sources to apply \nthe same controls as the \u201cbest performers\u201d  because the \u201cbest performers\u201d were presumably able \nto bear the costs of those controls. Differences in the makeup of onsite quarries is not \u201cperformance,\u201d it is  pure chance .  \n As explained above, the costs of the Proposed Rule are extremely high, and the \nenvironmental benefits are extremely low, and even negative when energy use , additional carbon \ndioxide emissions, and generation of additional wastes are considered . EPA should withdraw the \nProposed Rule and abandon its MACT floor approach to the lime industry, and instead should set standards that are protective of human health and the environment, without imposing unnecessary costs on the lime industry, including its small businesses.  \n \nIII. EPA \u2019S PROPOSED RULE VIOLATES CLEAN AIR ACT  SECTION 307 \n A. EPA Violated the Clean Air Act by Not Publishing the Proposed Rule Language in the Federal Register  \n EPA proposed this rule\u2014as it also did with the January 2023 Proposed Rule\u2014without \npublishing any proposed rule language in the Federal Register . Rather than  setting forth \nproposed language, EPA instead included a redline version of the current regulations in the docket, to indicate  what the proposed revisions would be. This docket entry is not a lawful \nsubstitute for publishing actual rule language \u2013 it is a rule that the lime industry must comply \nwith, not the preamble, and not a document tucked away in the record for the rulemaking. Failing to publish such language means that commenters do not have a meaningful opportunity to submit comments on the Proposed Rule. Failure to publish the rule language in the Federal Register  also \nviolates s ection 307(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act which requires:  \n \n\u2026any rule to which this subsection applies, notice of proposed rulemaking shall be \npublished in the Federal Register\u2026 \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3). \n \nWhen proposing a rule, EPA must properly publish proposed rule language in the \nFederal Register . The comment period for a Proposed Rule cannot begin until the actual  \nproposed rule language is published in the Federal Re gister . \n  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 17 B. EPA Violated the Statement of Basis and Purpose Requirement by Failing to \nInclude a Summary of the Major Legal Interpretations and Policy \nConsiderations Underlying the Proposed Rule   \n \nThe 2024 Proposed Rule reverses important determinations made in the original lime \nMACT standard issued in 2004 without mention, comment,  or explanation by EPA . Although it \nsolicits comment on the concept of adopting a health- based emission limit (HBEL) for HCl, it \nstill proposes to implement a MACT floor standard for HCl  without providing details and an \nexplanation of why EPA  is reversing its 2004 determinations that HCl is a threshold pollutant \nand that a health -based  standard is appropriate, and that no HCl standard is needed at all . This is \na reversal of EPA\u2019s longstanding twenty -year finding established in the 2004 MACT standard \nand was not addressed in either the 2023 or the 2024 Proposed Rule s.8  \n \nIn the preamble of the 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA states that: \u201c In response to the 2017 \nquestionnaire, we received HCL emissions data that EPA did not have when we developed the 2004 NESHAP. Therefore, we are proposing a standard pursuant to CAA section 112(d) (2) and \n(d)(3), as described further in section IV.A.1 of this preamble.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 809. While these two sentences are each factually true, taken together without explanation, the y are misleading . \nThat is because they  imply cause and effect \u2014i.e. , that the reason EPA  is now promulgating \nMACT floor standards for HCl is because it obtained new emissions  information that justified \nsuch regulation that was  not avai lable in 2004. This is simply not the case. EPA had ample HCl \ninformation for its initial MACT rulemaking when it determined that: \n The results of the exposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HCl emissions from lime production facilities are well below the health threshold value. Additionally, the threshold values, for which the RfC and AEGL values were determined to be appropriate values, were not exceeded when considering conservative estimates of \nexposure resulting from lime kiln emissions as well as considering background exposures to HCl and therefore, represent an ample margin of safety. Furthermore, no signific ant or \nwidespread adverse environmental effects from HCl is anticipated. Therefore, under \nauthority of section 112(d)(4), we have determined that further control of HCl emissions from lime manufacturing plants is not necessary.  \n 67 Fed. Reg. 78,057 (December 10. 2002).  \n \nEPA has not identified any new data from the 2017 ICR that is so fundamentally different \nto justify  regulation of HCl from lime manufacturing plants. T o the contrary, EPA  affirmed the \nacceptability of risks from all HAPs, including HCl, as recently as 2020 and found, in fact, that \nrisks are much lower than it originally believed. 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020)  (\u201cWe are \nfinalizing our proposed determination that the risks are acceptable and that the current NESHAP [which excludes HCl controls] provides an ample margin of safety.\u201d)  (parenthetical added).  All \nthe data from the 2017 questionnaire on HCl was available to EPA when it performed the risk assessment that it used as the basis for its  2020 determination that risks are acceptable and that \nthe existing regulations provide an ample margin of safety.  \n \n8 See 69 Fed. Reg. at  398 (EPA states that \u201cunder the authority of section 112(d)(4) of the CAA, we have determined \nthat no further control is necessary because HCl is a \u2018\u2018health threshold pollutant\u201d).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 18  \nEPA  must  provide an explanation of its position, including the reversals and errors, on \nthe four HAPs (HCl, mercury, organics and D/F) at issue. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. v. State \nFarm , 463 U.S. 29, 49 (1983)  (\u201cWe have frequently reiterated that an agency must cogently \nexplain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner \u201d) (\u201c\u2026an agency changing its course \nby rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which \nmay be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.\u201d) Id.  at 42 . The failure of EPA \nto explain its reasoning for abandoning its previous legal and policy interpretations related to \nthese four HAPs is a clear violation of the Clean Air Act, which states that a  rulemaking \u201cshall \nbe accompanied by a statement of basis and purpose\u2026[which] shall include\u2026the major legal \ninterpretations and policy considerations underlying the proposed rule.\u201d  CAA \u00a7 307(d)(3), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a77607(d)(3).  \n \nIV. EPA SHOULD AUTHORIZE PLANT -WIDE EMISSIONS AVERAGING FOR \nALL HAPS COVERED BY THE RULE , INCLUDING O RGANIC HAPS  AND \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nIn its comments on the January 2023 Proposed Rule, NLA request ed that emissions \naveraging be incorporated into a final rule  for the newly regulated HAPs , to allow  lime plants to \nmore cost -effectively optimize controls to prevent excessive emissions across the entire fa cility.  \nNLA noted that in the 2004 Lime MACT, EPA permitted plant -wide averaging of PM emissions \n(with some limitations), explaining: \n \nWe believe that allowing averaging is appropriate here because of the identity of the units \n(kilns and coolers in all cases), and the emissions (same HAP in same type of emissions, since all emissions result from kilns and coolers). Averaged emissions unde r these \ncircumstances would, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source. The averaging \nprovisions are included in the final NESHAP as a result of the recommendations of the \nSmall Business Advocacy Panel convened as required by section 609(b) of the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and improves the compliance flexibility options for \nsmall businesses, which is the intent of the RFA.  \n 69 Fed. R eg. 401 ( Jan. 5, 2004) .  \n \nIn the 20 24 Proposed Rule, EPA has proposed to allow emissions averaging for HCl and \nmercury emissions, with some restrictions. NLA commends EPA for including this approach but  \nbelieves that the same logic supporting emissions averaging for HCl and Hg supports emissions \naveraging for all covered HAPs . \n \nFor HCl and mercury, with limitations based on  pounds of H AP per ton or million ( MM)  \nton of lime produced, and for lime kilns seeking to comply with the same numerical standard, \nNLA agrees that EPA should authorize the weighted average methodology currently available \nfor PM in the current Lime MACT ( 40 C.F.R.\u00a7 63.7111) to show compliance. As explained \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 19 further below, NLA believes EPA should also authorize emissions averaging for organic HAPs \nand for dioxins and furans.9 \n \nA. EPA  Should Not Impose a Penalty on Emissions Averaging \nEPA  should delete the provision that  penalizes  emissions averaging by imposing a more \nstringent standard on averaged emissions.  This provision is arbitrary and unsupported by the \nfacts . As noted repeatedly, EPA has found that risks are already acceptable with an ample margin \nof safety for all HAPs with no additional standards at all. Accordingly, there are no benefits to \npublic health or the environment commensurate with any additional costs or controls that would be incurred to meet the emissions averaging  \u201cpenalty.\u201d EPA should delete this requirement and \ncall for averaged emissions to meet the same standard (on average) as un -averaged emissions. As \nEPA said with respect to PM as noted above, \u201c Averaged emissions under these circumstances \nwould, thus, still reflect MACT for the affected source.\u201d Averaging should be encouraged, not \ndiscouraged, because it allows sources to use the most efficient methods available to meet the standards.  \n Simple mathematics prove s that incorporation of the proposed 10% penalty for those \nsources utilizing emissions averaging will be more restrictive than existing sources meeting the already proposed restrictive MACT floors for HCl and Hg at the unit level. Use of the emissions \naveraging alternative not only requires at least one kiln to operate below these new aggressive \nMACT floors, it then requires the unit to operate at an even more restrictive level for the averaging to be useful.  In other words, the inc orporation of a penalty for emissions averaging \nruns contrary to providing EPA\u2019s express purpose of providing additional compliance flexibility.\n10 \n EPA presumes that this option will provide reductions at lower cost on a unit -by-unit \nbasis.  Even if there will be some cost savings, this does not justify the imposition of a penalty for \naveraging. Operators may choose to average emissions for reasons that are not purely economic .  \nFor example, there can be operational or site constraint reasons that will prompt an operator to \nchoose averaging that are independent of cost.   \n As mentioned in these comments  and in prior submittals, there are still fundamental \ntechnical issues to be overcome for candidate controls to meet EPA\u2019s proposed aggressive standards before any arbitrary penalty is applied. As a result, EPA\u2019s proposal  for an averaging \npenalty  is essentially adding unsupported beyond- the-floor requirements . As has been pointed \nout repeatedly, the proposed limits already provide an ample margin of safety,  and no cost -\neffective beyond- the-floor controls are available. Thus, there is no environmental impact  being \nmitigated through an arbitrary penalty for those utilizing the emissions averaging option to demonstrate compliance . \n \n9 Accompanying these comments as Appendix A  is a \u201cblueline\u201d of the regulatory language that EPA included as a \nredline in the rulemaking docket. In this Appendix, NLA indicates suggested changes to the regulatory language \nreflect ing these comments.  EPA\u2019s changes remain in red, while the suggested NLA changes are in blue.  \n10 See 89 Fed. Reg. 28 9097.  \u201c We are proposing the emissions averaging compliance alternative for  \nexisting sources because we expect that it will result in a greater level of emissions reduction than the unit -by-unit \nMACT floor limits at a lower cost per pound of pollutant removed, while also providing compliance flexibility.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 20  \nTherefore, EPA should not incorporate any penalty on the emissions limits for those \nchoosing emissions averaging under this rulemaking. Furthermore, the Lime MACT already \nincludes emissions averaging for PM which has worked well for over 20 years, and no such penalty was applied.  \n \nB. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging for Organics and Dioxins and \nFurans  \nEPA should allow for emissions averaging for organics and for dioxins and furans. The \nstandards  for these two categories of HAPs  are extremely  low ( in the parts -per-million or parts -\nper-billion ), and whether such pollutants are detected in a stack test are often dependent on \nrandom chance-- whether such molecules happen to strike the probe during that test. Members \nhave reported to NLA that similar kilns of the same  size and  type, using the same limestone \nfeedstock and the same fuel, often have significantly  different oHAP or D/F test results  even for \nidentical kilns . Allowing averaging of these two categories of pollutants would help to alleviate \nthis issue and provide compliance flexibility to sources , and because EPA has found that lime \nindustry emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safely even in the absence of controls, \nno harm to human health and the environment would result from allowing such averaging.  \n While the limits for organics and D/F are concentration- based (as opposed to being based \non production rates as with HCl and mercury), there is no technical or legal obstacle to the \ndevelopment of appropriate emissions a veraging for these HAPs as well  (and they should be \ndeveloped without a penalty , as explained above ). \n \nA simple and appropriate approach for these HAPs would include  the following \nrequirements and methodology, and should be added to \u00a763.7112 (see NLA \u201cblueline, \u201d \nAppendix A ): \n \n\u2022 Step 1:  Complete performance tests and collect oHAP and D/F data in the units of the \nemissions limitations, respectively.  The measurement units are parts  per million, dry \nbasis and by volume (ppmdv) for oHAP and nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (ng/dscm) for D/F, both corrected to 7% O\n2 in the exhaust gas stream. \n\u2022 Step 2:  Based on the average flowrate for each kiln and lime cooler from the performance test, compute a flowrate weighted emissions average for comparison to the applicable limitation.  \n \nThe following is an illustration of how this would work in practice on a two - kiln emissions \naverage:  \n \n\u2022 Kiln 1  \no C\nK1 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.05 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK1 = Measured airflow = 25,000 dscm in this example  \n\u2022 Kiln 2   \no CK2 = Measured concentration for D/F = 0.02 mg/dscm in this example  \no FK2 = Measured airflow = 50,000 dscm in this example  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 21 \u2022 Emissions Averaging Calculation:  \no Eavg = (C K1 x F K1)/(F K1 + F K2)+ (C K2 x F K2)/(F K1 + F K2) \no Eavg = (0.05 x 25,000)/(25,000+50,000)+ (0.02 x 50,000/(25,000+50,000)  \no Eavg = 0.03 ng/dscm which is less than the proposed limit of 0.037 ng/dscm  \n \nIn terms of necessary recordkeeping and reporting for the emissions average, like HCl \nand Hg, an annual average recordkeeping should be incorporated when this compliance \nalternative is utilized. In place of tons of lime produced, the rule should provide that lime operators can either: 1) record total kiln gas flowrate from each unit in the average during each calendar month; or 2) develop a dscm/ton of stone feed from the performance test used in the emissions average and lime produced each month to  demonst rate compliance with the emissions \naverages for these two pollutants.\n11 Suggested rule language is below:  \n \nThe emissions average for total organic HAP or D/F shall be computed as follows:  \n \n(a) The concentration of total organic HAP or  dioxins/furans shall be correct to 7 percent \noxygen using equation 5 of this section for lime kilns included in the emissions average.  \n(b) From the respective performance tests, obtain the flowrate in units of dscm for each kiln in the average.  \n(c) Using the following equation, Equation [X], compute the emissions average concentration for comparison to the emissions limitation:  \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 =\ufffd (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\u2217\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36)/(\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39)\n\u221e\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b=1  \n \n\u2022 Eavg = Emission average in units of D/F in ng/dscm, 7% O 2 or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% \nO2 \n\u2022 CKi = Measured concentration for D/F in ng/dscm or total oHAPs ppmdv, 7% O 2 for a \nlime kiln  \n\u2022 FKi = Measured exhaust gas in units of dscm for a lime kiln \n\u2022 FKt = Total combined measured airflow in units of dscm for all lime kilns in the \nemissions average  \n \n \nC. EPA Should Allow Emissions Averaging Between New and Existing Kilns  \nFor particulate matter (PM), EPA allow s lime plants to average emissions between new \nand existing kilns, as explained below  in the Proposed Rule preamble : \n \nIf the lime manufacturing plant has both new and existing kilns and coolers, then   \nthe emission limit would be an average of the existing and new kiln PM emissions \nlimits, weighted by the annual actual production rates of the individual kilns, except that no new kiln may exceed the PM emission level of 0.10 lb/tsf. \n \n11 Given that lime kiln and cooler exhaust gas flows are proportional to decarbonization of limestone (and related \nfuel combustion to support calcination), lime production and exhaust gas flows are proportional by nature.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 22  \n89 Fed. Reg. 9090.  \n \nThe Proposed Rule does not permit averaging between new and existing kilns for HCl \nand mercury, even for kilns of the same type. EPA should allow such averaging for all HAPs , as \nit did for PM, so long as the new kiln does not exceed the new kiln standard. \n \nD. EPA  Should Not Require a Separate Emissions Averaging Plan  or Pre-\nApproval for Emission Averaging \nEPA\u2019s new proposal includes a requirement that sources using the option for emissions \naveraging to prepare and submit an emissions  averaging plan for approval before emissions \naveraging can begin. 12 This requirement is unnecessary and unduly burdensome. L ime \nproducers subject to this rule are already required to prepare an OM&M Plan and various \nperformance test protocol and notification documents as part of this regulation.  With this variety \nof administrative documents in place, EPA should simply allow li me producers to document the \nemissions averaging plan requirements in their OM&M Plan , without preparing a separate plan, \nand without submitting it for pre -approval. Inclusion of a pre -approval process injects a level of \ncomplexity and need for official action that is excessive, given the fact that emissions from the industry are already so low that risks are acceptable with an ample margin of safety without any new standards.  \n E. EPA Should Allow for Averaging Across HCl Subcategories, Including \nPlant -Wide Averaging \nAs previously discussed, a regulatory option that allow s emissions averaging provides \ncompliance flexibility for those sources  that opt to use averaging . However, this option can be \nfurther enhanced by allowing existing kilns, regardless of their subcategories, to be averaged \nacross a single plant. This would only apply to HCl, because EPA has only proposed \nsubcategories for HCl. It would also be unnecessary if EPA establishes a health -based emission \nlimit (HBEL) for HCl.  \n If EPA continues to set subcategories for HCl, NLA suggests that the final rule include a \nplant -wide, all kiln, averaging alternative. This regulatory approach can be accomplished by \nestablishing a site -wide limit as follows:  \n Establish a sitewide allowable HCl emissions limit by the following steps:  \n \n1. Determine the annual production capacity of lime by subcategory type for the \nfacility.  \n2. Multiply the sitewide total production capacity by lime type times the respective \nsubcategory emissions limit.  \n3. The resulting value will establish the sitewide allowable HCl limitation in units of tons per year.  \n \n \n12 \u00a763.7114(c)(2) , Docket ID: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0200.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 23 Compliance with the annual HCl limit would be demonstrated by:  \n \n1. Multiplying the lime production for each month by lime type times the respective \nHCl limit (or most recent HCl performance test value as available) to compute the tons of HCl emitted during the month. \n2. Add this result to the prior 11 calendar month period to compute a 12- month total \nHCl actual emissions level which is then compared to the site -wide allowable HCl \nlimit.  \n \nThis form of a limitation is comparable in form to an  HBEL though it is more restrictive because \nthe sitewide HCl limit would be based on the facility\u2019s Potential to Emit ( PTE) HCl using the \nHCl limits in the Proposed Rule.\n13 \n \nV. EPA CORRECTLY PROPOSED TO SET MONITORING REQIREMENTS AS \nFIVE -YEAR STACK TESTING  AND PARAMETRIC MONITORING  \n NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s proposal to establish 5- year stack testing and parametric \nmonitoring as the monitoring requirements for emissions standards under the Proposed Rule.\n14 \nThis is consistent with the existing requirements for PM for the lime industry , and, as EPA notes, \nthe parametric monitoring will ensure continuous compliance. Imposing more rigorous and costly monitoring requirements would not be justified in this case, given the low emissions of HAPs generally, and EPA\u2019s risk assessment showing that risks are acceptable with an ample \nmargin of safety even without additional controls. \n \nVI. NLA SUPPORTS EPA\u2019s  PROPOSED 3- YEAR COMPLIANCE PERIOD, BUT \nEPA  SHOULD EXERCISE ITS AUTHORI TY TO ALLOW  AN ADDIT IONAL \nYEAR THROUGH PERMITTING FOR THE INSTALLATION OF NEW CONTROLS   \n Given the extensive requirements for study, design, permitting and construction that lime \nplants would be subject to under the Proposed Rule, the need for a 3-year compliance period is fully justified to adequately test, engineer, design, and retrofit  lime plant systems,  and then \ndemonstrate compliance with the applicable standards . Any period less than 3 years would \njeopardize the industry\u2019s ability  to comply with the proposed standard. \n In addition, EPA should state  in the preamble to the final rule that it encourages s tate \npermitting authorities (or EPA if it is  the regulatory authority) to allow lime manufacturing \nplants an additional year to install new controls for this rule . The statute expressly allows  this \noption under these circumstances : \n The Administrator  (or a  State  \nwith a program approved under subchapter V) may issue a \npermit that grants an extension permitting an existing source  up to 1 additional year to \ncomply with standards under subsection (d) if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls.   \n \n13 This suggested rule language is not included in the NLA blueline, which rather reflects an HBEL for HCl.  \n14 NLA suggests some adjustments to the parametric monitoring requirements later in these comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 24 42 USC \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(B).  \n \nProviding an additional year through permitting will be necessary  given that the entire \nlime industry will be installing new controls simultaneously and will face difficulties with \nensuring that a limited number of vendors are able to install controls on dozens of lime kilns across the nation, particularly given recent supply chain shortages and issues. Also, given EPA\u2019s \ndetermination that emissions from lime kilns are already acceptable with an ample margin of \nsafety, allowing an extra year for installatio n of controls will not harm public health or the \nenvironment. \n \nVII. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THE USE OF \u201cNEW\u201d AND \u201cEXISTING\u201d KILNS  \n EPA should also clarify its use of \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cexisting\u201d kilns in the Proposed Rule. The \ncurrent NESHAP rule defines a new lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one for which \nconstruction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002. It also defines an existing lime kiln (and its associated cooler), as one that does not meet the definition of a new kiln.  \n \nIn the 2024 Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n The EPA is including definitions of the terms \u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 as \nrelated to the requirements of this supplemental proposal and to clearly indicate that a \n\u2018\u2018new source\u2019\u2019 in reference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal i s any \napplicable source constructed after January 5, 2023, and an \u2018\u2018existing source\u2019\u2019 in \nreference to the requirements of this supplemental proposal is any applicable source \nconstructed before January 5, 2023. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9097. NLA has identified two problems with this. First, there is no language in the docket redline with definitions as described in the paragraph above. (This emphasizes the importance of including proposed rule language in the Federal Register  notice itself.) \nAppropriate language must be added to the final rule.   Second, NLA does not agree that the relevant date for what constitutes an existing kiln  or \na new kiln should be January 5, 2023. The current February 9, 2024, Proposed Rule sets  new \nstandards for the first time for all four HAPs and  was carried out in response to the Small \nBusiness review panel described above. If the date for determining if a kiln is \u201cnew\u201d is to be \nbased on the proposed rule date, the relevant date should be February 9, 2024.  \n \nAccordingly, EPA should revise the Proposed Rule  language to read as follows (changes \nmarked in red) : \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 25 \u00a763.7082  What parts of  my plant  does this  subpart cover?  \n(a) This subpart  applies  to each existing  or new lime kiln(s)  and their associated  \ncooler(s), and processed stone handling (PSH) operations system(s) located at an LMP \nthat is a major source.  \n(b) A new lime kiln is a lime kiln, and (if applicable)  its associated  lime cooler,  for \nwhich construction or reconstruction began after December 20, 2002, if you met the \napplicability criteria in \u00a763.7081 at the time you began construction or reconstruction, except that with respect to emissions standards added [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE], \na new lime kiln is a lime kiln for which construction or reconstruction began after  \nFebruary 9, 2024.  \n \n \n NLA believes that this change will make it appropriately clear that when \u201cnew\u201d \nand \u201cexisting\u201d are used elsewhere in the rule language, they refer either to the PM standards or to the additional standards being added in this rule. (Thus, for example, a kil n could be \n\u201cnew\u201d for purposes of PM, but \u201cexisting\u201d for purposes of the additional HAPs.)  \n  In addition, the word \u201cinitially\u201d should be added before the phrase \u201cstart up ,\u201d and \nthe word \u201cinitial\u201d should be added before the  word \u201cstartup ,\u201d in section s 63.7083(a)(1 ) and \n(2), 63.7083(c) , 63.7083(e)(1) , 63.7110(f) , and 63.7130(b)  and (c) , to make clear that the \nrequirements in those sections apply to initial startup, not to each time a kiln is started up. This will avoid confusion with other provisions relating to recurring periods of startup and shutdown. \n \nVIII.  THE RULE LANGUAGE ON COMPLIANCE PERIOD SHOULD BE CORRECTED  While EPA\u2019s preamble clearly states that a 3 -year compliance period is intended for \nexisting sources, language in Section  63.7083( h)(1) in the redline rule language in the docket \nseems to indicate that the compliance period is only 180 days. The preamble states:  \n For all affected sources that commence construction or reconstruction on or before January 5, 2023, we are proposing to require compliance with the proposed standards within 3 years after the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later). For all affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after  \nJanuary 5, 2023, we are proposing that owners or operators comply with the provisions \nby the effective date of the final rule (or upon startup, whichever is later).  \n 8 Fed. Reg. 9098. NLA understands \u201c affected sources that commence construction on or before \nJanuary 5, 2023\u201d to mean \u201cexisting sources\u201d with respect to the new standards proposed in this rule, and that these sources are intended to have three years from the date of the final rule to \ncome into compliance.   \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 26  However, the redline proposed regulatory language in the docket is inconsistent with the \npreamble language and refers to 180 days rather than 3 years. There is also a discrepancy \nbetween the preamble and the redline rule language on whether the relevant \u201co n or before date\u201d \nis Jan. 5, 2023, or the date of the final rule. NLA believes that EPA should refer to February 9, \n2024, rather than the 2023 date, because, as noted above, EPA has made significant substantive changes to the rule . Indeed, it is possible that a source could have begun and completed \nreconstruction of a kiln between January of 2023 and February of 2024, without knowing what \nthe relevant requirements would be. (Section 112(a)(2) precludes use of the final rule date for \ndefining new vs. existing kilns.)   \n New section 67.7083( h)(1) in the EPA redline document reads:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before  \n[INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], \nthen the compliance date for the revised requirements promulgated on [INSERT DATE \nOF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 180 \nDAYS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATI ON IN THE FEDERAL \nREGISTER].  \n \nThis language should be revised to read:  \n \nIf your affected source commenced construction or reconstruction on or before \nFebruary 9, 2024, then the compliance date for the revised requirements \npromulgated on [INSERT DATE OF FINAL RULE PUBLICATION IN THE \nFEDERAL REGISTER] is [INSERT 3 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF FINAL \nRULE PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\n  \n \nNote: EP A\u2019s proposed revisions to \u00a77083 means tha t numerous references to \u00a77083(e) in the rule \nlanguage will need to be changed to \u00a77083(g). See the NLA blueline for these changes.  \n IX. THE RULE SHOULD ONLY APPLY PM STANDARDS TO COOLERS  \nAs currently written, the Proposed Rule would apply standards for HAPs other than PM \nto kilns and \u201cassociated coolers.\u201d For the reasons below, this should be changed, and the rule should apply only PM standards to coolers. Definitional language should also be added to make this clear.  \n In a lime plant, limestone is calcined in a heated kiln, and it is the emissions  exiting in \nexhaust from the kiln that contain the HAPs  address ed in this regulation \u2014HCl, mercury, organic \nHAPs, and dioxins/and furans. When the lime product is made, it leaves the kiln and is transferred to a cooler, a large vessel in which the lime product is cooled by the introduction of ambient air (not gases from the kiln). Pulling in ambient air to the cooler by means of a fan may result in the presence of dust or particulate matter in the cooler exhaust. Th is is why  EPA \nestablished PM standards applicable to coolers in the original lime rule.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 27  \nThis distinction is not important when the air from the cooler vents to the same stack as \ngases from the kiln, because those kilns will have to meet all the HAP standards at the stack. However, in some cases cooler exhaust  vents separately and is sent to a separate stack from kiln \ngases . In those cases, it is only necessary to test for PM at those stacks , because the other HAPs \nwill not be present.  \n Furthermore, as explained in the separate comments filed by NLA members Lhoist, \napplying the oH AP standards to separately vented coolers would result in anomalous results. As \nLhoist (which operates such a cooler) explains: \n In addition, the methodology used to convert a pollutant to a standard O\n2 concentration is \nmeant to be utilized in combustion sources.  Applying this same methodology to a source that utilizes ambient O\n2 results in nonsensical emission rates.  For example, consider a \nsituation from a lime cooler, where no oHAP\u2019s were measured.  Per the proposed rule, the source must report the total oHAP emission rate using the method detection limit.  The following equation demonstrates how a non- detect measurement for oHA P in a lime \ncooler becomes a significant emission rate when converting this to a measurement at 7% O\n2.  \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  @ 7% \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422=\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c  \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u2212\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 2\ufffd where,  \n \nEoHAP @ 7% O2 = Total oHAP concentration in ppmvd @ 7% O 2 \nCoHAP = Total oHAP concentration at the measured oxygen concentration \nO2 = Measured oxygen concentration at the source \n \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd20.9\u22127\n20.9\u221220.85\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65  \ufffd13.9\n0.05\ufffd= 0. 56 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 278 =155 .7 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d @ 7%  \ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422 \n \nA total oHAP measurement that started as a non -detectable emission rate at an O 2 \nconcentration of 20.85% results in a reported total emission rate of 155.7 ppmvd @ 7% O\n2.  At this emission rate, an operator would be required to install an add-on pollution \ncontrol device (likely an RTO) for an emission rate that is nonexistent.    \n Under the rule as written, this absurd result would occur even if no oHAPs were detected at the cooler at all, because the rule requires use of the MDL when no oHAPs are detected. (This is another reason EPA should use 0 for non- detects) . \n \nNLA suggests that this issue be addressed by modifying the definition of \u201c Lime Cooler \u201d \nin \u00a763.7143 as follows: \n \nLime cooler means the device external to the lime kiln (or part of the lime kiln itself) used to \nreduce the temperature of the lime produced by the kiln. For the purposes of this regulation, a cooler is associated with a lime kiln with respect to particulate matter (PM) emissions, but is not associated with a lime kiln for the purposes of standards for additional air pollutants added \nto the regulation on [ADD DATE OF FINAL RULE].  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 28  \nIn addition, references to coolers should be removed from \u00a763.7112(o), and Table 1, \nLines 13, 14, 15, and 16. In Table 4, Line 1, the term PM should be restored to the parenthetical, \nbecause only PM emissions from separate coolers need to be summed with kiln emissions.  X. EPA SHOULD CLARIFY THAT NOT ALL PERFORMANCE TESTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PERFORMED IN THE SAME SCHEDULE  \n \n As written, \u00a763.7112 could be read to require that performance tests for all HAPs, \nincluding PM, be performed at the same time. EPA should clarify that this is not required. \nSources may have undertaken PM performance tests less than 5 years before the issuance of the final rule governing additional HAPs, and thus testing for PM could be on a different 5-year schedule than testing for the additional HAPs. In addition, sources may for practical reasons perform testing of the additional HAPs on varying schedules (although, of course, they would all have to be performed within the required period). NLA suggests adding the following language to \u00a763.7112(b) to clarify this point:  \nPerformance tests for the emission standards promulgated in this rule, including PM \nemission standards and emissions standards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at \nthe same time . \n XI. EPA SHOULD EXPRESS STANDARDS IN TERMS OF \u201cLIME PRODUCED,\u201d NOT \u201cSTONE PRODUCED.\u201d  \n \nIn the definitions section of the Proposed Rule redline (\u00a763.7143) , EPA includes the \nfollowing:  \nStone produced refers to the production of limestone from the lime kiln consisting of high calcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nSubsequently, the term \u201cstone produced\u201d is used in several places in the rule language, while in other places (such as Tables 1 and 9), the term \u201clime produced\u201d is used. EPA should consistently use the term \u201clime produced\u201d to refer to quicklime and dolomitic lime produced in lime kilns. Limestone is the stone feedstock used to make lime (which is why some other standards a re \nbased on \u201cstone feed.\u201d) The lime products are not limestone, or stone at all. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of  calcium carbon ate and/or calcium -magnesium \ncarbonate, while lime is calcium oxide  or calcium -magnesium oxide, a different compound and \nstructure entirely .  \n \nUsing the term \u201cstone\u201d for this material is likely to create confusion.  Using the term \n\u201clime\u201d to refer to lime products will be consistent with industry practice, and with terminology used by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n15 Accordingly, the definition of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be \ndeleted  from \u00a763.7143, and replaced with: \n \n \n15 See, e.g., https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024- lime.pdf . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 29 Lime produced  refers to the production of lime products produced from the lime kiln \nconsisting of high calcium quicklime, dolomitic quicklime, and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n \nThe term \u201cstone produced\u201d should be replaced with \u2018lime produced\u201d where the term \nappears elsewhere in the rule language.  The term appears in \u00a7\u00a7 63.7114 (c)(2)(i), 63.7121(g)(3) , \nand 63.7143. The term also appears in several locations in the Proposed Rule preamble, \nincluding in Tables 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, and in text. These are inconsistent with the tables in the redline (which properly refer to \u201clime produced\u201d). All instances of \u201cstone produced\u201d should be changed to \u201clime produced\u201d if the reference is to lime product produced at the kiln. (Note further that \u201cquicklime\u201d is typically spelled as a single word with no spaces .) \n XII. EPA PROPERLY DECLINES TO PROPOSE BEYOND- THE -FLOOR \nSTANDARDS FOR EMISSIONS IN THE PROPOSED RULE  \n \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA correctly proposes not to set beyond- the-floor standards \nfor any of the covered HAPs.\n16  \n \nEPA is obligated  to consider  costs with respect to beyond- the-floor controls, as it is \ndirected to do in Clean Air Act section 112(d). A vital element in the analysis of the cost-\neffectiveness of an emissions standard  is whether it will significantly reduce the risk imposed by \nthe emissions to be controlled. In the case at hand, as recounted elsewhere in these comments, EPA performed a comprehensive risk assessment on all major sources in the lime industry in the 2020 RTR proceeding and determined that risks are acceptable at all major sources with an ample margin of safety  for all affected HAPs  even with no additional controls for at all . \nAccordingly, it cannot be cost -effective to impose additional costs on any existing source \nbecause the lack of a health or environmental benefit does not justify any new costs.  \n Imposing beyond -the-floor standards would impose unnecessary additional costs on \nsources. To  comply with any emissions standard, sources must calibrate pollution control devices \nto achieve the standard, with an appropriate margin of error to prevent violations. For example, when the treatment technology EPA identifies for mercury control is activated carbon injection (ACI), the rate of injection \u2014and thus the cost of carbon\u2014will directly relate to the emissions \nstandard. A lower standard means more carbon injected, and higher costs. Furthermore, existing \nplant configurations  may not be able to accept higher rates of ACI due to operational constraints , \nfurther increasing costs . Similar additional costs would be incurred for other HAPs as well if \nlower standard s were set. These additional costs cannot be justified by any consideration of costs \ncompared to risks because EPA already determined that the risks do not justify any additional controls at all.  \n In sum, NLA strongly supports EPA\u2019s decision  not to set beyond- the-floor standards in \nthe Proposed Rule . \n \n \n16 In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed to set beyond -the-floor emission standards for mercury \nemissions from existing sources for most lime plants, and for both existing and new sources for sources making \ndead -burned dolomitic lime.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 30 ISSUES RELATING TO SPECIFIC STANDARDS  \n \nHCL  \n XIII.  EPA SHOULD REGULATE HCL BY MEANS OF  A HEALTH -BASED \nSTANDARD IN THIS RULEMAKING UNDER CLEAN AIR ACT SECTION \n112(D)(4)  \n \nAs noted above, EPA determined that HCl was a threshold pollutant when it issued the \nMACT standard for lime manufacturing in 2004. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA has reaffirmed  \nthat HCl is a threshold pollutant, and that a health -based standard under Clean Air Act Section \n112(d)(1) would be justified for the lime industry. While EPA does not propose to set such a \nstandard, it spells out the justification for such a standard, indicates what the standard would be, \nand requests comment on setting such a standar d. Thus , EPA can choose to set a health -based \nstandard in the final rule, and it should do so, for the reasons set out below.  \n \nA. EPA C arefully E valuated the S cientific D ata and C oncluded that HCl Was a \nThreshold P ollutant in the Original L ime MACT S tandard in 2004 and T hat \nFinding Was, and I s, Correct  \n \n The Clean Air Act allows EPA to use a health threshold when issuing emission standards \nunder s ection 112(d) for pollutants for which a health threshold has been established. CAA \u00a7 \n112(d)(4); 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(d)(4). Such a health- based standard must include an \u201cample margin \nof safety.\u201d Id. In its 112(d) MACT standard for lime manufacturing, EPA concluded that HCl \nwas a threshold pollutant, considering several factors such as \u201cevidence and classification of \ncarcinogenic risk and evidence of non -carcinogenic effects.\u201d 67 Fed. Reg. at 78054- 55.17 \n \nNLA conducted a risk assessment to determine whether emissions of HCl from lime kilns \nat baseline levels resulted in exposures below threshold values for HCl. EPA reviewed NLA\u2019s \nrisk assessment report and concluded that it used reasonable and conservative methodology, was \nconsistent with EPA methodology and practice, and reached a reasonable conclusion that current \nlevels of HCl emissions from lime kilns would be well under the threshold levels of concern for human receptors. Id.  at 78055. To aid in its ana lysis, EPA reproduced several of NLA\u2019s \nmodeling analyses, performing its own analyses for selected facilities having the highest \npotential for risk to the surrounding community, and ultimately affirmed  NLA\u2019s assessment.  \n \nIt is helpful to put these low risks in perspective. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) is the ratio \nof exposure (or modeled concentration) to the health reference value or threshold level ( i.e., \nreference concentration ( RfC) or acute exposure guidance level ( AEGL) ). HQ values less than \n\u201c1\u201d indicate that exposures are below the health reference value or threshold level and are likely \nto be without appreciable risk of adverse effect in the exposed population. 67 Fed. Reg. 78,055-\n \n17 In the preamble to the proposed lime  MACT standard  in 2002 , EPA noted that  it had included a detailed \ndiscussion of factors it considers in deciding whether a pollutant should be categorized as a health threshold \npollutant  in its proposed rule titled:  National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants; Proposed Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants From Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-\nAlone Semichemical Pulp Mills . 63 Fed. Reg. 18, 766 (April 15, 1998).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 31 56 (Dec. 20, 2002). Based on a n HCl risk assessment of all lime kilns in the industry, EPA felt \nconfident that exposures to HCl emissions from lime manufacturing facilities are unlikely to ever \nexceed an HQ of 0.2. Id.  at 78,056. In other words, risks from HCl emissions from lime plants \nhave a more than adequate \u201cam ple margin of safety\u201d because they are expected  to be \nsignificantly  lower than  the level at which there would likely be no appreciable risk  (i.e., an HQ \nof 1.0) .  \n \nEPA\u2019s conclusions were validated in its RTR review. In 2019, as part of the residual risk \nreview, EPA performed  a comprehensive risk assessment for all 35 operating lime plants that are \nmajor sourc es of HAP . The maximum chronic noncancer hazard index (HI) for the lime \nmanufacturing source category was  estimated by EPA to be only 0.04 based on actual emission \nof HCl, nickel compounds, and acrolein emitted f rom lime kiln and cooler exhaust , and 0.05 \nbased on allowable emissions, with HCl, nickel compounds, ac rolein, and formaldehyde \nemissions as primary risk drivers , 85 Fed. Reg. 44,964 (July 24, 2020). In other words, when \nEPA did its follow -up residual risk assessment  using representative data under actual and \nallowable emissions scenarios , it found that the chronic risks from all noncancer HAP (including, \nbut not limited to HCl) were much  lower than the risks estimated in 2002, and even  further from \nan HQ of 1.0. This analysis proves that EPA was correct in determining that risks from \nuncontrolled emissions of HCl are acceptable wit h an ample margin of safety.  \n \nEPA also evaluated whether HCl emissions would cause any significant or widespread \nadverse environmental effects to wildlife, aquatic life, or other natural resources, ultimately \nconcluding, \u201cwe do not anticipate any adverse ecological effects from HCl.\u201d Id.  at 78057.  \n Putting all this evidence together, EPA correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he results of the \nexposure assessment showed that exposure levels to baseline HC l emissions from lime \nproduction facilities are well below the health threshold value.\u201d Id.  EPA concluded that HCl was \na threshold pollutant and that the risks from emissions of HCl from lime manufacturing facilities were below such threshold value. No party challenged this conclusion, and the time for making \nany such challenge has long since pa ssed. See CAA \u00a7 307(b)(1\n), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607 (b)(1).  \nAccordingly, that conclusion is the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and must be respected in this rulemaking proceeding.\n18 \n In its recent RTR rule for lime manufacturing facilities, EPA hired an outside contractor \nto conduct  a new comprehensive risk assessment for all hazardous air pollutants (including HCl). \nThis new analysis found that the risks of lime manufacturing under the current MACT standard (which contains no HCl standard at all, let alone a health -based standard) w ere \u201cacceptable\u201d and \nthat the \u201ccurrent NESHAP provides an ample margin of safety to protect public health.\u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960. EPA\u2019s RTR fact sheet describing the conclusions of the risk assessment states that the \u201cmaximum individual cancer risk . . . for inhalation for the source category is estimated to be 1-in-1 million,\u201d and that this data supported the conclusion that risks from lime manufacturing \n \n18 As noted above, in 2004, after EPA decided that HCl was a threshold pollutant entitled to a health- based standard \nunder 112(d)(4), EPA ultimately determined that the risks were so low that no standard was justified. If EPA had set \na health -based standard\u2014e ven a very high one that all sources would have met \u2014there could be no claim now that \nEPA failed to adequately address HCl. For EPA to now set a non- health -based standard without explanation would \nbe arbitrary and capricious and contrary to its own prior decisions.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 32 source category were acceptable and safe. EPA, Fact Sheet: Proposed Amendments to Air Toxics \nStandards for Lime Manufacturing Plants , June, 2020.19 As such, because EPA concluded that \nthere are no health or safety risks under the current lime NESHAP, if EPA issues any standard at all, it should issue a health -based standard for HCl, as it would more than adequately protect the \npublic and is based on the best available science.  \n \nEPA itself recently concluded that HCl is not a carcinogen. On November 18, 2021, EPA \nissued a final RTR for the flexible polyurethane foam fabrication operations industry. National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Flexible Polyurethane Foam Fabrication \nOperations Residual Risk and Technology Review and Flexible Polyurethane Foam Production and \nFabrication Area Source Technology Review, 86 Fed. Reg. 64385 (Nov. 18, 2021). These facilities emit HCl, and EPA promulgated standards for HCl, but EPA specifically concluded that \u201cno carcinogens are emitted by this category.\u201d 86 Fed. Reg. 64391-92.  \n \nSeveral other RTRs have confirmed that EPA\u2019s longstanding position is that HCl is not a \ncarcinogen. See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Asphalt Processing and \nAsphalt Roofing Manufacturing Residual Risk and Technology Review , 85 Fed. Reg. 14526, 14535 \n(Mar. 12, 2020) (citing to the International Agency for Research on Cancer\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity  to humans\u201d); National Emission Standards for Hazardous \nAir Pollutants: Hydrochloric Acid Production Residual Risk and Technology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 20855, 20861 (Apr. 15, 2020) (\u201c[t]he results of the inhalation cancer risk assessment \u2026 indicate \nthere is no quantifiable cancer risk posed by the source category\u2026HCl is not classifiable as a human carcinogen\u201d). \n \nIn the absence of new information or new law, for EPA to reverse its prior decision that \nHCl is a threshold pollutant for the lime industry would be arbitrary and capricious. As explained below, the recent Sierra Club decision in the brick/clay MACT rule does not provide any such new information or law. As noted above, newer information (including the Ramboll report), only serves to strengthen the determination that HCl is a threshold pollutant. Thus, EPA may not reverse its prior decision on this topic and should promulgate a health-based standard for HCl. \n B. EPA is N ot Constrained by the B rick/ Clay Sierra Club  MACT C ase because \nLime M anufacturing I s Clearly D istinguishable from T hat C ase in A ll Its \nKey Factual/T echnical/ Legal C onclusions  \n In 2018, the Sierra Club and others challenged EPA\u2019s use of a health- based standard for \nHCl in the MACT standard for the brick/clay industry. Sierra Club v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. \n2018). Although the court sided with the Sierra Club in the case, the court did not say that EPA cannot issue a health -based  standard for HCl. Rather t he court remanded  EPA\u2019s standard for \nfurther consideration based on the three reasons discussed below. Critically, given current knowledge on HCl and the facts in the lime industry, none of these reasons is either relevant today, or can be used to deny use of a health-based standard for HCl for the lime manufacturing RTR.   \n \n19 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020 -06/documents/lime_manufacturing_rtr_final_fs.pdf   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 33 First, the court held that EPA had not met the s ection 112(d)(4) requirement that a health \nthreshold be \u201cestablished.\u201d Id. at 10 -11. EPA had reviewed toxicity assessments in several \ndatabases and opinions from scientific bodies and found that none classified HCl as carcinogenic \nor \u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic.\u201d Id. However, the court held that EPA had not provided a sufficient record to determine that there was no cancer risk. EPA, the court stated, noted that \u201clittle research\u201d had been conducted on carcinogenicity of HCl. Ultimately, the court \ncharacterized EPA as relying on the \u201clack of any significant studies.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \nTherefore, the court held that EPA acted unreasonably by concluding that it is \u201cestablished\u201d that \nHCl poses no cancer risk. Id.  \n The overwhelming scientific consensus regarding the non- carcinogenicity of HCl is \nwidely accepted and compels the conclusion that HCl does not cause cancer. To aid in \npromulgation of the revised RTR, NLA engaged toxicology experts from the firm Ramboll to \nprepare a report on the carcinogenicity of HCl, which NLA provided to EPA on June 29, 2021 (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0073) . In contrast to the insufficient record that served as the basis \nfor the Sierra Club court\u2019s holding, Ramboll concluded that \u201cHCl has not  been identified as a \ncarcinogen, either by authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own search of the scientific literature, \ndespite its long history of use.\u201d Ramboll, \u201c Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Hydrochloric \nAcid (HCl) and HCl Mist ,\u201d (June 11, 2021) (\u201cRamboll Report\u201d). Ramboll stated:  \n \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and \nepidemiological studies in exposed workers. Several authoritative groups \n(including the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for \nResearch on Cancer [IARC], the Internation al Programme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the international Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development [OECD]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of these groups have concluded that \nHCl is a carcinogen. Oth er authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology \nProgram) have chosen not to evaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is unlikely based on its physical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association with cancer.  \n  \u2026 \nIn addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramboll did a \nseries of additional literature searches for any new studies which might \nindicate HCl is a carcinogen. We employed several search strategies to \nmake sure we uncovered any new scienti fic evidence that may not have \nbeen considered by previous assessments. Despite this broad search, we \nidentified only six additional publications. This newer evidence is \nconsistent with the earlier body of scientific evidence. In addition to direct \nstudies  of cancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence \nin the form of genotoxicity studies or potential to induce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 34 Ramboll Report, Executive Summary. These conclusions satisfy the requirements of the Sierra \nClub decision, and thus, for purposes of the lime manufacturing RTR revisions, HCl should be \nconsidered a health threshold pollutant.  \n  In response to the new Proposed Rule, a t NLA\u2019s request Ramboll has performed a further \nliterature review for any new studies relating to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl. (See \nSecond Ramboll Report, Appendix B  to these comments). Ramboll identified three additional \nrelevant studies, but analysis of those studies did not change Ramboll\u2019s conclusion that HCl is \nnot a human carcinogen. (See below for further discussion of the Second Ramboll Report)  \n \nThe second basis for the Sierra Club court\u2019s rejection of EPA\u2019s characterization of HCl \nas a threshold pollutant was the court\u2019s conclusion that EPA used only a single -low confidence, \nlow-quality risk assessment in its review, and that EPA did not use a more stringent California \nEPA (\u201cCalEPA \u201d) reference concentration for HCl that does not pose a health risk. 895 F.3d at \n12. This concern does not apply to the lime RTR. The lime RTR risk assessment performed by EPA included multiple, robust dose -response asse ssments, including CalEPA chronic and acute \ninhalation reference exposure levels (\u201cRELS\u201d) \n20 21 Even using the more conservative CalEPA \nRELs for HCl, t he EPA risk assessment found no unacceptable human health risk due to chronic \nor acute inhalation exposure.  \n Use of the CalEPA REL in the RTR risk assessment, combined with the Ramboll study, \ndemonstrate s that in utilizing a health -based threshold for HC l in the revised lime RTR, EPA \nwould not be relying on a \u201csingle low -confidence, low -quality\u201d risk assessment. Rather, EPA \nwill be relying on a risk assessment that includes multiple robust dose -response assessments.  \n Finally, the Sierra Club court concluded that EPA\u2019s brick/clay health- based assessment \nwas flawed because the court could not determine whether EPA provided any \u201cample margin of safety\u201d in the HCl health threshold as required by section 112(d)(4). Id.  at 13. This flaw in EPA\u2019s \nreasoning in the brick/clay context should be readily  addressed in this rulemaking  \u2013 EPA should \nbreak out specifically and set forth in precise terms its \u201cample margin of safety\u201d conclusions  \n(which it already made in the context of the risk assessment performed for the RTR) . \n \nC. EPA\u2019s New Proposed Rule Properly  Concludes that HCl is a Threshold \nPollutant  \nIn the new Proposed Rule, EPA seeks comment on potentially setting a health- based \nstandard for HCl. EPA makes several key statements that support moving to such a standard. \nFirst, EPA recognizes that even a carcinogen may have a health threshold, allowing for a health-\nbased standard  (or as denoted  by EPA, a health- based emission limit or HBEL)  to be set. EPA \nstates in the preamble:  \n \n \n20 Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the Risk and Technology \nReview 2019 Proposed Rule , EPA 2019, May, p. 27.  \n21 CalEPA defines the REL as \u201cthe concentration level at or below which no health effects are anticipated in the \ngeneral human population.\u201d  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 35 With regard to  carcinogenicity, it is important to acknowledge that the science and \nmethods of cancer risk assessment have evolved over the 33 years since the CAA \namendments were issued. The EPA now recognizes that carcinogens can be either non-threshold or threshold po llutants.  Linear non- threshold carcinogens can cause adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, at any level of exposure. In contrast, non- linear threshold \ncarcinogens may pose a cancer risk only above a certain exposure level. Based on the \nscience and methods developed over the last 33 years, and CAA section 112(d)(4)\u2019s focus \non a threshold, not cancer risk, we believe that the issue is not whether HCl is a \ncarcinogen but rather whether HCl has a threshold. \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9092 (footnotes omitted). This is an important point, although as set out above, \nEPA should properly find that HCl is not a carcinogen. \n \n EPA goes on to explain that HCl has not been shown to be mutagenic, and that evidence \nshows that there is a health threshold for hyperplasia, which could theoretically lead to cancer. 89 Fed. Reg. 9092- 9093. EPA goes on to appropriately distinguish it s current findings from \nconcerns raised by the Court in Sierra Club.  \n \n Based on these conclusions, EPA calculated a potential health -based standard for HCl, \nexplained as follows:  \n \nBased on this analysis, the HBEL would be an emission limit of 300 tpy, not to exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). We would expect such a limit to ensure that HCl emissions \nfrom this source category, while could be higher than in the proposal would remain at \nlevels consistent with a chronic HQ no greater than 0.2 and a maximum acute HQ no greater than 0.6. We request comment on whether such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety and whether additional measures would be needed to do so. \n 89 Fed. Reg. 9094.  \n  NLA strongly believes that such a standard would provide an ample margin of safety. \nNote that EPA has already performed a comprehensive risk assessment of HCl emissions from all lime plants and has (on multiple occasions) found that there are already acceptable risks with an ample margin  of safety with no additional standards at all. Thus, the suggested HBEL will \nalso provide an ample margin of safety\u2014because one already exists.  The HBEL would guarantee \nthat HCl emissions would remain below any possible le vel of concern.  NLA does not believe \nthat other measures beyond those elsewhere in the Proposed Rule would be necessary to support \nthe standard. (See discussion below of rule language changes that would be needed to implement \nthe HBEL.)  \n  In its Second Report (Appendix B ), Ramboll reviewed EPA\u2019s methodology and \nconclusions, and confirmed that EPA was correct in its evaluation of the potential risks of HCl, \nincluding EPA\u2019s findings on carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and other health effects. One point \nemphasized by Ramboll is that if HCl were a human carcinogen, it would be expected that evidence of its carcinogenicity would have emerged, given the extensive u se of the material in \nworkplace settings. Rather, as Ramboll states:  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 36  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have \nbeen studied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that many individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actuall y exposed \nto mixtures that included recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  \n \nSecond Ramboll Report, Executive Summary ( Appendix B ). Furthermore, Ramboll reviewed \nEPA\u2019s air modelling approach, and confirmed that it  was appropriate ( and conservative). \nRamboll states:  \n \nThe air modeling performed by EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to \nan acceptable margin of safety. The default assumptions of the air model are expected to \nproduce conservative air concentrations, and the definition of the receptor locations \nshould produce reasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors. In addition, the \nchronic and acute toxicity reference values used for the risk assessment are based on the \nbest available science.  \n \nId. Ramboll concludes:  \n \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll \ntherefore recommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard \nfor HCl be based on a health- based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n Id.  \n \nNLA requested that a second consultant, Trinity, also review EPA\u2019s air dispersion \nmodeling. Trinity also concluded that EPA\u2019s approach was correct. Trinity\u2019s report (accompanying these comments as Appendix C ), states:  \n \nWe did not find any material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the \nanalysis is consistent with prior methods for analyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has proposed an HBEL for HCl providing \nconservative estimates of concentrations in ambient air, the analysis relies on input data \nfrom the industry for the \u201cworst case\u201d sources and applied the air dispersion in a manner \nconsis tent with accepted practice. Therefore, we believe the predicted modeling impacts \nsupport EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime Manufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in the source category.\u201d  \n NLA strongly urges EPA to set a health -based standard for HCl, based on its own \nfindings and the confirmation provided by Ramboll  and Trinity. \n  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 37 D. Strong P olicy R easons Support  Concluding that HCl I s a T hreshold \nPollutant and P romulgating a Section 112(d)(4) S tandard  \n \nIn addition to the legal and technical arguments above, there are several strong policy \nreasons that should compel EPA to issue a s ection 112(d)(4) health- based standard for HCl in \nthis rulemaking. First, institutionally, EPA should always seek to preserve its regulatory \nauthority/flexibility in this context. And, given the powerful data in support of a health- based \nthreshold here, if  EPA concludes to the contrary, it is hard to see how EPA could ever \ndemonstrate a health threshold under s ection 112(d)(4). The Sierra Club court held that EPA is \nnot \u201cobligated to conclusively resolve every scientific uncertainty before it issues regulation.\u201d 895 F.3d at 10 (citations omitted). Specifically, relating to s ection 112(d)(4), the court held:  \n \nThe statutory term \u201cestablished\u201d does not unambiguously require that the \nEPA prove its scientific conclusions beyond all possible doubt. Nor does \nthe term \u201chealth threshold\u201d require that the EPA find a specific threshold \nthat lacks uncertainty. With respec t to scientific conclusions, \u201cestablished\u201d \nand \u201chealth threshold\u201d are ambiguous terms and we give deference to the \nEPA to the extent its interpretations fall within the bounds of \nreasonableness.  \n \nId.  \n \nUnder this standard, it would clearly  be reasonable for EPA to conclude that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant in the context of this rulemaking. Indeed, a conclusion to the contrary would be a harmful precedent, given the evidence here, and it could be read to deprive EPA of the flexibility to use health -based standards as provided under the statute. Regulating HCl using a \nhealth -based standard f or lime is not only faithful to the intent of Congress in enacting s ection \n112(d)(4) and to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s concer ns as expressed in the Sierra Club decision , but is also \na reasonable and appropriate exercise of EPA\u2019s discretion in setting standards for pollution \nprevention that protect the public with an ample margin of safety.  \n \nSecond, EPA should make it clear that even if it believes that it must set standards \npursuant to s ections 112(d)(2) and (3) for additional  HAPs, the provisions in the statute \nproviding for alternative approaches to the methods described in 112(d)(2) and (3) remain available to EPA . These include the provisions allowing a health -based standard under 112(d)(4), \nas well as the provisions providing for subcategories under 112(d)(1) and work practices under 112(h). In the case at hand, there is already a  robust existing record in support of a s ection \n112(d)(4) standard, and thus applying such a standard will not prolong the time needed to draft and promulgate a standard. \n \nFinally, use of a health -based standard would greatly simplify compliance (because there \nwould be a single standard rather than multiple subcategories), and it would also simplify  the \nissue of emissions averaging for HCl, because the health -based standard EPA suggests would be \na facility -wide standard, and not a standard for each individual kiln. EPA\u2019s own economic \nanalysis found that almost half of the capital costs of the rule (47%) are attributable to control of \nHCl. Promulgating a health- based standard would therefore significantly reduce the cost impact \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 38 of the rule on small businesses and on the lime industry, while  still protecting human health and \nthe environment.  \n \nUse of a health -based standard under s ection 112(d)(4) is particularly appropriate here. \nEPA used  two risk -based analyses and determined that there are no health risks from emissions \nof HCl from lime manufacturing facilities \u2014the first being EPA \u2019s evaluation of HCl health -based \nrisks in the original MACT rule, and the second being its section  112(f) risk analysis from the \n2020 lime RTR rule that there are no unacceptable risks from any pollutants regulated by the \nMACT standard.  \n E. How a Health -Based Standard Should Be Implemented \nIn the Proposed Rule preamble, EPA states:  \n Appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements would also be \nrequired to ensure compliance with the limit. The EPA is requesting comment on an \nappropriate structure for incorporating an HBEL in the rule text. Refer to the \nmemorandum, \u2018\u2018Revisions to 40 CFR part 63 Subpart AAAAA to Accommodate a \nHealth -Based Standard\u2019\u2019 , included in the docket for this rulemaking, for a description of \npotential revisions to the subpart to include initial compliance, continuous compliance, recordkeeping, and reporting rule language in support of an HBEL.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9094. EPA has informed NLA that the referenced docket item was not used  and \nthat the reference to it should have been deleted from the preamble, but that EPA seeks comment on potential revisions to the rule language. Below, NLA provides comment  on how a HBEL \nshould be implemented in the rule.  \n \nEPA states that, based on its analysis of risk, a  HBEL for HCl would be an emission limit \nof 300 tons per year, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour (lb/hr). NLA agrees with EPA\u2019s \nevaluation that this standard would reflect acceptable risk with an ample margin of safety. (Indeed, as noted above, this standard is very conservative.)  \n \nThe HBEL standard would be applied on a source -wide basis  (as opposed to a kiln -by-\nkiln basis). This will necessitate some changes in rule language.  \n \nProposed \u00a763.7112(n) addresses computation of emission rates for HCl and mercury. \nBecause under the HBEL, emissions of HCl will not be calculated as a production -related  rate, \nthis section will need to be modified. Suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cBlueline,\u201d \nAppendix A.  \n \nNLA suggests  the following approach to demonstrate and document compliance with the \nHBEL for HCl , to be added to \u00a763.7112:  \n \nAn LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all lime kilns is below \n300 tpy and submit this with a Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS) before the compliance date.  The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test on each \nlime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of p ound s per ton of lime produced, \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 39 multiplied by the annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl \nfor all kilns at the site.  \n \nIf the LMP includes any kilns requiring add- on controls to comply with the HBEL, the \noperator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating parameter for \nother controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain compliance with \nthe HBEL. In this case, the LMP operator will submit documentation of the operating rate for DSI on units with controls, as applicable, and a compliance demonstration annually indicating actual emissions in the prior calendar year do not e xceed 300 tpy.  \n \nAlternatively, the facility may seek a practically enforceable permit provision from the LMP\u2019s local air permitting authority that limits HCl to no more than 300 tpy.  \n The LMP shall also certify in a  NOCS, by relying on the most recent HCl performance test \ndata for each kiln, that the sum of the hourly emissions rate (i.e., the sum of 3- run averages for \neach kiln at the site) is no greater than 685 lb/hr.  \n \n Sections of the rule relating to dry sorbent injection can be left in place to apply to those \nsources that may use DSI to  achieve the HBEL.  \n If EPA applies the HBEL, sections of the Proposed Rule  relating to emissions averaging \nwill not be necessary for HC l, because the standard is a sum of source -wide emissions and not an \naverage. These should be modified to remove references to HCl. These sections include \u00a763.7114 (b) and (c) , \u00a763.7121(g), and Table 9  (delete lines 1 through 6).  \n Table 1, lines 5 through 12, sh ould be replaced with \n \nFor\u2026  You must meet the following emission limit  \n5. All major sources  HCl emissions from all kilns must not exceed \n300 tons per year  (tpy) , and must not exceed \n685 pounds per hour (lb/hr)  \n Table 5, line 19, sh ould be replaced with:  \n           \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 40 For . . .

For a positive pressure FF or ESP, determine the number of sampling points per the stratification check procedures  of section  8.1.2 of \nMethod 7E using the sample \npoints determined using the \nprocedures of Section 8 of  \nEPA  Method  5D. \n \n Changes to other tables will not be necessary.  \n  NLA strongly urges EPA to adopt the suggested HBEL, for all the reasons stated above.  \n XIV. EPA ACTED REASONABLY IN PROPOSING  SUBCATEGORIES FOR HCL  \n As noted above, EPA should abide by its longstanding finding in 2004 that HCl is a \nthreshold pollutant (and not a carcinogen) and should establish a health- based standard for HCl \npursuant to Clean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) in lieu of a MACT floor standard.  \n If, however, EPA continues to pursue non- health -based emissions standards for HCl, \nNLA supports the proposal to establish subcategories . NLA supports the six subcategories EPA \nhas proposed. EPA has made several technical corrections to the subcategory analyses and MACT floors  in the new Proposed Rule, which NLA supports .\n23 \n \nA. EPA H as Flexibility to Set Standards for S ubcategories  \n Clean Air Act s ection 112(d)(1) provides : \u201cThe Administrator may distinguish among \nclasses, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory in establishing such standards except that, there shall be no delay in the compliance date for any standard applicable to any source under subs ection (i) as the result of the authority provided by this sentence.\u201d  Under \nsection 112(d)(3) , the standard can be no less stringent than:  \n \n(A) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information), excluding those sources that have, within 18 months before the emission standard is proposed or \nwithin 30 months before such standard is promulgated, whichever is later, first achieved a \n \n22 See discussion below on the addition of Method 26.26A.  \n23 NLA\u2019s \u201cblueline\u201d of suggested rule language changes in Appendix B reflects inclusion of a health- based standard \nfor HCl. If EPA declines to set a health -based standard, several changes to the language would be required, as set \nout in this section, and in the section on emissions averaging above.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 41 level of emission rate or emission reduction which complies, or would comply if the \nsource is not subject to such standard, with the lowest achievable emission rate (as \ndefined by section 7501 of this title) applicable to the source category and prevailing at the time, in the category or subcategory for categories and subcategories with 30 or more \nsources, or  \n(B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources (for which the Administrator has or could reasonably obtain emissions information) in the category \nor subcategory for categories or subcategories with fewer than 30 sources.  \n \nAccordingly, if a subcategory has fewer than 30 sources, the standard is based on the average \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources.  \n \nEPA\u2019s decision to set subcategories  has been repeatedly upheld by the courts. In Sierra \nClub v. EPA , 895 F.3d 1 (D.C. Cir. 2018), the court upheld EPA\u2019s  decision to establish \nsubcategories for brick kilns by size. In setting a brick MACT floor, EPA set separate standards for PM (used as a surrogate for non -mercury hazardous metals) and mercury, with subcategories \nfor large tunnel and small tunnel brick ki lns. NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products \nManufacturing; and NESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufacturing, 80 Fed. Reg. 65470, 65471 \n(Oct. 26, 2015) .  \n In U.S. Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579 (D.C. Cir. 2016), the court upheld EPA\u2019s \nestablishment of subcategories for major boilers (based on primary fuel combusted and method \nused to feed the boiler), and for area boilers (based on size) . The court held that EPA \u2019s creation \nof subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers burned was based on a reasonable interpretation of CAA provisions  permitting EPA to distinguish among \u201cclasses, types, and \nsizes\u201d of sources when establishing hazardous air  pollutant emissions standards, and was not \narbitrary and capricious, even though a single boiler could use different fuels over the course of \nits lifetime . EPA explained that boilers varied in their designs depending on the  type of fuel they \nburned, which affected boiler emissions and the feasibility of emissions controls. Id. a t 656. EPA \ndemonstrated with sufficient evidence that burning a different fuel made a boiler a different type of boiler, and thus EPA \u2019s creation of subcategories of boilers based on the type of fuel the boilers \nburned was not arbitrary or capricious . Id. a t 657.  \n  In the Proposed Rule , EPA base s its HCl subcategories on two factors that affect HCl \nemissions, as shown by data analyzed by EPA \u2014kiln type (preheater rotary, straight rotary, and \nvertical), and lime product produced (high calcium lime and dolomitic lime). EPA reasonably determined that these differences in equipment and in product resulted in differences in \nemissions that justify establishment of subcategories. NLA fully supports this determination, as \nexplained in more detail below . \n \nThe proposed HCl subcategories for the lime manufacturing industry are based on kiln \ntype (i.e., straight rotary, preheater rotary, and vertical ), and lime product (high calcium \nquicklime or dolomitic lime) . The six subcategories proposed by EPA are : \n \na. Straight rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nb. Straight rotary kilns making high calcium  quicklime   \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 42 c. Preheater rotary kilns making dolomitic lime and dead- burned dolomitic lime  \nd. Preheater rotary kilns making high calcium quicklime  \ne. Vertical kilns making dolomitic quicklime and/or dead -burned dolomitic lime  \nf. Vertical kilns making high calcium quicklime  \n \nNLA supports these subcategories , which are explored in more detail below. \n \nB. Subcategorization by Kiln Type  Is Appropriate \n \nSubcategorization by kiln type include s the following:  \n \na. Straight Rotary  kilns  \nb. Preheater Rotary  kilns  \nc. Vertical kilns  \n \nHCl emissions from rotary kilns equipped with a preheater are typically lower than a \nstraight rotary kiln with no preheater. This is because , among other things, HCl that exits the kiln \ncan be chemically adsorbed by lime (CaO) and limestone (CaCO 3) in the preheater  section of the \nkiln. This has the overall effect of lowering HCl stack emissions. In addition, the stack \ntemperature of a preheater kiln is lower than a straight rotary kiln , which lowers HCl formation.  \n \nConversely, a straight rotary kiln with no preheater and similar inputs has HCl emissions \nhigher than a preheater equivalent. Both kiln types will have some adsorption of HCl in the rotary kiln, but a straight rotary kiln does not have the additional oppor tunity for HCl adsorption \nin the preheater.  \n \nVertical lime kilns also have a different emissions profile from straight kilns. In vertical \nkilns, close contact between the gases in the kiln and the stone and lime tends to scrub out HCl emissions.  \n C. Subcategorization by Lime Product Produced  Is Appropriate  \n \nIn addition to kiln type, lime sources should be further subcategorized by product type , as \nEPA proposed:  \n \na. High calcium quicklime  \nb. Dolomitic lime  (and dead- burned dolomitic lime)  \n \nThe data in the record show that kilns producing dolomitic lime consistently have \nsignificantly higher HCl emissions than kilns producing high calcium lime (this is true even \nwhen the two kinds of product are produced in the same kiln). These differences are due to \ndifferences i n the stone feedstock, and not because of fuels or equipment. Dolomitic lime is \nmade from naturally occurring stone with a higher percentage of magnesium chloride than high calcium quickl ime. Also, it should be noted that dolomitic l ime and high calcium quick lime are \ndifferent products and have different uses and markets. Accordingly, the differences in HCl \nemissions between these two types of lime are appropriate for subcategorization.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 43  \nD. Subcategory for Vertical Kilns Making Dolomitic Lime  \n \nData submitted to EPA pursuant to the previous Information Collection Request (ICR) \ndid not include data on vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime, so in the January 2023 Proposed Rule, E PA grouped all vertical kilns into  a single category. NLA \u2019s prior comments noted, \nhowever, that in  categorizing HCl emissions, vertical kilns producing dolomitic lime should be \ngrouped with preheater kilns producing dolomitic lime, because in this case, similarities related to product type are more significant than similar ities in kiln equipment.\n In the 2004 Proposed \nRule, EPA places vertical kilns making dolomitic lime and dead -burned dolomitic lime into their \nown subcategory, but with the same applicable HCl standard as  preheater kilns making these products. NLA supports this change.  \n  \nXV. HCL \u2014TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nA. The MACT F loor C alculations for HCl Have Been Properly Corrected for \nthe Straight Rotary High Calcium Quicklime ( SR, QL) and Preheater \nRotary, High Calcium Quicklime  (PR, QL), Except that the Limit for \nStraight Rotary Kilns Making Quicklime Has Been Incorrectly Calculated  \n \nIn EPA\u2019s prior MACT floor analysis, five kiln s were miscategorized as preheater rotary \nkilns, when in fact  they are straight rotary kiln s. EPA has properly corrected this error, which \naffects the MACT floor numbers for the SR , QL and PR , QL subcategories , except that the limit \nfor straight rotary kilns making quicklime has been incorrectly calculated (see discussion below) . \nThe necessary corrections were detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments, which are incorporated here \nby reference. ( EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0166.)  \n \n The MACT floor  limits  based on these corrections  that NLA suggested EPA should \npromulgate for the subcategories are summarized below:  \n \nTable A: Corrected  Hydrogen Chloride MACT Floor Limits for New and Existing Lime \nManufacturing Sources  \nKiln Type1 Lime Produced2 New Source MACT \nFloor Limit \n(lb/ton of lime produced)  Existing Source MACT \nFloor Limit \n(lb/ton of lime produced)  \nSR24 DL, DB  1.7 2.3 \nSR QL 0.015  2.5825 \nPR, VK  DL, DB  0.39 0.3926 \nPR QL 0.096  0.096  \nVK QL 0.021  0.021  \n \n24 Limits for the SR DL,  DB subcategory have been revised to be consistent with Table 1  of the proposed rule  \nredline . \n25 EPA has proposed a lower number for this subcategory. EPA\u2019s number is incorrect, as explained below, and 2.58 \nshould be used in the final rule.  \n26 EPA now proposes to set  a separate subcategory for vertical kilns making dolomitic and deadburned dolomitic \nlime, but setting  the same standard as preheater kilns making those products. NLA supports this change.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 44 Note:  \n1 - Straight Rotary (SR), preheater rotary (PR), vertical (VK)  \n2 - Dolomitic lime ( DL), high- calcium quicklime (QL), dead burned dolomite (DB)  \n \nB. EPA\u2019s Emission Limit  for HCl from Existing Straight Kilns Producing \nQuicklime  Must Be Corrected  \nEPA\u2019s proposed emission limit for existing straight kilns producing quicklime is \ncalculated using an upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation that incorrectly assumes that the \ndata set is statistically skewed. This approach does not follow EPA guidance or prior precedent.  In fact, EPA has arbitrarily deviated from prior UP L calculation precedent, applying a new \nprocedural precedent to set this UPL limitation.   \nFollowing the instructions in EPA\u2019s own UPL calculation tool used in prior iterations of \nthis rulemaking and in other similar UPL limit setting exercises, the data set should be considered \u201clognormal .\u201d However, with respect to  this particular standard, EPA has arbitrarily \napplied a new statistical test, the Shapiro -Wilk test, which identified the data set as \u201cskewed\u201d. \nThe use of the Shapiro -Wilk test is not included in EPA guidance regarding the use of UPLs nor \nis NLA aware of any precedent for using this test in UPL MACT setting rulemakings. Further, \nEPA\u2019s memorandum Use of the Upper Prediction Limit for Calculating MACT Floors  included \nin this docket states: \u201cTo evaluate the distribution of  the data, EPA checks each dataset for \ndistribution characteristics by applying skewness and kurtosis tests.\u201d  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015- 0177)  Thus, EPA\u2019s established method already applies skewness and kurtosis tests, \nrendering it unnecessary and unreasonable in this  case to use the Shapiro -Wilk test.  \n \nIn this case, EPA apparently first evaluated the dataset in its traditional method using its \nUPL Calculation tool. As mentioned above, EPA\u2019s tool clearly concludes that the dataset is lognormal , resulting in a UPL limitation of 2. 58 lb/ ton lime produced. For reasons that are \nunclear , EPA abandoned the established approach and applied a new procedure, the Shapiro-\nWilk test, to conclude the dataset is \u201cskewed ,\u201d resulting in a much lower  UPL limitation of 0.52 \nlb/ton lime produced.  \n \nThe Shapiro- Wilk test is a statistically conservative methodology for determining \nwhether a data set is normal or lognormally distributed. This methodology only allows for a very narrow band of p- values to \u201cpass\u201d the normality test. The Shapiro- Wilk test is known to be \nconservative, especially for larger data sets as all data must be in a  narrow range. In other words, \nthis Shapiro- Wilk test significantly increases  the likelihood of a finding that  a dataset is \n\u201cskewed\u201d and not \u201clognormal .\u201d \n Although this methodology is not supported by precedent in EPA\u2019s extensive  history of \nsetting MACT limits, NLA has reviewed this data set using this test. As shown in graph below, the data set using this new test is not normally distributed because a small subset of values lie \nslightly outside of the p- value allowable range.  Th e outcome is that EPA\u2019s proposed limitation \nis substantially and unreasonably lowered.  \n \n \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 45 Figure 1 \u2013 Illustration of the Shapiro - Wilk Test Results and Corresponding P -values  \n \n \n  \nIn the figure , the limited data points outside the blue shaded areas force the conservative \nconclusion from the Shapiro- Wilk test that the dataset is \u201cskewed\u201d contrary to EPA\u2019s \nconventional normality tests for setting UPLs. \n \nIn addition to the arbitrary application of the Shapiro -Wilk test, and EPA\u2019s failure to \nfollow its own established procedures, the calculated emission limit fails to  develop an emission \nlimit that is achievable even by the MACT Floor sources. EPA utilizes the UPL methodology to \ncalculate an emission limit that MACT Floor sources are capable of meeting within 99% certainty. In this case, n ot only is the proposed limit equal to the average result of one of the \nMACT Floor sources, two of the three runs for tha t kiln are equal to or greater than the proposed \nlimit. Establishing an emission limit with which even the MACT Floor sources cannot continuously comply does not meet Clean Air Act MACT limit requirements. This outcome is \nunlawful and further demonstrates  that EPA\u2019s new use of the Shapiro- Wilk test does not properly \nset a MACT UPL limitation.  \n \nEPA should set the limitation based on its traditional method using its UPL Calculation \nTool and set  the limitation for this subcategory at 2.58 lb/ ton lime produced. \n \nC. EPA Should Authorize Use of Method 26/26A to Measure HCl   \nMethod 26/26A should be allowed by EPA to determine compliance with the proposed \nHCl emissions limits. Method 26/26A (used in testing HC l) was omitted from  Table 7 in the \npreamble to the January 2023 Proposed Rule  (88 F ed. Reg. 815) , and is also absent from Table 5, \nRow 19, in the redline in the docket . Method 26/26A is a standard isokinetic method that can be \nrun concurrently with PM sampling.  \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 46  \nIn Method 26/26A, gas is withdrawn from the source and collected directly in acidified \nimpingers. The impinger solution captures the HCl, and drives it to chloride ions, where it is analyzed by ion-chromatography. This is a simple approach that does not have the sample trans port difficulties found in the direct interface FTIR approach. It is one of EPA\u2019s promulgated \nmethods ( see https://www.epa.gov/emc/emc-promulgated- test-methods\n; see a lso 40 CFR Part \n60, Appendix A-8), and it is allowed in other NESHAP rules ( see, e.g., 40 CFR section 63.7520 \nand Table 5  (boilers and process heaters)). Method 26/26A has several advantages over the more \ntechnically complex and expensive M.320/321. I t can allow for significantly lower detection \nlimits, does not require a trained FTIR specialist on site to operate the equipment, and is significantly quicker. The limited availability of trained FTIR specialists will be problematic for both the lime industry and the testing industry. Additional costs are significant and can easily be greater than $10K/plant using FTIR. M26/26A is a tried and tested accepted method for HCl analyses and is allowed for compliance demonstration in other industries, including in EPA\u2019s recent final taconite rule. \n  EPA should authorize the use of Method 26/26A as an approved method for HCl \ncompliance testing.  References to Method 26/26A should be added to \u00a763.7142, Table 4 line 1, \nand Table 5 line 19.  MERCURY  \n XVI. EPA SHOULD APPLY AN INTRA- QUARRY VARIABILITY FACTOR FOR \nMERCURY  \n On December 9, 2021, NLA\u2019s consultant Trinity Consultants submitted a memorandum \n(EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0074), explaining how EPA should set an intra -quarry va riability \nfactor (IQV) for mercury for lime plants, with supporting data. In the new Proposed Rule , EPA \nhas proposed an IQV, and NLA commends EPA for doing so. However, NLA believes that the IQV proposed by EPA should be adjusted to allow sources more flexibility in meeting mercury standards.  \nThe purpose of an IQV is to account for long-term variation in mercury content \nthroughout the quarry and has been incorporated into other standards with significantly sparser  \ndata than the lime  industry has provided. It is important to note that IQV stands for intra -quarry \nvariability, not inter- quarry variability. The point of the exercise is to understand how mercury \nconcentrations may vary in each quarry over time. \n NLA believes that in a case in which emissions of mercury are not controlled by add -on \npollution control devices, but rather depend on inputs from feedstocks, it would be arbitrary and capricious not to apply a reasonable IQV. Without an IQV, the MACT floor \u201cbest performer\u201d \u2014\nthe source that currently has the lowest mercury emissions\u2014could later find itself in violation of the standard if it is excavating limestone  with higher mercury levels from a different part of the \nquarry. The concept of the MACT floor p erformers is that these sources can meet the standard \nwithout additional controls\u2014something EPA cannot assert  for mercury in this rulemaking \nwithout applying an appropriate IQV.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 47  \nSufficient data is available to establish an IQV for the lime industry . As provided in \nAppendix I (1-13) to NLA\u2019s prior comments  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0166) , the lime \nindustry has 422 kiln feed samples as well as 61 samples from the Eden, Wisconsin quarry. This \nis substantially  more data than found in the docket for the Brick and Structural Clay Products \nNESHAP , for which  EPA promulgated an IQV standard. Nationwide, the Brick/Clay industry \nprovided 167 samples and the final IQV used in calculating the mercury standard for their \nindustry was based on seven samples from four plants.27 \n \nA. EPA Should Use Quarry Data from the MACT Floor Sources  \n \nAn intra -quarry variability (IQV) factor would account for variability in the mercury \ncontent of the raw material over the long- term life of the quarry. NLA\u2019s suggested approach to \nachieving  this objective is  well documented and supported by information supplied to EPA  \nduring its rulemaking process. The data showed that intr a-quarry variability of mercury in the \nreal world is relatively high , and would have a significant impact on the mercury MACT floor . \nThis is a strong justification for applying an IQV, n ot a reason for declining to do so.   \n \nThe Eden quarry samples are more representative of this long- term variability  than are \nkiln feed samples, because  they represent limestone that will be used in the kiln over the life of \nthe quarry. S amples that represent the life of the quarry are far more representative of IQV than \nmaterials stockpiled over hours, days or a week in transient short -term stockpiles.  In addition, the \nsamples from the Eden quarry were taken from drill holes throughout the quarry and at approximately 6- foot intervals. As such, each sample represents a section of the quarry that \nwould be mined over decades of quarry operation. As such, the originally proposed IQV based on data  for the two MACT floor plants , which includes quarry samples  from Eden  and kiln feed \nsamples from both plants, is appropriate for setting a UPL -based standard. In addition, EPA \nshould use this quarry  data because it represents the MACT floor source.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Use of Weighted Average Data in the Intra -Quarry Variability I s Not \nTechnically Sound, and EPA Should Use the Calculations Provided by NLA  \nNLA is pleased that EPA now proposes to apply an IQV based on data from the two \nMACT floor sources. However, EPA\u2019s calculation of the IQV must be corrected.  \n The methodology utilized by EPA in the proposed rulemaking does not properly reflect \nthe variability of mercury content in limestone  that should be reflected in an emissions limitation \nfor a lime kiln. As detailed in NLA\u2019s prior comments on this rulemaking, an IQV is utilized to incorporate variability in limestone mercury content into the upper prediction limit (UPL) calculation used in developing an emission lim it.  \n In NLA\u2019s proposed methodology for applying an IQV to this rulemaking, limestone \nmercury content for the two kilns in the MACT floor were utilized to calculate an IQV. The proposed rulemaking also uses this data set, but EPA chose to use weighted average mercury content rather than individual test values. Limestone samples collected from each of the five \n \n27 EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0660, Appendix E  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 48 boreholes collected from a MACT pool quarry were weighted to reduce bias from varying \nsample interval thicknesses.  Weighted sample data enables meaningful comparison across the \nquarry and within each geological unit. In other words, sample weighting supports compar ison \nfor geological study purposes , but weighting is not appropriate for an IQV calculation where \ncapturing variability is necessary  and appropriate .28 \nA consequence of sample weighting is to lower the standard deviation of the data set , and \nlower the relative standard deviation, which significantly  reduces the IQV and corresponding \nemission rate, as much of the variability in the data set is averaged out. A data set of 70 data \npoints was reduced to only 7 with EPA\u2019s approach, thus mathematically suppressing the natural \nvariability that the IQV must account for.  \n An IQV is intended to adjust a UPL -based emission limit to reflect the expected stack \ntesting results for the MACT Floor sources for any reasonably expected mercury content. By \nusing weighted averages, EPA\u2019s calculations assume that all limestone in each core sample \nwould have the same mercury content or be burned during a single stack test. However, e ach of \nthese core samples represents a larger volume of stone across the deposit (in contrast  to the \nspecific grab sample data). Furthermore, using averages r eflects false assumption with respect to \nhow the quarry will be mined in practice , and how the mine\u2019s  stone will eventually be processed \nin a lime kiln , and when mercury would actually be emitted. That is, any single  (unaveraged) Hg \ndata point could represent stone fed to a kiln over any one day, month or year.  \n \nTherefore, EPA should not apply quarry data averaging and should rather base the \nexisting source Hg limitation on NLA\u2019s originally proposed mercury emission limit of 50.0 \npounds mercury per million tons of limit produced. This  remains the appropriate emission limit \nfor existing sources.  \n \nC. EPA\u2019s Proposal to Not Use the Best Performing Emission Source to Set the  \nMercury Limit for New Kilns I s Arbitrary and Unlawful  \nEPA evaluated two options for setting the mercury emission limit for new kilns, one \nusing the best performing source (at Graymont\u2019s Eden Plant) and one using the second- best \nperforming source (at Carmeuse\u2019s Maysville Plant) . EPA proposes to set the new kiln limit based \non the Maysville Plant . In each case, EPA included an IQV using the mercury limestone content \ndata for only that plant. As a result, EPA sets a lower standard for new kilns that it would have \nset based on the best performing plant, because of the difference in IQVs.  \n The Maysville Plant has only seven mercury content values on which to set an IQV , all \nbased on limestone feed data during two events. The Eden Plant data set is more extensive with \ncore data sampling throughout the quarry which better represents the mercury variability of the \nquarry over time. The  Maysville feed data is much more limited, and thus less able to show the \nvariability t hroughout the full quarry. A ny new kiln may be built at a limestone quarry with \nvarying mercury content similar to the Eden Pla nt quarry. It  is unreasonable to assume that any \nfuture kiln would have homogenous mercury content throughout its  limestone supply (and \nindeed, feed pile data may not accurately indicate mercury content in the quarry, because, as \n \n28 A more detailed explanation of this point is set out in NLA member Graymont\u2019s separate comments.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 49 EPA notes in the preamble, feed piles represent only a small portion of the quarry, and not a mix \nof multiple areas of the quarry ).  \n \nNotwithstanding the comments on calculating the IQV, setting an emission limit for new \nsources that is not based on the best -performing emission unit does not align with EPA policies \nand precedent. The Eden Plant kiln is the best -performing emission unit a nd based on available \nmercury data for the Eden quarry this unit itself cannot be reasonably assured to comply with the \nproposed emission limit  for new kilns .  \n \nEPA should set the new source emission limit based on the best -performing source rather \nthan arbitrarily using the second- best source.  \n \nORGANICS  \n \nXVII.  USE OF THC AS A SURROGATE FOR ORGANIC HAPS  IS UNLAWFUL   \n In its comments on the January 23, 2023, Proposed Rule  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0166) , NLA submitted extensive information demonstrating that Total Hydrocarbons (THC) \ncannot  be used as a surrogate for organic HAPs, because emissions of THC do not correlate with \nemissions of organic HAPs. Because EPA has appropriately decided not to use THC in this way, those points are not repeated here, but are incorporated herein by reference.  \n \nXVIII.  EPA \u2019S PROPOSAL TO SET AN AGGREGATED (TOTAL) ORGANIC HAP \nSTANDARD IS AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH , BUT CORRECTIONS ARE \nNEEDED  \n A. NLA Supports EPA \u2019s Proposal to S et a S tandard B ased on O rganic HAPs \nDetected and M easured at L ime P lants  \n In a December 6, 2021, memorandum  (EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0068) , NLA urged \nEPA to adopt an emission standard based on an aggregate of organic HAPs , similar to the \nalternative that was established for  the cement industry. NLA performed, with the help of a well -\nrespected  technical consultant  (Alliance  Tech nical Group (\u201cAlliance \u201d)), a comprehensive review \nof oHAP testing done during the rule development period. Rather than focusing only on the nine  \noHAPs that were previously submitted, the consultant thoroughly reviewed the Method 320 \nspectra fro m twelve stack tests conducted at major source lime kilns in order to identify all \ndetectable oHAPs in the tests. This review  resulted in the identification of six  additional oHAPs  \n(including the four identi fied by EPA) , providing a complete picture of oHAPs present using \napproved test methods , as shown on Table IV below . More details on this analysis are found in \nNLA\u2019s prior comments and its appendices , EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0166.  \n \nNLA, with the assistance of Alliance, generated a table including the complete list of \nidentified oHAPs that could be included in an aggregated oHAP alternative. This list includes (a) all oHAP s detected using EPA methods M.18 and M.320 and specific to lime kilns identified in \nstack test reports provided to EPA  in the 2016 s ection 114 ICR, and as part of a voluntary collect  \nion effort by the industry in 2021- 22, and (b) 6 additional oHAPs identified by new review of the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 50 test spectra, including all four of the additional oHAPs  identified by EPA in the January 2023 \nProposed Rule preamble (88 Fed.

NLA\u2019s prior comments urged EPA to \nselect this  aggregated limit as a reasonable threshold for organic HAP based on the specificity of \nthe HAP emitted from lime kilns combined with the low concentration and detection frequency.  \n This approach to an oHAP limitation is consistent with the C lean A ir Act and EPA\u2019s \nprecedents in establishing MACT emissions limitations . As noted above, THC is an \ninappropriate surrogate for organic HAPs in the lime industry . An aggregated (total) oHAP limit, \non the other hand, is a better option because it causes the allowable emission limit to be directly linked to the regulated pollutants and excludes irrelevant substances  that THC would include. \nThe use of an aggregated oHAP alternative was used in the Portland Cement  MACT , \nrecognizing inherent differences in emissions of oHAPs and THC from cement kilns. Lastly, the \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 51 proposed aggregated oHAP limit follows established conventions that EPA is proposing for D/F \nin this rulemaking. The limit for D/F is based on the aggregate amount of D/F congeners and \ngiven their very low levels below detection limits, the use of three times the Representative Detection Limit (3xRDL) setting method is appropriate in such cases.\n29,30 \n \n Use of an aggregated oHAP limit is also appropriate here because of the very low oHAP \nemissions, the very low detection limits for many of the substances, the sporadic appearance of \nthese substances (note that no HAP listed above appeared in all tests, and many were not \ndetected in a majority of tests) ,31 and EPA\u2019s prior determination that risks from organic HAPs \nare acceptable with an ample margin of safety even with no additional controls at all.  Overall, the \nuse of a n aggregated  organic HAP limitation is superior to THC as a surrogate and should be \nincorporated into the final rulemaking. \n \nThus, EPA should use an aggregated oHAP approach as the emission standard for lime \nplants . Under this approach, sources would perform 5- year compliance testing for all the oHAPs \non the list, and compliance would be based on the total aggregate detected being lower than the aggregate standard. Continuous compliance would be ensured by parametric monitoring of air pollution control devices.  \n B. EPA\u2019s Proposed 8 -HAP Aggregate oHAP Standard Must Be Corrected  \nNLA is pleased that EPA has adopted the approach of setting an aggregate oHAP \nstandard  based on the sum of 3 times the representative detection limit (RDL) of a group of \noHAPs. EPA has proposed to base the standard on 8 organics (as opposed to the 15 set out by NLA), as follows:  \n        \n      \n \n29 See EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117. Memorandum from Steffan Johnson, USEPA Regarding \nDetermination of \u201cnon- detect\u201d from EPA Method 29 (multi -metals) and EPA Method 23 (dioxin/furan) test data \nwhen evaluating the setting of MACT floors versus establishing work practice standards.  \n30 See EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0112. Memorandum to Docket EPA -HQ-OAR -2002- 0058 \nfrom Peter Westlin, EPA/OAQPS/SPPD regarding Measurement Detection Capabilities for EPA for Instrumental \nTest Methods.  \n31 Another reason THC should not be used as a surrogate for oHAPs is that no single oHAP is \u201cinvariantly present \u201d \nin the proposed surrogate as required in Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d 976 984 (D.C. Cir. 2004) . \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 52 Table C: EPA\u2019s Proposed  Aggregate Organic HAP Standard  \nPollutant  RDL (ppmvd @  \n7 percent O2)  3xRDL (ppmvd  \n@ 7 percent O2)  \nFormaldehyde  0.14 0.42 \nAcetaldehyde  0.29 0.87 \nToluene  0.014  0.02832 \nBenzene  0.022  0.066  \nXylenes (mixture of m,  \no, and p isomers)  0.023  0.069  \nStyrene  0.0043  0.013  \nEthyl benzene  0.057  0.18 \nNaphthal ene 0.0081  0.025  \n                                                  TOTAL  1.7 \n \nNLA requested that experts in FTIR and detection limits at Alliance review EPA\u2019s \nrevised approach and calculations, and this review revealed that certain elements of EPA\u2019s \napproach require  correction. (Alliance\u2019s report is Appendix D , and the accompanying Excel \nspreadsheets have been submitted separately as Appendix D2.)  \n EPA\u2019s proposed RDLs for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde differ substantially from the \nRDLs calculated and submitted by Alliance. While there are also differences with respect to the other HAPs on the list  between EPA\u2019s proposal and Alliance\u2019 s suggested values , they vary much \nless. These differences appear to stem from differences in how detection limits are set for HAPs measured using Method 320 (used for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde) , and those measured \nusing Method 18 (used for the other oHAPs on EPA\u2019s  list). With Method 18, each analytical \nlaboratory typically uses a standard detection limit, based on testing of that lab\u2019s equipment and its capabilities. These tend to be similar to each other  across the analytical service industry , and \nthus there is not likely to be a large range of values. With Method 320, on the other hand, a detection limit is calculated with respect to each test that is performed, and it can vary substantially, particularly if proper procedures are not followed in determining the detection limit.  \n In developing its proposed RDLs for the 8 HAPs, EPA averaged the five lowest detection \nlimits used in tests for each HAP. This averaging approach did not produce anomalous results for \nHAPs tested using Method 18 because, as noted above , labs use a single value for all tests, and \nthey tend to be similar. However, as detection limits for Method 320 tests vary due to factors \nother than the lab\u2019s capability, arbitrary use of the five lowest values creates anomalous results, and does not generate a representativ e value. Instead of averaging only the five lowest detection \nlimits, EPA should (at least for the Method 320 tests), average all of the detection limits, to \ngenerate a more representative result. In setting the similar aggregated standard in the cement \nrule, EPA averaged the detection limits for all tests, and it should follow that precedent in this \nrule as well.  The purpose of averaging is to identify representative detection limits, not to \nidentify the arguably best performing labs.  \n \n \n32 Note: There is a calculation error in the proposed chart from the preamble. The 3xRDL value shown for toluene is \nonly 2 times the RDL, not 3 times as it should be. This should be corrected, and the correct number should be .042 \n(although the sum still rou nds to 1.7).  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 53 Further review by Alliance of the same source testing reports used by EPA in its \nevaluation  revealed that some of the detection limits from stack tests should not have been used \nto calculate RDLs . Removing those results from the averaging yields a smaller number of tests to \nbe averaged, making the consideration of the issue of whether to average only the lowest results \nunnecessary.  \n \n  The discussion below explains why several  source testing  reports should be removed \nfrom EPA\u2019s analysis  and from the computed average. It also discusses several other corrections \nto the calculations that should be made. For the reasons discussed above, t his discussion \naddresses only the Method 320 HAPs (formaldehyde and acetaldehyde), because revision of the Method 18 results would not alter the final limit significantly.  \n1. EPA Should U se Method Detection Limits Determined O nly U sing t he \nMDC #2 Approach  \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data used \nby EPA . Both are from ASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA \nMethod 320, which is the standard method for FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from \nstationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL documentation, and are thus not \nincluded in further discussion, because it cannot be determined if proper methods were used to \ngenerate the MDLs used in those reports.  \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the \ndetector noise in a pure blank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound. This is \nuseful to determine the analytical uncertainty of a value, but it is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the \nnoise of the detector, but with the inclusion of major matrix interference. This is generally \nregarded as a more appropriate MDL determination since FTIR is an optical measur ement, and \nelevated absorbances from interference can significantly impact the analyzers ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration). Past EPA guidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for  data , and Allianc e confirms that MDC#2 is the preferred \napproach for this analysis . \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2 \n(see Tables 1 & 2). EPA\u2019s calculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four \nreports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the determination of the proposed measurement limit.  \nEPA should revise  the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard \ndirective of using MDC#2 calculated results to determine an appropriate calculation of a \nrepresentative detection limit. As the charts below show, when only MDC#2 results are used, \ndifferent (and higher) average values for both formaldehyde and acetaldehyde are produced.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 54 Table  D: Comparison of Detection Limits for M320 oHAPs Between MDC#1 and \nMDC#2 Procedures  \n \n  \n \n EPA should revise its RDL calculations to reflect these corrected values from Table 2 for \nthe two method 320 HAPs. \n2. MDLs Should be Summed on the Same Basis of Moisture and Oxygen  \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet basis (i.e., not corrected for moisture) , and \ndry corrected basis. This creates a certain amount of noise in the data set. Ultimately the detection limit values in the Proposed Rule  do not appear to contain a correction for moisture in \nthe source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other components. For example,  if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture \ncorrected basis from a source that contains 1 5% moisture , the result  becomes 1.176 ppmvd. \nWhere results from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same \nbasis, rather than a mix of wet and dry corrected results. As this total result may contain some \nmix of detected and non -detected compounds, the MDLs used for this standard setting should \ninclude this adjustment criteria.  \nSimilarly , as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, an  \naverage oxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the floor calculation. These corrections are included in the discussion of a bulk correction factor \nbelow. \n3. EPA Should U se a Bulk Average Correction Factor  \nIn the Proposed Rule , the value s of multiple chemical species are summed to determine \ncompliance with a limit that is based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen \nconcentration. V alues included in the summation must be corrected to this basis. To  set an \nemissions limit that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to \nmatch before  including them in the sum. From the reports reviewed by Alliance, the average \ncombined correction factor results in an increase of 22% to the re sults. However , Alliance notes  \nthat this is a source -specific correction factor depending on the moisture and oxygen content \nnative to the source. As such, attempting to normalize the limit based on adjusted results can \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 55 have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions. Given the variability, \nAlliance recommends  taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating \nthe standard . \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those \ncases the individual sources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table. Three reports \nwere excluded due to the variety of testing conditions that included abnormally high or low \noxygen and moisture concentrations . \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) \ndetermined by separately averaging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average \ncorrection factor for each. These average factors were then combined for a total correction factor. \nA second calculation determines the total correction factor for each source, then looks at an \naverage of these bulk correction factors. Both calculations are presented in Alliance\u2019s  Table \nreproduced below. Notably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the average of total factors from each report. \nTable  E: Summary of Moisture and Oxygen Correction Factors to Be Applied to \nDetection Limits  \n \n  Accordingly, EPA should apply a bulk correction factor of 1.217 to the RDL calculations \nfor formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  \n4. EPA Should U se Corrected M.320 Method Detection Limits  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the emissions limit determination, and accounting for \nthe corrections that must be applied to all formaldehyde and acetaldehyde data for summation, \nAlliance\u2019s  analysis shows a  standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 ppmvd @7% O\n2 \nformaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O 2 for acetaldehyde. Therefore, EPA should adopt these \n\n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 56 RDLs  for use in the aggregated oHAP limit.  As shown in the table  below, correcting these values \nresults in an aggregated emission limit of 5.9 ppmvd @ 7% O 2, and EPA should adopt this value  \nas the limit in the final rule.  \nTable  F: Proposed Aggre gate oHAP Limi t with Corrections Applied  \n \nPollutant  RDL (ppmvd @  \n7 percent O2)  3xRDL (ppmvd  \n@ 7 percent O2)  \nFormaldehyde  0.88 2.64 \nAcetaldehyde  0.94 2.82 \nToluene  0.014  0.042 \nBenzene  0.022  0.066  \nXylenes (mixture of m,  \no, and p isomers)  0.023  0.069  \nStyrene  0.0043  0.013  \nEthyl benzene  0.057  0.18 \nNaphthalene  0.0081  0.025  \n                                                  TOTAL  5.9 \n \n5. EPA Should Allow the Use of Zero for Non -Detected oHAPs , and Should \nRevise the Definition of Total Organic HAPs  \n \nWithin the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d in \u00a763.7143 in the docket redline, EPA \nstates:  \n If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the  \nmethod defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the  \nmeasured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total organic HAP value.  \n This approach is unreasonable as applied to non- detect results. This approach would guarantee \nthat each measurement would result in a total of  at least one third of the standard, even if no \noHAPs were detected at all. Considering that the aggregate standard is already extremely low, EPA\u2019s treatment of non- detects will lead to  erroneous over -estimation and potential false non-\ncompliance results .  \n \nRather, for results below the detection limit, a value of 0 should be used for that HAP , \nsince the HAP was not in fact detected.  Note again , as shown above, that for the 8 oHAPs EPA \nproposes to use in the aggregate  standard , only two were found in more than half of the tests  \nreviewed, and none w as found in all tests. There is no reason to assume that an undetected oHAP \nis present in any test. Using 0 would also be consistent with the method EPA applies in the Proposed Rule  with dioxin/furan congeners that are below the detection limit.\n33 \n  In addition, the definition of \u201cTotal Organic HAP\u201d should not refer to \u201cmethod detec tion \nlevels,\u201d because this is likely to cause confusion. Rather, it should refer to the Representative \n \n33 While NLA believes that zero is the appropriate value to use for non- detects, EPA could, in the alternative, use \none half of the RDL, as it has done in other contexts.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 57 Detection Limits (RDLs) as specified in the table in the preamble.  If EPA declines to use zero for \nnon-detects, then it should include the table of RDLs in the final rule language and  should revise \nthe provision above to read \u201c ...you must use the method detection l evel or the representative \ndetection level (RDL) as listed in Table __, whichever is lower , as the measured emissions level \nfor that pollutant\u2026.\u201d  The lower of these two figures should be used, because the RDL is the \nsource of the standard, and undetected levels should not be presumed to be higher than the RDL.  \n \nDIOXINS/FURANS  \n \nXIX. EPA LACKS SUFFICIENT DATA TO SET A MACT FLOOR FOR DIOXINS AND FURANS , AND SHOULD ISSUE A NEW ICR FOR DIOXIN/FURAN DATA  \n \nEPA proposes to set a MACT floor for dioxins and furans  (D/F)  for all major lime \nsources based on data from only two lime kilns \u2014one with non- detectable amounts of D/F, and \nanother with very low but detectable amounts. EPA rejected all other D/F data submitted by the industry based on determinations that the test methods used were not recognized by EPA , or for \nother technical reasons.  Based on these two data points, EPA proposes to set a MACT floor for \nthe entire industry\u201496 lime kilns \u2014assuming that MACT floor for the industry should be set \nbased on non- detectable amounts of D/F.  \n \nEPA provides no data indicating that the tests from these two lime kilns \u2014either \nindividually or taken together \u2014are representative of the emissions of the lime industry. It is \narbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a standard based on such limited data. Chem.  Mfg.  Ass\u2019n  v \nEPA, 28 F.3d 1259, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (\u201c\u2026we conclude that it was arbitrary and capricious \nfor the EPA to list MDI as a high- risk pollutant solely upon the basis of the RfC for MDI, \nwithout identifying any serious health effect with whic h it has ever been associated\u201d). EPA \nshould withdraw the proposed D/F standard and issue a new Information Collection Request to collect sufficient data to make a statistically valid determination of a proper MACT standard.  \n  Pursuing a new Information Collection Request for D/F would have multiple benefits. \nFirst, and most importantly, it would permit EPA to establish emission standards based on genuinely representative data from the industry. Second, if sufficient results are non -detect, it \nwould assist in  setting a work practice for D/F . Third, comprehensive data may show that \nsubcategories would be appropriate for lime plants emitting D/F, based on type of equipment or type of product being manufactured, as was the case for HCl . \n In the alternative, EPA\u2019s lack of adequate data should support the establishment of a \nwork practice for D/F , as described below . When EPA does not have sufficient HAP data to set a \nnumeric standard, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s promulgation of a non- numeric work \npractice standard. Chesapeake Climate Action Network v. EPA , 952 F.3d 310, 315 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n \nFinally, EPA should consider the alternative of setting no standard for D/F at all  as it did \nin 2004. EPA already established that D/F emissions from lime manufacturing processes are \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 58 negligible.34 Accordingly, such emissions are de minimis , and do not require an emissions \nstandard. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle , 636 F.2d 323, 400 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (describing EPA\u2019s \ndiscretion to exempt certain de minimis  releases from regulation under the Clean Air Act).  Such \na standard is clearly not \u201cnecessary\u201d under the terms of the LEAN  decision and the Clean Air \nAct. \n \nXX. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, EPA SHOULD SET T HE WORK PRACTICE \nSTANDARD FOR DIOXINS/FURANS  PROPOSED BY NLA  \n \nDuring the development of the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA repeatedly and \nconsistently informed NLA that it was planning to issue a work practice for dioxins and furans, \nbecause, according to EPA, it had D/F data showing that more than 55% of test results were non-detect, thus permitting EPA to establish a work practice. NLA and EPA had multiple discussions on the form a work practice would take, and NLA submitted a suggested work practice. See  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. NLA noted that due to the extremely low D/F \nemissions, an appropriate work practice would require sources to properly operate the air pollution control devices already in place to control particulate matter. However, in both the January 2023 Proposed Rule  and the new Proposed Rule , EPA proposed to set a MACT floor \nbased on data from a single lime kiln. In the new Proposed Rule, EPA requests  comment on a \npotential work practice. \n NLA continues to believe that EPA should apply the work practice previously submitted \nby NL A in EPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015-0090 and attachment. Considering that EPA has already \nfound that risks from dioxin and furan emissions are acceptable with an ample margin of safety, and that D/F emissions are extremely low, a practice requiring sources to properly maintain existing air pollution control devices is sufficient to ensure that risks from D/F emissions remain low.\n35 \n XXI. EPA SHOULD PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANCE METHOD FOR \nDIOXINS AND FURANS  \n \nNLA continues to believe that the work practice it previously suggested should be \nadopted by EPA. However, if EPA chooses not to provide a work practice, NLA suggests that EPA  set an alternative method of complying with the numerical standard by allowing an \nappropriate inlet temperature to the air pollution control device (APCD) to be set on a site -\n \n34 See EPA Docket No. A- 95-41, Item No.  II-B-121. (\u201cEmissions of dioxin and furan congeners are well -\ndocumented but are shown to be emitted in extremely small quantities; therefore, dioxin and furan data were not \ncollected in this search.\u201d)  \n35 NLA has not included its suggested work practice language in the \u201cblueline,\u201d because EPA previously declined to \nadopt  this work practice. However, if EPA decides to include the work practice, the relevant rule language would \nstate that \u201c Lime kilns operators, as an indicator of good kiln operation, will comply with Lime MACT PMCD  \noperating requirements at all times. For lime kilns with a fabric filter (FF) or an electro -static precipitator (ESP) , \ncomply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements which serve to affirm good operating practices, and f or lime kilns with \na wet scrubber comply with Tables 1, 2, and 5 requirements including continuous performance levels for flow and \npressure drop and flow rate which continuously assures good operation is occurring. \u201d \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 59 specific basis . This is due to the wide variety of gas temperatures entering the various APCD and \nthe variety of kiln/APCD configurations.36  \nThis approach is justified because compliance testing combined with a site -specific \ntemperature (i.e., inlet to APCD temperature) would ensure that each plant\u2019s configuration and \ntemperature parameters result in D/F emissions that meet the numeric standard. Compliance with the site -specific temperature should be on a 30-day rolling average. If annual compliance testing \nfor a period of three years shows the lime plant meets the numeric standard and the temperature requirement is met, then the lime plant shou ld be allowed to discontinue stack testing for D/F \nand show compliance through the parametric temperature requirement alone.  \nThis temperature -based approach would be a parametric way of implementing the 0.037 \nng/dscm standard. Therefore, the temperature-based approach is not a work practice, and measuring 0.037 with a stack test or measuring site -specific temperature would be alternative \nmeans of complying with the same numerical standard. (NLA would like to emphasize that this \napproach should only be set as an alternative means of compliance to periodic stack testing, and \nnot the sole means of compliance, because some lime plant s will be able to meet the numeric \nstandard without temperature control, and other plants may have to employ controls other than temperature controls to meet the numerical standard .) \nNLA suggests adding the following language to Table 6, Line 22: \nAs an alternative compliance method to the performance testing specified above, a source may \nperform annual testing for a period of three years  to establish a site -specific temperature of \ngases entering the inlet to the air pollution control device at which the numerical standard for dioxins/furans is met. Subsequently the source may rely on parametric temperature monitoring  \non a 30-day rolling average, and further performance testing is not required. \n \nXXII.  D/F\u2014REQUIRED TECHNICAL CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nIf EPA chooses to promulgate a numerical emissions standard for dioxins and furans, the \nfollowing technical corrections should be made. \n \nA. EPA Has Properly  Corrected  the Proposed D/F E missions B ased on EPA\u2019s \nProposed D/F T esting R equirements.   \n In the January 2023 Proposed Rule, EPA proposed a limit on D/F based on EPA\u2019s \nJohnson memo.\n37 To properly utilize Reference Image 4 -3 to obtain a limit, the stack gas sample \nvolume, in dry standard cubic meter (dscm), is required to select the appropriate 3xRDL value. NLA pointed out in comments that EPA\u2019s proposed D/F limit was  set incorrectly in that it \n \n36 These variations are also the reason no temperature -based work practice has been identified that  would be \npracticable for the lime industry.  \n37 See Reference Image 4 -3: EPA Docket Item: EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0117.

EPA has recognized this issue and  has corrected the D/F limit to  0.037 ng/dscm  \nin the 2024 Proposed Rule . NLA commends EPA for this correction.  \n \nB. The TEF in Table 1 1 of the Proposed Rule  Redline  and EPA\u2019s 2010 TEF \nDocket D ocument D o Not M atch.   \n \nIn the preamble  to the new Proposed Rule , EPA states the following:  \n \nAdditionally, the EPA is incorporating by reference EPA/100/R \u2013 10/005, \n\u2018\u2018Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) for Human Health Risk \nAssessments of 2, 3, 7, 8 - Tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like Compounds,\u2019\u2019 \nDecember 2010, which is the s ource of the toxicity equivalence factors (TEF) for dioxins \nand furans used in calculating the toxic equivalence quotient of the proposed dioxin and furan standard.  \n \n89 Fed. Reg. 9103.  \n \nTable 2 of the December 2010 document  referenced in the preamble provides the \nrecommended TEFs for D/F that are apparently incorporated by reference. However, Table 11 in  \nthe Proposed Rule  redline contains incorrect  TEF factors  from 1989. This disparity could create \nconfusion in future testing for D/F and should be corrected.\n \n \nAlso note that in the definitions section of the docket redline ( \u00a763.7143), the definition of \nTEQ refers to Table 10, when it should refer to Table 11.38 \n \nCOMMENTS ON MONITORING  \n \nAs noted above , NLA supports EPA\u2019s decision to base monitoring on periodic stack \ntesting and parametric monitoring. However, some adjustments to the proposed parametric \nmonitoring are needed.  \n XXIII.  EPA SHOULD MODIFY PARAMETRIC MONITORING REQUIREMENTS  \nFOR PERIODS OF STARTUP  AND SHUTDOWN  \nThe Proposed Rule  requires sources to comply with emissions  limits  and operating limits \nat all times , except during startup and shutdown as indicated in Table 2 of the docket redline . \nEven though NLA endorse s the use of periodic stack test and parametric monitoring to \ndemonstrate continuous compliance, the Proposed Rule  does not appropriately address how \noperating limits will be met during lime kiln startup or shutdown  for kilns using dry sorbent \ninjection , ACI or thermal oxidizers . During these periods, sorbent and carbon cannot be injected \nat the same rates as during normal operations , and operating conditions for RTOs differ as well . \n \n \n38 Note that if Table 9, referring to emissions averaging, is deleted as NLA suggests, the TEQ table would again be \nTable 10.  EPA should make sure the definition reference is consistent with the table number.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 61 NLA requests that EPA add the following (new) language to Table 2  to address \napplicable operating limits in the Proposed Rule s during startup and shutdown. \n \n5. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use dry \nsorbent injection or carbon injection during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 operating limits for sorbent and/or carbon injection do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that sorbent or carbon injection is in operation until the uni t is no \nlonger in startup or shutdown. During startup and shutdown, the control device shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating \nprocedure for startup and shutdown events. \n \n6. All new and existing \nlime kilns that use a thermal oxidizer during startup and shutdown   When a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown (as defined in section \n63.7143), the Table 3 temperature limits for a thermal oxidizer do not apply and the lime kiln operator shall ensure that the thermal oxidizer is in operation until the unit is no longer in startup or shutdown.\n During startup and shutdown, the control \ndevice shall be operated in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations or by a site -specific operating procedure for \nstartup and shutdown events. \n \n \nXXIV.  EPA SHOULD PERMIT USE OF APPROVED MONITORING APPROACHES (SUCH AS BAG LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS ) DURING STARTUP AND \nSHUTDOWN  \n In the 2020 Lime MACT RTR rulemaking, EPA incorporated new requirements for \nstartup and shutdown of kilns as it related to existing visible emissions standards  for PM . \nHowever, the final rulemaking did not specify how kilns already using approved monitoring systems other than continuous opacity monitoring systems  (COMS ), such as bag leak detection \nsystems (BLDS), during normal operations should comply during startup and shutdown events.  \n \nKilns in the lime industry have used BLDS  (and other approved methods)  for continuous \ncompliance standards under the Lime MACT since its original inception in lieu of COMS. EPA, however, in several  instances, has disapproved applications for Alternative Monitoring \napproaches  proposing that a BLDS, like a COM, be allowed during s tartup/ shutdown events. \nEPA should clarify this issue now and should make it clear that a n approved method such as \nBLDS may be used during s tartup/ shutdown events as they are allowed for use under normal \noperation. Therefore, NLA request s that  the following provision be added to \u00a763.7090(c) of the \nregulation to clearly authorize use of these methods  during s tartup/ shutdown events : \n \nWhen a lime kiln is in startup or shutdown, a lime kiln may use any method approved for use \nto show continuous compliance during normal operations (such as a bag leak detection system) to demonstrate proper operation of the baghouse as a surrogate to demonstrating compliance with visible emission limits during these events.  \n \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 62 XXV.  EPA SHOULD ADJUST LANGUAGE IN \u00a763.7113 \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (h)(2) and (3) of the redline, EPA, in reference to monitors used to measure \ninjection rates, states that the device should be installed and calibrated \u201cin accordance with the \nmanufacturer's procedures and specifications.\u201d In some cases, manufacturers\u2019 procedures and specifications are unavailable or out of date, or  are otherwise incomplete or inapplicable. NLA \nrequests that EPA add the phrase \u201cor other applicable procedures  (such as industry standards or \nbest practices)  to ensure proper operation of the  device. \u201d \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (i)(3), EPA states that \u201c The calibration reference for the temperature \nmeasurement must be a National Institute of Standards and Technology calibrated reference \nthermocouple -potentiometer system or alternate reference, subject to approval by the \nAdministrator .\u201d NLA notes that it would be preferable for this section to call for  the \nmeasurement to be \u201ccalibrated to a National Institute of Standards and Technology traceable \ncertified reference thermocouple,\u201d because such traceable certified reference thermocouples are more readily available.  \n \nIn \u00a763.7113 (4), the term \u201cand other temperature sensors\u201d should be deleted. NLA is not \naware of temperature sensors other than thermocouples in use in this application. \n \nXXVI.  EPA SHOULD ADD CLARFYING LANGUAGE TO \u00a763.711 2(d) \n \nIn \u00a763.7112(d) , EPA adds language on test runs for performance tests. NLA believes that \nthe language on test duration could cause some confusion, and recommends that EPA revise the \nlast sentence in the section to read \u201cEach test run must last at least 1 hour for PM testing or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM.\u201d Alternatively, EPA could incorporate the 1 hour test run requirement for PM testing into Table 5 (as with the duration \nrequirement for other HAPs), and simply revise the language in (d) to \u201cThe duration of each test run shall be as specified in Table 5 to this subpart.\u201d  \n \nADDITIONAL COMMENTS  AND CORRECTIONS  \n \nXXVII.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT THE EQUATION FOR CALCULATING HCl \nAND MERCURY LBS/TON OF LIME PRODUCED EMISSION RATES  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposed redline text includes Equation 4 in Section 63.7112(n) to calculate the \nHCl and Hg emission rates in pounds  per ton of lime produced for HCl and pounds  per million \ntons of lime produced for Hg.  The equation is  stated in the redline  as follows : \n \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58+ \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)\n\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c   where,  \n \nE = Emission rate of mercury, pounds per million tons (lb/MMton) of lime produced or \nHCl per ton (lb/ton) of lime produced  \n Ck = Concentration in the kiln effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd)  \n Qk = Volumetric flow rate of kiln gas effluent (dscf/hr)  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 63 Qc = Volumetric flow rate of cooler effluent gas, dscf/hr. This value is zero if there is not \na separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nCc = Concentration in the cooler effluent of mercury (\u00b5g/dscf) or HCl (ppmvd).  This \nvalue is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \nP = Stone production rate (ton/hr) for HCl and (MMton/hr) for Hg. K = Conversion factor, for mercury 2.2 x 10\n-9 \u00b5g/lb.  For HCl 9.20 x 10-8 ppmvd HCl per \nlb/dscf HCl.  \n Careful review of this equation  has determined that the conversion factor units for HCl and \nmercury are incorrect.  Also, as noted in section IX above, calculation of HAP emission rates \nfrom coolers other than PM is unnecessary and should be deleted. Therefore, t o calculate the \ncorrect emission rate, the follow revisions should be made to the equation: \n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38=  \ud835\udc72\ud835\udc72(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58)\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c    where,  \nK = Conversion factor \nMercury conversion factor = 2.2 x 10-9 lb/\u00b5g . \nHCl conversion factor = 9.20 x 10-8 lb/dscf HCl per ppmvd HCl . \nOther terms are as defined above. \n The corrected equation  includes K in the numerator, not the denominator, emissions rate \ncalculations from coolers have been dropped, and conversion factor units have been corrected. \nEPA should update equation 4 accordingly. Note: If EPA sets an HBEL for HCl, this formula \nwould not be necessary for HCl, and would apply only to mercury.  \n \nXXVIII.  EPA SHOULD PROVIDE THAT TESTING TO RESET OPERATING \nLIMITS DOES NOT VIOLATE STANDARDS   \n \nThe Proposed Rule states that operating limits must be complied with at all times  (except \nto a limited extent  during startup and shutdown). However, operators when seeking to reset \noperating limits require the ability to reset at the appropriate level at the time of the test, which \nmay be at a different  level than the prior operating limit. The rule should clarify that a source is \nallowed to deviate from an existing operating limit when conducting a subsequent engineering evaluation or performance test. The rule should include the following language in \u00a763.7100 (a), and in  the definition of \u201cDeviation\u201d in 63.7143: \n \nHowever, when a lime kiln emissions control device is being evaluated for engineering \npurposes or for performance testing purposes, the existing operating limits for the control device do not apply and variance from current operating limits is not a deviation. \n \n \nXXIX.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT LANGUAGE REFERRING TO SCRUBBERS  \n \nThe Proposed Rule misconstrues the difference between a PM (typically venturi) type \nscrubber and a WPTGA used to control acid gases which a lime kiln may need to install to \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 64 comply with the new requirements of this rulemaking. This apparently led EPA to erroneously \ndelete some references to PM in the rule language, when those references are intended to make \nclear that the provisions refer to scrubbers used to control PM. EPA should clarify the Proposed \nRule  by retaining all references to PM scrubbers in the existing rule language  and ensure that \nreferences to setting parameter limits for PM scrubbers or acid gas scrubbers explicitly state that establishing operating parameters only apply when conducting performance tests for the specific \npollutant being measured.  \n \nFor example, in Table 5, lines 8, 9, 14, and 15, deleting the scrubber flow rate reference \nto PM could imply that the PM scrubber flow rate requirement is to be reset for a performance \ntest of any regulated HAP in the rule when it should only apply when completing a PM limit \nperformance test.  The same is the case for Table 3 lines 2 and 4, and Table 6 lines 1 and 3. The \nreference to PM should be retained in each of those provisions . \n \nXXX.  IN TABLE 5, ROW 6, THERE IS A REFER ENC E \u201cREFER TO NOTE 1\u201d THAT \nAPPEARS TO BE INCORRECT  \n \nRow  6 on Table 5 (addressing PM) in the docket redline includes, in the third column, the \nreference \u201cRefer to Note 1.\u201d Note 1 , however, relates to utilizing ASTM D6384- 12e1 for HCl \nand organic testing  and does not appear to be relevant to Row 6. The reference in Row 6 should \nbe corrected or deleted.  \n \nXXXI.  EPA SHOULD SIMPLIFY THE DEFINTION OF DRY SORBENT INJECTION \n \nThe definition of dry sorbent injection in \u00a763.7143 refers to use of this technology \u201c to \nreact with and neutralize acid gases (such as SO2 and HCl), Hg, organic HAP, or dioxin furans .\u201d \nNLA believes that this language should be simplified to refer only to HAPs being regulated in this rule, and thus should read \u201c\u201dto react with and neutralize HCl, Hg, organic HAP, or dioxins and furans.\u201d  \n \nXXXII.  EPA SHOULD REVISE TABLE S 3, 4 AND 6 TO INCLUDE PARALLEL \nLANGUAGE ON REQUIREMENTS  AND TO CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS.  \n \nLine 7 of Table 3 in the redline  should be revised to require \u201c flow rate greater than or \nequal to the flow rate operating limit,\u201d to parallel similar language in Line 8.  \n Table 3, Lines 7 and 8 should be revised to add the words \u201c for the applicable pollutant\u201d \nto the end to reflect  that not all pollutants will necessarily be tested in each performance test.  \nSimilarly, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should be added to Table 4, Line 1, before the term \u201cperformance test.\u201d In Table 6, Lines 7 and 8, the word \u201capplicable\u201d should also be added before \nthe term \u201cperformance test.\u201d (These suggested changes are shown in the NLA \u201cblueline.\u201d)  \n \nXXXIII.  TABLE 5 SHOULD BE REVISED FOR CLARITY \n \nTable 5, Line 20, should be revised to make clear that there are different required test \ndurations for different test methods . See the NLA blueline for suggested language.  \n                                                                 Comments of the National Lime Association on EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015  \nPage 65  \nXXXIV.  EPA SHOULD CORRECT A TYPO IN TABLE 4  \n \nTable 4, Line  1 refers to measuring mercury using \u201cMethod 29 or 30B 5D in appendix A \nto part 60\u201d and measuring Total Organic HAP \u201cusing Method 18 5D in appendix A to part 60\u201d.  \nIn both cases the use of 5D appears to be a typographical error and should be deleted. \n \nCONCLUSION  \nNLA appreciates the opportunity to comment on these important issues.   \nVery truly yours,  \n \n William C.

The general  duty to minimize  emissions  does not require the owner or operator to \nmake any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring \nresults, review of operation and  maintenance  procedures,  review  of operation and maintenance records,  \nand inspection  of the source.  \n(d) You must prepare and implement for each LMP,  a written  operations, maintenance,  and \nmonitoring (OM&M) plan. You must submit the plan to the applicable permitting authority for \nreview and approval as part of the application for a 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 permit.

Beginning [DATE OF  PUBLICATION \nOF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], each performance test must include \nthe methods specified in rows 19-24 of Table 5 to this subpart . Performance tests for the \nemission standards promulgated in this rule , including PM emission standards and emissions \nstandards added on [DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THE FINAL RULE IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER] are not required to be performed at the same time.  On and after the relevant \ncompliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), each performance test must be \nconducted based on representative performance (i.e., performance based on normal operating \nconditions) of the affected source and under the specific conditions in Table 5 to this subpart. \nRepresentative conditions exclude periods of sta rtup and shutdown. The owner or operator may not  \nconduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator  must  record the process \ninformation that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include  in such record  \nan explanation to support that such conditions represent  normal operation. Upon request, the owner or \noperator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the \nconditions of performance tests. \n(c) Prior to the relevant compliance date for your source as specified in \u00a763.7083( eg), you \nmay not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as \nspecified  in \u00a763.7(e)(1).

Each  test run must last \nat least 1 hour for PM testing  or as specified in Table 5 to this subpart for HAPs other than PM . \n13  \n \n (e) The emission rate of particulate matter (PM) from each lime kiln (and each lime cooler \nif there is a separate exhaust  to the atmosphere  from  the lime cooler)  must  be computed for each \nrun using Equation 1 of this section:  \n \nWhere:  \nE = Emission rate  of PM, pounds  per ton (lb/ton)  of stone feed.  \nCk = Concentration of  PM in  the kiln effluent, grain/dry standard  cubic  feet (gr/dscf).  \nQk = Volumetric  flow  rate of  kiln effluent  gas, dry standard  cubic feet  per hour (dscf/hr).  \n \nCc = Concentration of PM in the cooler  effluent,  grain/dscf. This value  is zero  if there  is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n \nQc = Volumetric  flow rate of cooler  effluent  gas, dscf/hr.  This value  is zero if there is not a \nseparate cooler exhaust to the atmosphere.  \n P = Stone  feed rate,  tons  per hour (ton/hr).  \n \nK = Conversion factor, 7000 grains  per pound (grains/lb).  \n \n(f)(1) If you choose to meet a weighted average emission limit as specified in item 4 of \nTable 1 to this subpart, you must  calculate a combined particulate  emission  rate from  all kilns \nand coolers within your LMP using Equation 2 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \n \nET = Emission rate  of PM from  all kilns and coolers,  lb/ton of  stone feed.  \nEi = Emission  rate of PM from  kiln i, or from  kiln/cooler  combination i, lb/ton of stone  feed. \nPi = Stone feed rate to kiln i, ton/hr.  \nn = Number of  kilns you wish to  include  in averaging. \n \n(2) You do not have  to include  every  kiln in this calculation,  only include  kilns  you wish  to \n\n14  \n \n average. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(g) The weighted  average PM emission  limit from  all kilns  and coolers  for which  you are \naveraging must be calculated using Equation 3 of this section:  \n \n \nWhere:  \nETN = Weighted  average PM  emission  limit  for all kilns  and coolers  being included in averaging \nat the LMP, lb/ton of stone feed.  \nEj = PM emission  limit (0.10 or 0.12)  for kiln j, or for kiln/cooler  combination j, lb/ton  of stone \nfeed.  \nPj = Stone  feed rate to  kiln j, ton/hr.  \nm = Number of kilns and kiln/cooler combinations you are averaging at your LMP. You must \ninclude  the same kilns  in the calculation  of ET and ETN. Kilns  that have  a PM emission \nlimit of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.  \n(h) Performance  test results  must  be documented in complete  test reports  that contain  the \ninformation required by paragraphs (h)(1) through (10) of this section, as well as all other \nrelevant information. The plan to be followed during testing must be made available to the Administrator at least 60 days prior to testing.  \n(1) A brief  description of  the process  and the  air pollution  control system;  \n(2) Sampling  location  description(s);  \n \n(3) A description of sampling  and analytical  procedures  and any modifications  to standard \nprocedures;  \n(4) Test results, including opacity;  \n \n(5) Quality  assurance procedures  and results;  \n \n(6) Records  of operating conditions  during the test, preparation  of standards,  and calibration \n\n15  \n \n procedures;  \n(7) Raw data sheets  for field  sampling  and field  and laboratory analyses;  \n \n(8) Documentation of calculations;  \n \n(9) All data recorded and  used to establish operating limits; and  \n \n(10) Any other information  required by the test method. \n \n(i) [Reserved]  \n \n(j) You must establish any applicable 3-hour block average operating limit indicated in \nTable 3 to this subpart according  to the applicable requirements  in Table 4  to this subpart and \nparagraphs (j)(1) through (4) of this section. \n(1) Continuously record  the parameter  during the PM performance  test and include the  \n \nparameter  record(s) in the performance test report.  \n \n(2) Determine  the average  parameter  value for  each 15 -minute  period of each test  run. \n \n(3) Calculate the test run average for the parameter  by taking the average of all  the 15- \nminute parameter values for the run. \n(4) Calculate the 3-hour operating limit by taking the average of the three test  run averages.  \n \n(k) For each building enclosing any PSH operations that is subject  to a VE limit,  you must \nconduct a VE check according to item 18 in Table 5 to this subpart, and in accordance with \nparagraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section. \n(1) Conduct visual inspections that consist of a visual survey of the building over the test \nperiod to identify if there are VE, other than condensed water vapor. \n(2) Select  a position at least 15 but not more  1,320 feet from  each  side of the building with \nthe sun or other light source generally at your back. \n(3) The observer conducting the VE checks  need  not be certified  to conduct EPA  Method 9 \nin appendix A-4 to part 60 of this chapter. However, the observer must meet the training \n16  \n \n requirements as described in EPA Method 22 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. \n(l) When  determining  compliance with the opacity standards for fugitive emissions  from \nPSH operations in item 8 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must conduct EPA Method 9 in \nappendix A-4 to  part 60 of this  chapter  according  to item 17 in  Table 5 to  this subpart, and  in \naccordance with paragraphs (l)(1) through (3) of this section.  \n(1) The minimum distance between  the observer  and the emission  source shall  be 4.57 \nmeters (15 feet).  \n(2) The observer shall, when possible, select a position that minimizes interference from \nother fugitive emission  sources  (e.g., road  dust). The required  observer position  relative  to the \nsun must be followed. \n(3) If you use wet dust suppression to control PM from PSH operations, a visible mist is \nsometimes  generated  by the spray. The  water  mist must not be confused with  particulate  matter \nemissions  and is not to be considered VE. When  a water  mist of this nature is present,  you must \nobserve emissions at a point in the plume where the mist is no longer visible. \n(m) On and after the relevant  compliance date for your source as specified  in \u00a763.7083( eg), \nduring startup, kilns must  be tested hourly to determine when lime product meets the definition \nof on-specification lime product. \n(n) An LMP may document that the sitewide HCl potential to emit from all  lime kilns is \nbelow 300 tpy and submit this with a  Notice of Compliance Status (NOCS)  before the \ncompliance date. The potential to emit shall be documented by completing a performance test \non each lime kiln, developing an emission factor in units of pound per ton of lime produced multiplied by annual maximum lime production rate for each kiln, and summing the HCl for all kilns at the site. If the LMP includes any kilns requiring add-on controls to comply with the HBEL, the operator shall develop and set a minimum DSI injection rate (or other operating \n17  \n \n parameter for other controls) for kilns that will continuously operate controls to maintain \ncompliance with the HBEL.

The exhaust  may be \nan open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a combination of such features.  \nOn-specification  Lime  Product  means  lime product  that has been  sufficiently  calcined  to \nmeet end use requirements.  \nParticulate  matter  (PM) detector  means  a system  that is continuously capable of monitoring \nPM loading in the exhaust of FF or ESP in order to detect bag leaks, upset conditions, or control device malfunctions and sounds an alarm at a  preset level. A PM detector system includes, but is \nnot limited  to, an  instrument  that operates  on triboelectric,  light  scattering,  light  transmittance,  or \nother effects to continuously monitor relative particulate loadings. A BLDS is a type of PM detector.  \n52  \n \n Positive  pressure  FF or ESP  means  a FF or ESP with  the fan(s) on the upstream  side of the \ncontrol device. \nProcess stone handling operations means the equipment and transfer points between the \nequipment used to transport processed stone, and includes, storage bins, conveying system \ntransfer  points, bulk loading or unloading systems,  screening  operations, bucket elevators,  and \nbelt conveyors. \nProcessed  stone means  limestone  or other calcareous  material  that has been  processed  to a \nsize suitable for feeding into a lime kiln.  \nScreening operation means a device for separating material according to size by passing \nundersize material  through one or more  mesh  surfaces  (screens)  in series  and retaining  oversize \nmaterial on the mesh surfaces (screens).  \nShutdown means  the cessation  of kiln operation. Shutdown begins when  feed to the kiln is \nreduced below planned production quantities and ends when stone feed is halted and fuel \ncombustion from the main burner ceases. \nStack emissions means  the PM that is released  to the atmosphere from  a capture system  or \ncontrol device. \nStartup means  the beginning of kiln operation. Startup  begins when  a shutdown kiln begins \nfiring fuel in the main burner. Startup ends when the lime kiln first generates on- specification \nlime product or 12 hours following first discharge from the kiln, whichever is earlier. \nStone produced refers  to the production of limestone  from  the lime kiln consisting of high- \ncalcium quick lime, dolomitic quick lime and/or dead burned dolomitic lime.  \nStorage bin means  a manmade enclosure for storage (including surge bins) of processed \nstone prior to the lime kiln.  \nTEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity equivalents for dioxins and \n53  \n \n furans as defined in EPA/100/R-10/005, \u201c Recommended Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEFs) \nfor Human Health Risk Assessments of 2, 3, 7, 8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and Dioxin- Like \nCompounds \u201d, December  2010 (incorporated by reference\u2014see  \u00a763.14). The Toxic Equivalency \nFactors (TEFs) used to determine the dioxin and furan TEQs are listed in Table 10 of this \nsubpart.  \nTotal Organic HAP  means,  for the purposes of this subpart, the sum of the concentrations of \ncompounds of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, benzene, m-xylene, p-xylene, o-xylene, styrene, ethyl benzene, and naphthalene as measured by EPA Test Method 320 or Method 18 of appendix A to this part or ASTM D6348\u201303[1] or a combination of these methods, as appropriate. If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection  \nlevel (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), a value of zero (0) should be used you must use the \nmethod detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total \norganic HAP value. The measured  result  for a multiple  component analysis  (e.g., analytical  \nvalues  for multiple  Method 18 fractions) may include a combination of method detection level \ndata and analytical data reported above th e method detection level. The owner or operator of an \naffected source may request the use of other test methods to make this determination under paragraphs 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f) of this part.  \nTransfer point means  a point in a conveying operation where the material  is transferred  to \nor from a belt conveyor. \nVent means an opening through which there is mechanically induced air flow for the \npurpose of exhausting from  a building air carrying  PM emissions  from  one or more  emission \nunits. \n \n54  \n \n Table 1 to  Subpart  AAAAA of Part  63\u2014Emission Limits  \nAs required  in \u00a763.7090(a), you must meet  each emission  limit in the following  table  that \napplies to you, except for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown (See Table 2 for \nemission limits for kilns and coolers during startup and shutdown). \n \nFor . . .

If, at  any time \nafter January 5, 2004, the kiln changes to a dry control \nsystem, then the PM emission limit in item 1 of this \nTable  1 applies,  and the kiln is hereafter  ineligible  for the \nPM emission limit in item 2 of this Table 1 regardless of \nthe method of PM control.  \n3. All nNew lime kilns and their \nassociated lime coolers  PM emissions  must  not exceed  0.10 lb/tsf.  \n4.

It is found in household products such as \ncleaners and swimming pool additives and is formed during the burning of many plastics.  HCl is \nconsidered one of the most important ba sic industrial chemicals.  Mean air exposure to HCl in \noccupational settings has been estimated by IARC as ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 \nduring acid treatment of metals , while m ean exposures during other industrial processes are \nestimated as >1 mg/m3. Ambient air levels of HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3. \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulf uric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl was that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore assessed \nexposure to HCl as not classifiable as to it s carcinogenicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d).  \nBecause of its wide uses in industry, tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied and no clear signals of elevated cancer risks have emerged. This is despite the fact that \nmany individua ls classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that \nincluded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists.  When exposures are mixed, \nthe substance contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome  (e.g., \nsulfuric acid in mixed acid mists) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. Mixed \nexposures or chance are the likely explanation s for the sporadic  positive associations with cancer \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containin g HCl.  All occupational epidemiology \nstudies published since the 1992 IARC  determination are consistent with this conclusion.  \nThe available toxicological evidence also is consistent with the human data, i.e., it does not \nindicate that HCl is carcinogenic or mutagenic, and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types \nof cell proliferation that are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens . The only chronic \nexposure study  reported increased  incidence of  hyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferatio n) in the \nlarynx and trachea of rats exposed to 10 ppm HCl as compared to controls , but no excess cancer \nwas observed.  Hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure \nconcentrations below the threshold at which hyperplasia was reported. Two  short term cancer \nstudies in experimental animals reported that neither dermal nor oral exposures resulted in an \nincrease in cancers.  The available toxicology studies also did not provide evidence of genotoxicity \nor mutagenicity resulting fro m HCl exposures (as reviewed by Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development). Furthermore, in studies where HCl was administered along with \nformaldehyde, exposures to 10 ppm HCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d \nthe carcinoge nicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for their risk assessment is expected to contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n2 HCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n1.INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (i.e., it is an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. The gas form may be designated as \nHCl(g) , and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air   (IARC 1992; ATSDR 2014; National Library of Medicine (US), National Center for \nBiotechnology Information 2024; ATSDR 2002) . On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white \nvapors due to condensation with atmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into \ncontact with moisture, it forms hydrochloric acid. Commercial concentrated hydrochloric acid  \ncontains 36% to 38% hydrogen chloride in water.  \nIn the early twentieth century, hydrogen chloride was created by burning hydrogen gas. This \nmethod created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between chloride salts and \nsulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC 1992) . A widely used industrial chemical,  HCl can \nalso be formed as a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in industrial manufacturing \nprocesses, for e xample from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime (CaO and MgO)  (IARC 1992; \nATSDR 2014; ATSDR 2002) . HCl can also  be found in many everyday products, including \nhousehold products such as cleaners and swimming pool additives (used to adjust the pH), and it \nis formed during the burning of many plastics.  Industrial uses of HCl include pickling, \nelectroplating metals, tanni ng leather, cleaning, and the production of a wide variety of products . \nHCl is also formed naturally in events like volcano eruptions. HCl is one of the most widely used \nchemicals in industrial processes , and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n(OSHA ) estimates that about 1,239,000 American workers are potentially exposed to HCl (as \ncited in IARC 1992) . People are exposed to HCl in the ambient air , although concentrations  are \ntypically below 0.01 mg/m3 (as cited in IARC 1992) . \nBased on communication wit h the National Lime Association (personal communication), HCl \nemitted from lime kilns controlled with a dry air pollution control device (APCD) is in the vapor \n(gas) phase. This is because the gas exit temperature (~400 degrees F) is well above any \nthresho ld where acid mist could exist 0F1. This has been verified with industry stack test data \nobtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing, which confirm the presence of HCl as a \ngas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are controlled with dry \nAPCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions in the form of mists are expected \nto be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water.  \n1.2 Residual Risk , Technology Review , and Health -Based Exposure Limits  \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US -EPA) regulates \n1 As we discuss later, the carcinogenicity evidence for acids involves acid mists specifically . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n3 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022In the first  stage,  section 112(d) requires the US-EPA to develop technology -based\nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each\ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) . 1F2\n\u2022In the second stage, US-EPA is required under section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and\nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If\nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of\nsafety or to prevent an adverse environmental effect, US-EPA must develop  standards to\naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as\nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US-EPA issued MACT\nstandards, the residual risk stage must be completed within eight years of promulgation\nof the  initial technology -based standard .\nUnder section 112(d)(6), US-EPA also must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight yea rs and revise them, as necessary, taking into account developments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US-EPA will revise the rule s. For efficiency, the US-EPA includ es the \n112(f) and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory package and calls the rulemakings the Risk \nand Technology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US-EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is ba sed on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emi ssions information).\u201d  \nAs outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based \nthreshold, assuming such a threshold has been established. The US-EPA will not approve a \nhealth -based threshold for a MACT standard if a HAP is a  carcinogen.  As part of the statutory \nlime manufacturing risk and technology review, US-EPA conducted an inhalation risk assessment \nfor HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and found no unacceptable human health risk \nunder worst case emissions scen arios ( 84 FR 48,723 (Sep. 16, 2019) ). The US-EPA risk \nassessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a variety of human -health risk \nscreening benchmarks as part of risk calculations.  \nIn its pre -proposed rule announced in the February 9, 2024 Federal Register (Vol 89, No. 28), \nUS-EPA requested public comment on a potential health -based exposure limit (HBEL) for HCl. To \nregulate  exposure levels using an HBEL, the chemical in question must be identified as a non -\ncarcinogen . The specific scientific issues that the National Lime Association requested Ramboll to \nconsider are as follows:  \n1.Evidence  related to the potential carcinogenicity of HCl .\n2.Whether  the scientific community has judged there to be an established threshold for\nhealth effects  associated with HCl exposure .\n3.The estimated margin of safety associated with the proposed threshold .\n2 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n4 2.METHODS\n2.1 General a pproach  \nRambo ll review ed and synthesize d the scientific literature regarding the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nand provided a report to NLA in June 2021 . Our 2021 assessment of HCl carcinogenicity \nincorporated previous assessments by  the World Health Organization Internationa l Agency for \nResearch on Cancer ( IARC), the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n(OECD ), and the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) that we updated with \ninformation identified through literature search es to identify information available after the \npublication dates for those agency reports . We concluded that the newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence , and, t aking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  As a follow -up to \nRamboll\u2019s June 2021 report, Ramboll has undertaken the following activities:  \n1.To comment on the evidence related to  the potential for HCl to be a carcinogen,  we\nconducted new searches of the literature to identify any assessments of the risks\nassociated with HCl exposure that had been conducted by authoritative bodies  or that\nhad been published in individual research s tudies since January 2021. This time interval\ndeliberately overlaps with the period covered in Ramboll\u2019s previous review, in order to\nidentify material published in early 2021 whose indexing had been delayed.  We reviewed\nall new information to determine if  it provided evidence in conflict with our prior\nconclusions, or if it supported our prior conclusions.\n2.After incorporating new information into our prior assessment of the evidence, we\nabstracted all quantitative exposure data we identified to date  (i.e., including sources\nidentified for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report)  to determine if there was evidence for a threshold\nbelow which health effects were not observed  (no observed adverse effect level\n[NOAEL ]/lowest observed adverse effect level [LOAEL]). We documented this\ninformation, along with any specific health -related  outcomes investigated in association\nwith these exposure levels.\n3.We developed comments on the quality, quantity, and certainty of the evid ence thus\nsummarized , and discussed the ability to consider the conclusions  regarding a threshold\nfor health effects to be \u201cestablished\u201d .\n4.To comment on the estimated margin of safety in US -EPA\u2019s pre -proposed rule, we\nreview ed US-EPA air modeling methods to  verify the ir methods and underlying\nassumptions were scientifically supported . In addition, we r eviewed the calculations and\nassumptions underlying the reference concentration values (RfC) estimated by California\nEPA and US -EPA to determine which  approach  was more appropriate .\n2.2 Identifying Relevant Literature \nWe implemented the same search strategies documented in Ramboll\u2019s  June 2021 report to NLA \nto verify that we were able to identify the same body of relevant literature cited in 2021 and to \nupdate those searches with material published between 2021 and February 2024. We enhanced \nboth literature search es as described in section 2.2.2  and 2.2.3, below .  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n5 2.2.1  Updated assessments of HCl by authoritative bodies  \nWe checked for HCl assessments by the following authoritative bodies , focusing on material \npublished since 2021 : IARC, OECD, IPCS , the US Environmental Protection Agency ( US-EPA), the \nNational Toxicology Program (NTP), the  Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  \n(ATSDR),  The California Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Office of Environmental  Health \nHazard Assessment  (OEHHA), California Air Resources Board (CARB), The European Food Safety \nAuthority (EFSA), and the National Institute of Health (NIH) .  \n2.2.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature  \nTo identify studies of humans with potential occupational exposure to HCl, w e searched PubMed , \nusing  combinations of the following search terms: \u201coccupational\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \n\u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \n\u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -control\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d , clinical studies \nwere filtered out of the search to remove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s. We additionally \nsearched for epidemiology studies published since 2021 that had cited any of the literature \nreferenced in the IARC and OECD assessments that were the initial basis of Ramboll\u2019s 2021 \nreport.  \n2.2.3  Targeted PubMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nTo identify relevant toxicological data, including animal studies and studies of mutagenicity, we \nsearched PubMed  using combinations of the following search t erms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \n\u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201cchronic bioassay\u201d; and \u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d . To enhance our searches of \nthe toxicological literature, we included the terms \"cancer\", \"carcinogenicity\", and \"malignant\" \ncombined with the chemical names , and we also constructed searches combining  the chemical \nnames with the terms \"genotoxicity\" , \"mutagenicity\" , \"hyperplasia\" , and \"cell proliferation\" . \n2.2.4  Exclusion criteria  \nWe excluded p ublications  at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed in \nthe study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the test material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxi city study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3.RESULTS\n3.1 Evidence related to the p otential carcinogenicity of HCl  \n3.1.1  Restatement of previous conclusions  \nIn our 2021 report to NLA, Ramboll concluded there was no evid ence for HCl to be a carcinogen  \nbased on a review of the assessments conducted by IARC, OECD , and ICPS and incorporating \ninformation we identified in publications post -dating those assessments . Our 2021 evaluation of \nthe evidence  included  investigations of potential cancer associations  based on occupational \nepidemiology studies, and supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity studies and studies \nthat assessed the potential for HCl to induce cell proliferation.   \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n6 The occupational epidemiology studies (summarized in Table A1, Appendix A ) were \nmethodologically limited by their exposure assessment and categorization methods  that likely \nresulted in exposures that combined HCl with other industrial chemicals . The use of mixed \nexposure groups is particularly  germane, as the mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other \nstrong inorganic acid mists, which are classified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl \nand these other acids, any apparent association between HCl and cancer would be inflated due t o \nthe carcinogenic effect of exposure to the other acids. In spite of this confounding by mixed \nexposures, the results did not suggest an association  with cancer.  \nThe occupational epidemiology studies were also generally limited by inadequate control for \npotentially confounding , non-occupational  exposures, and small numbers of cases  that led to low \nstatistical power . Based on our assessment of the available evidence, Ramboll agreed with the \noverall conclusion by IARC that the small number of cancer cases ob served in various \noccupational cohorts likely represent sporadic cases and/or cases due to co-exposure by probable \nor known carcinogens , such as sulfuric and other  acid mists. \nThe genotoxicity studies  included in Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report  either indicat ed no genotoxic effect of \nHCl, or their results were deemed due to the acidic conditions of the experiments; the \nconcentrations of HCl that produced positive findings in these studies were higher than would be \nfound in the environment and are not relevant for the ambient air exposures that are the subject \nof the proposed HBEL.  Furthermore, w e did not find evidence that cell proliferation \u2013 which is \nsometimes involved  in the cancer process \u2013 is associated with  HCl exposure in in vitro  \ngenotoxicity  tests.  \n3.1.2  New literature : evidence related to the carcinogenicity of HCl  \nWe did not find any relevant toxicology studies nor additional analyses published by authoritative \nbodies that were missing from Ramboll\u2019s 2021 rep ort or that had been published since 2021.  \nWe identified three occupational epidemiology studies  published in 2021 or later.  Chen et al. \n(2021)  conducted a case -control study in south ern China based on self-reported data collected \nthrough in-person or telephone inte rviews.  The study comprised 2,514  cases and 2,586 c ontrols \nmatched on age, sex, and location.  Participants reported on work and health history and history \nof exposure to pot entially confounding factors . All exposures  to acid s and alkalis were grouped \ntogether , thereby introducing confounding of any potential HCl association by exposure to known \ncarcinogens.  The main analysis, which adjusted for potential confounders including  occupational \nexposure to other carcinogens,  provided an elevated risk estimate for nasopharyngeal cancers \n(odds ratio  (OR): 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30, 1.89) . A sub -analysis that focused on \nparticipants  categorized as ever or never exposed to sulfuric, hydrochloric and/or nitric acids \nadjusted for history of Epstein Barr virus infection  provided  an estimated OR for nasopharyngeal \ncancers of 1. 63 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.09) . Both estimates  are very likely driven by the co-expos ures \nto other acids that are classified as probable or known carcinogens . \nIn a study of 10,229  telecommunications workers (9,551 men) exposed to mixed acid mists, Ker \net al. (2021)  identified 52 deaths due to cancers of various types  (31 cancers of the digestive \nsystem, 7 lung cancers, 5 nasopharyngeal cancers, and 9 miscellaneous cancers: 3 leukemias, 1 \ncervical cancer, 1 urinary cancer, 1 thyroid cancer, 1 non -pancreatic endocrine cancer, 1 \nimmunological cancer, and 1 not specified) . Note that cancer is not one disease - different types \nof cancers have different causes (American Cancer Society 2022) . Standardized mortality ratios \n(SMR) estimated the risk  of each type of cancer observed in the study population compared with \nthe genera l population of Taiwan, where the study was conducted. All of the telecommunications \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n7 workers included in this study were exposed to mixed acids  that had been previously designated \nas probable or known  human carcinogens (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, ni tric acid ). After \ncontrolling for age, sex, and calendar year , there was no evidence of an increased risk of \nnasopharyngeal cancer  or lung cancer in the occupational cohort compared with the general \npopulation (i.e., SMR s adjusted for a five -year latency i nterval were 1.05 (p>0.99) and 0.76 \n(p=0.59), respectively ). There were some types of cancers with SMRs greater than one, but each \nhad only one to three  cases and none of these associations were statistically significant; these \nare likely to represent chance findings.  \n Moayedi -Nia et al.(2022)  published a case -control study of lung cancer nested in the Canad ian \nCARTaGENE cohort . The authors identified 147 lung cancer cases diagnosed between 20 09 and \n2016 and compared their exposure histories to the exposures reported by 1,032 non-cancer \ncontrols  based on the longest job held . Data were collected through telephone interviews and \nevaluated using CANJEM, the Canadian Job Exposure Matrix , to identify those who had no chance \nof exposure  (never exposed) , up to 25% certain ty of exposure  (ever) , and at least 25% certain ty \nof exposure (ever) to HCl based on job categor ies. After adjusting for age , smoking status, \nenvironmental tobacco smoke exp osure, family history, and ever/never exposure to all other \noccupational lung carcinogens  identified through CANJEM , participants ever occupationally \nexposed to HCl with at least 25% certainty had a n OR of 3.79 (95% CI 1.07 \u2013 13.41) for lung \ncancer compared to unexposed subjects , based on only five exposed  cases  (2 women and 3 \nmen) . The association was no longer statistically significant a fter adjustment for multiple \ncomparisons  to account for the many different potential health outcomes included in this \nanalysis , suggesting it may have been  a chance finding. There were too few cases to complete \nsex-stratified analyses . \n3.1.3  Incorporating new information into previous conclusions  for an overall \nassessment of evidence related to carcinogenicity of HCl  \nCombining the results of literature that we reviewed  for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and this one, we \nfound a total of 22 occupational epidemiology studies . The information included in the three \noccupational epidemiology studies that we identified with publication dates in 2021 or later does \nnot alter the conclusions  we reached in 2021 . Taken together, the results  of the available \nliterature did not suggest that occupational exposure to HCl increase d the risk of cancer .  \nTwo of the occupational epidemiology studies provided quantitative exposure data. Bond et al. \n(1991)  estimated cumulative and maximum average HCl exposures for subjects in a nested case -\ncontrol study concerning lung cancer mo rtality. Compared to subjects with no estimated  \nexposure, subjects with 2 ppm -years to 3.9 ppm -years  (0.15  to 5.81 mg/m3-year) 2F3, 4.0 to 12.4 \nppm-years  (5.96 , 18.48 mg/m3-year) , and 12.5 ppm -years (18.63 mg/m3-year) or greater \nshowed non -statistically significant risk ratios  of 0.9 (95% confidence interval 0.6 ,1.3), 1.2 \n(95% CI: 0.8,1.9), and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6, 1.8), respectively. The re was no evidence of a trend  \nacross these groups (chi2 = 0.14, p = 0.35).  When categorized according to  maximum average \nexposures, compared to unexposed subjects, subjects with a maximum of less than 2 ppm (2.98 \nmg/m3*) showed a risk ratio of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2) and subjects with a maximum of greater \nthan or equal to 2 ppm (2.98 mg/m3*) showed a  risk ratio of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8,1.6). Neither \ncumulative exposures nor maximum average exposures yielded statistically significant results for \nany exposure level.  \n3 Here and elsewhere, conversions from p pm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere . \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n8 Coggon et al. (1996)  reported non -statisticall y significant results when analyzing aerodigestive \ncancer mortality and maximum acid mist exposure levels. Compared to unexposed subjects, \nsubjects ever exposed to less than 1 mg/ m3 showed an odds ratio of 1.9 (95% CI: 0.2, 15.8), \nand subjects exposed to 1  mg/m3 or greater showed an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% CI: 0.3, 5.7). \nNotably , the maximum exposures include sulfuric acid or HCl mists  rather than HCl exclusively , \nwhich is an important distinction because IARC concluded that HCl exposures other than mists \nwere not carcinogenic . Despite this  mixed exposure  (mixed acid mists) , the odds ratios reported \nby Coggon et al.  (1996)  were not statistically significant .   \nThe effects of HCl exposure ha ve also been investigated in animal studies ( see Appendix, Table \nA2). The carcinogenicity of HCl was examined in groups of 100 Sprague -Dawley  rats exposed by \ninhalation  to either  gaseous HCl, formaldehyde , two types of combinations of HCl and \nformaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week over 122 \nweeks  (Albert et al. 1982; Sellakumar 1985) . Results were also compared to those for unexposed \ncontrol animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) 3F4 in the HCl -only exposure. \nFollowing sacrifice, animals were examined fo r tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special \nattention to the respiratory tract. Results  of the study indicated increased  incidence of  \nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of animals exposed to HCl \nalone as compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed.   \nOther cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development 2002)  \u2013 a dermal exposure study (Narat, 1925 as cited by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  and an oral exposure study \n(Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . No \nmalignant tumors were reported  in 99 mice dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions \ncontaining 3 -5% HCl every 1-2 days , and then weekly for 4 -6 additional weeks (total exposure \nduration 25 -46 weeks) (Narat,1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment 2002) .  \nDyer et al.  (1946, as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002)  \norally exposed groups of mice to a combination of HCl (1 -2.5 moles per liter) and either a \n\u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene ( 40 mice) and reported n o \nexcess cancer or pre -cancerous lesions observed in the stomachs of animals from either group \nexposed to HCl. OECD concluded neither  study was appropriate for the assessment of \ncarcinogenicity because of the shortcomings of the stud y design .  \nAn important consideration when determining carcinogenicity is the ability of a chemical to induce \ngenotoxicity or mutagenicity. Genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals typically are not considered to  \nhave a threshold for their  effects to occur. HCl did not induce mutations in six bacterial mutation \nassays nor in one mutation assay in yeast cells (reviewed by IARC 1992; Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell \nsurvival in strains that have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two \nassays , but OECD concluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) . A weakly positive respo nse for \nmutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay; these results are interpreted as being \nan artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell culture medium), which itself related to cell \ndeath. Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cul tures were negative (IARC 1992; \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development  2002) . HCl induced chromosome \n4 Here and elsewhere, conversions from ppm to mg/m3 assumed  a molecular weight of 36.5 and 25\u00b0C, 1 atmosphere.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n9 aberrations in mammalian cells in culture at concentrations in excess of 10 mM in the cell culture \nmedia (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8) and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse  lymphoma cells, and in insect and plant cells . IARC (1992)  and OECD \n(2002)  found that the acidic pH is the responsible factor for these responses and that similar \nresponses are observed for other ino rganic acids and with acetic acid. These concentrations \nwould not be found environmentally and are thus not relevant for ambient air exposures to HCl.  \nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been \nstudied, and very small numbers of cases of various types of cancers, which are expected to have \ndifferent causes and risk factors, have been identified. This is in spite of the high likelihood that \nindividuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures that included \nrecognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Such mixed exposure groups would \nincorrectly assign risk to HCl if the risk were actually due to expos ure to the other chemicals that \nco-occurred with HCl. The small numbers of cases have resulted in very unstable risks estimated \nwith a high degree of uncertainty; in addition to the confounding effects of other exposures, \nchance cannot be ruled out as the cause of those findings.   \nHCl is a commonly used industrial chemical with a long history of use (IARC  1992) . Had there \nbeen a causal association between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have \nbeen raised and any potential association would have been more fully investigated. The small \nnumber of cases that have been detected in th e existing research base implies HCl is likely not a \ncarcinogen; the cases were most probably caused by co -exposures to known occupational \ncarcinogens and/or to uncontrolled confounding by non -occupational carcinogenic exposures, \nsuch as cigarette smoking.   \n3.2 Has the scientific community judged there to be a threshold for health effects \nassociated with HCl exposure? \nIt is logically impossible to prove a negative, i.e., that HCl does not cause cancer. \nHCl currently has many industrial uses, in the productio n of chlorides, fertilizers, and dyes, in the \nsteel, textile and rubber industries , in the production of numerous chemicals, making it one of \nthe most widely used chemicals in industrial processes  (IARC 1992) . Given its wide use in \nindustry, it can be inferred logically that occupational exposure to this chemical is common. Very \nlittle research on its c arcinogenicity has been carried out, however, suggesting that no or few \nsignals have emerged to indicate an elevated cancer risk associated with occupational exposure \nto HCl. This inference is borne out by the small numbers of cancer cases identified among  the \nthousands of occupationally exposed individuals included in the studies we identified (Table A1 in \nAppendix A)  and is supported by toxicological evidence indicating a lack of mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic activity by HCl.  \nSome substances may produce tumors through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing \nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations. \nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration below which no \neffects are see n. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed \nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was \nno evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985) . Furthermore, in studies where HCl was \nadministered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3)\nHCl neither cause d serious irritating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n10 In conclusion, t he available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is \nmutagenic or carcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation \nthat are typically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal \nstudies indicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3) led to increased incidence of \nhyperplasi a, hyperplasia would not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations \nbelow the threshold  at which hyperplasia was reported .  \n3.3 Proposed margin of safety  \nThe US-EPA has derived a RfC for HC l of 0.2 mg/m3 (Table 1) based on the lowest adverse effect \nlevel (LOAEL) of 10 ppm (14.9 mg/m3*) reported by Sellakumar et al. (1985) . The LOAEL is \nbased on the incidence of hyperplasia reported in rats chronic ally exposed to HC l via inhalation , \nand the assumption that a threshold concentration exists below which no  effects would be seen \nfollowing HC l exposure . US-EPA has designated \u201clow confidence\u201d in the current RfC based on the \nstudy used as the basis for the  RfC and the sparsity of the overall database for HC l (animal and \nhuman toxicity data). The study that serves as the basis for the RfC (Sellakumar 1985)  includes \nonly one treatment group and a control group. In a ddition, the supporting toxicity data includes \nonly subchronic toxicity studies with no additional chronic or reproductive toxicity data. Based on \nthe research completed for Ramboll\u2019s 2021 report and the review of both toxicology and \nepidemiology data completed from 2021 to the present, there are no additional data that could \nbe considered by US-EPA that could increase the confidence in the RfC at this time. More studies \nwould have to be conducted in order to increase confidence in the RfC, and they should include \nchronic exposures and reproductive endpoints . \nThe chronic REL (CREL) developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) , \nof 0.009 mg/m3 (Table 1) is also based  on the same ch ronic toxicity study (Sellakumar 1985)  \nthat serves as the basis for the RfC derived by US-EPA. While both the US-EPA and CalEPA \ntoxicity values are based on the same underlying  animal toxicity data and derived using similar \nmethodologies  there are significant differences in the two toxicity values with the CalEPA CREL \nbeing lower than US-EPA\u2019s RfC (RfC of 0.2 mg/m3 vs. CREL of 0.009 mg/m3). The difference  in \nthe values is related to the use of US-EPA\u2019s s guidance on  the dosimetry adjustment of inhalation \nof gases  (US-EPA 1994) . The dosimetric adjustment equation considers the surface area all \nregions of the respiratory t ract that are affected  (i.e., extrathoracic, tracheobronchial  and \npulmonary) .  When conducting the dosimetry adjustment, CalEPA only considered the \nextrathoracic surface area . However, consistent with the results reported by Sellakumar et al. \n(1985)  of increased hyperplasia in both the larynx and the trachea , US-EPA included the surface \narea of both the extrathoracic  and tracheobronchial  respiratory region. CalEPA  notes that while \nextrathoracic and tracheobronchi al effects were reported in rats following exposures to hydrogen \nchloride , the REL was based on extrathoracic effects because humans are predicted to be \nrelatively more susceptible to the effects of hydrogen chloride in that region.  However, no basis \nfor this prediction was presented by CalEPA. The US-EPA guidelines recommend that when  \neffects are observed in the mid -respiratory  tract (tracheobronchial ), this region should also  be \nconsidered in the dosimetry  adjustment calculations.  Therefore, US-EPA\u2019s approach for the \nderivation of the RfC aligns with the guidelines for dosimetric adjustments following inhalation of \ngases and  better represents  the observed respiratory effects reported  in the scientific literature.  \nUS-EPA conducted a risk assessment to determine an HBEL for HCl for the Lime Manufacturing \nsource category.  The purpose  of the assessment  was to determine the level of HCl emissions that \nwould ensure health thresholds are not exceeded with an ample margin of safety . Unit emission s \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n11 of one ton per year of HC l along with emission release parameters for each facility  were used to \nestimate the HBEL . Inhalation exposure concentrations and potential health risks were estimated \nusing US-EPA\u2019s Human Exposure Model (HEM4) , which incorporates the American Meteorological \nSociety/ US-EPA Regulatory Model (AERMOD) dispersion modeling system (AERMOD version \n22112) , a Gaussian plume dispersion model for modeling point, area, and volume sources of \ncontinuous air emissions  (USEPA 2005) .  \nUS-EPA provides details of the risk assessment and HBEL estimation in a  memo, \u201cRisk Approach \nto Assess a Health -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for the Lime Manufacturing \nSource Category\u201d ( US-EPA Docket: EPA -HQ-OAR-2017-0015). The reported inputs for the air \nmodeling were conservative . Unit emissions of 1 ton per year ( tpy) of HCl assigned to each \nfacility  were used as input into HEM4 to estimate the maximum ambient chronic concentration , \nwhich were th en scaled up by a factor of 300 to assess chronic and acute risks. A default hourly \nacute emissions multiplier of 10 was appl ied to reflect 1 -hour emissions ten times the annual \nemissions level divided by 8 ,760 hours per year.  Annual concentrations were estimated to assess \nchronic health impacts and 1 -hour concentrations were estimated to assess acute health impacts. \nIn assess ing the margin of safety for environmental HCl exposure, US-EPA calculated  the chronic \nnoncancer health hazard based on a hazard quotient (HQ) , which is the estimated exposure at a \nlocation divided by a reference level (e.g., the RfC). HQs of \u22641 are not li kely to cause adverse \nhealth effects , and as exposures increase above the reference level resulting in HQs >1, the \npotential for adverse effects increases. For assessing acute risks US-EPA performed a screening \nassessment using conservative assumptions combined with reasonable worst -case exposure.  \nThis screening process results in the facility being determined to pose no potential acute health \nrisks (i.e., it \u201cscreens out\u201d), or the facility  requires further assessment. The toxicity reference \nvalues used  for the risk assessment of chronic exposure were based on recommendations for \nHAPS  (USEPA 2018) . The toxicity reference values recommended by HAPs in order of priority are \nUS-EPA RfC\u2019s and CalEPA\u2019s REL  (Table 1). US-EPA\u2019s dose-response assessment for acute \nexposure to HCl was also based on the existing recommendations of HAPs. The res ults from \nscreening acute assessments were compared to C alEPA\u2019s Acute Reference Exposure Levels \n(ARELs), Acute Exposure Guideline Levels (AEGLs) and Emergency Response Planning Guidelines \n(ERPGs)  (Table 1). \nBased on conservative air modeling assumption s and toxicity reference values based on the best \navailable science and methodologies, US-EPA derived a HBEL emission level of 300 tpy of HCl. \nResults of the risk assessment indicated t he maximum chronic non -cancer hazard from HCl \nemissions for this source category resulted in an HQ equal to 0.2, which is 5 times below a HQ of \n1 indicating  adverse chronic health effects are not likely to occur.  For the acute assessment, \nthree facilities had acute screening HQ values equaling or approaching a value of 1. EPA reported \nthat an examination of aerial imagery of the facilities showed  maximum acute off -site HQ equal \nto 0.6.   \nOverall, the air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n \nacceptable margin of safety . The default assu mptions of the air model are expected to produce \nconservative air concentrations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce \nreasonable exposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity \nreference values  used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n12 4.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nHumans are exposed to approximately 4 million tons per year of HCl from natural sources\n(volcanoes, marine life, combustion of vegetation), as well as industrial  sources, HCl is one of the\nmost important basic industrial chemicals IARC (1992) summa rized estimated mean air\nconcentrations of HCl in occupational settings ranging from <0.1 mg/m3 to 12 mg/m3 during acid\ntreatment of metals. Mean exposures during other industrial processes are estimated as >1\nmg/m3. HCl is also found in household products  such as cleaners and swimming pool additives\nand is formed during the burning of many plastics.  IARC (1992)  reported that ambient air levels\nof HCl typically remain below 0.01 mg/m3.\nAs shown in Table A1 in the Appendix,  tens of thousands of employees exposed to HCl have been\nstudied  with no clear signals of elevated cancer risks emerging.  This is in spite of the high\nlikelihood that individuals classified as being exposed to HCl were actually exposed to mixtures\nthat inc luded recognized occupational carcinogens, including acid mists. Had there been a causal\nassociation between HCl exposure and cancer, it is likely that concerns would have been raised\nand any potential association would have been more fully investigated.\nIARC (1992)  recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industri al\nprocesses. In assessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong\ninorganic acids,\u201d IARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational\nexposure to \u201cstrong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric ac id\u201d with cancer. They therefore\nconcluded that occupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is\ncarcinogenic to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992) . In contrast, IARC\u2019s\nconclusion regarding HCl was that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of\nHCl, and they therefore assessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to\nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based\non exposure to mixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are\nfound together  in mixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the\nstrongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, su lfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the\nwhole mixture. This is likely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associ ations observed in\noccupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  All occupational epidemiology studies\npublished since the 1992 IARC determination are consistent with this conclusion.\nAs shown in Table A2 in the Appendix, t he effects of HCl exposure have also been investigated in\nanimal studies. Results  of the only chronic exposure study  indicated increased  incidence of\nhyperplasia (indicative of cell proliferation) in the larynx and trachea of rats exposed to HCl alone\nas compared to air controls or colony controls, but no excess cancer was observed  (Sellakumar\n1985) . Two short term cancer studies in experimental animals were reported by OECD\n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 2002) : Neither  the dermal exposure\nstudy (Narat, 1925 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation and De velopment 2002)\nnor the oral exposure study (Dyer et al. 1946 as cited by Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development 2002)  reported any increase in cancer  occurrence .\nSome substances may produce tumors  through a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing\nextensive cell turnover which leads to the possibility of replication errors leading to mutations.\nHowever, such mechanisms are believed to have a threshold concentration  below which no\neffects are seen. In the case of HCl, results from carcinogenicity studies in animals showed\nincreased cell proliferation in the form of hyperplasia in the respiratory tract; however, there was\nRamboll  - Support for public comments relevant to the US -EPA pre -proposed HBEL for HCl  \n13 no evidence of carcinogenicity (Sellakumar 1985)  and there was no evidence of genotoxicity or \ncell proliferation resulting from HCl exposures (reviewed by OECD). Furthermore, in studies \nwhere HCl was administered along with formaldehyde (Albert et al. 1982) , exposures to 10 ppm \nHCl neither cause d serious irrit ating effects nor enhance d the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde.  \nThe available toxicological and epidemiological evidence does not indicate HCl is mutagenic or \ncarcinogenic  and there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic carcinogens. While the evidence from animal studies \nindicated chronic HCl exposure to 10 ppm led to increased incidence of hyperplasia, hyperplasia \nwould not be expected to progress to cancer at exposure concentrations  below the threshold at \nwhich hyperplasia was reported.  \nThe air modeling performed by US-EPA for this assessment should contribute to a n acceptable \nmargin of safety . The default assumptions of the air model are expected to produce conservative \nair concent rations , and t he definition of the receptor locations should produce reasonable \nexposure estimates for existing receptors . In addition, the chronic and acute toxicity reference \nvalues used for the risk assessment are based on the best available science.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore \nrecommends, as specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4), that the MACT standard for HCl be based on \na health -based threshold, including an ample margin of safety.  \n5.REFE RENCES\nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelson N, Snyder CA. 1982.

HCl has been known  since the \nMiddle Ages, and was first commercially produced in the early 1800\u2019 s. Because of its many \nindustria l uses,  occupational exposure to HCl is common .  \nHCl has been the subject of toxicity studies in experimental animals and epidemiologic al studies  \nin exposed workers. Several authoritative groups (including the World Health Organization\u2019s \nInternational Agen cy for Research on Cancer [IARC], the International P rogramme on Chemical \nSafety [IPCS], and the  international Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development \n[OECD ]), have conducted evaluations of the carcinogenic potential of HCl. None of the se groups \nhave concluded that HCl is a carcinogen.  Other authoritative bodies (including the US \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and the US National Toxicology Program) have chosen not to \nevaluate the carcinogenicity of HCl, estimating that carcinogenicity is un likely ba sed on its \nphysical, chemical, and corrosive properties and the lack of evidence suggesting an association \nwith cancer .  \nRamboll US Consulting, Inc. (Ramboll) was asked by the National Lime Association to investigate \nthe potential carcinogenicity of HCl in  order to determine whether it is appropriate for US EPA to \nregulate HCl as a non -carcinogen by using an established health based threshold consistent with \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) . In addition to relying upon previous authoritative reviews, Ramb oll did \na series of additional literature search es for any new studies which migh t indicate HCl is a \ncarcinogen. We employed several search strategies to make sure we uncovered any new \nscientific evidence that may not have been considered by previous asses sments. Despite  this \nbroad search, we identified  only six additional publications . This newer evidence is consistent \nwith the earlier body of scientific evidence . In addition to direct studies of cancer associations, we \nalso examined other supporting evide nce in th e form of genotoxicity studies or potential to \ninduce cell proliferation. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological data into account, the \nevidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often fou nd together in industrial processes . In \nassessing the scientific evidence for the grouping \u201c sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids ,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid \u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogenic to \nhumans ( i.e., a \u201c Group 1 \u201d carcinogen ) (IARC 1992). In contrast , IARC\u2019s conclusio n regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans ( i.e., a \u201c Group \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regardin g acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outc ome (in this case,  surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a car cinogen, either by  authoritative reviews or Ramboll\u2019s own \nsearch of the scientific literature , despite its long history of use. Ramboll therefore recommends  \nthat based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d),  it would be \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n entire ly appropriate for  EPA to base its  standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, including an \nample margin of safety.  \n \n \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 1 1. INTRODUCTION  \n1.1 Hydro chloric Acid  (HCl)  \nHydrochloric aci d is a strong corrosive acid that is formed when hydrogen chloride gas is \ndissolved in water  (also k nown as an aqueous solution) . Hydrogen chloride gas and aqueous  \nhydrochloric acid have the same chemical formula: HCl. Chemists will designate the gas form as \nHCl(g) and the aqueous form as HCl(aq). For the purpose of this report, we refer to either of the \nphysical states  as HCl.  \nHCl is used in the production of chlor ides, fertilizers, and dyes, as well as in the textile and \nrubber industries.1 Commercial concentrated hydroc hloric acid  contains 36% to 38% hydrogen \nchloride in water. HCl can also be formed a s a byproduct of combustion of certain fossil fuels in \nindustrial manufacturing processes, for example from lime kilns used for manufacture of lime \n(CaO and MgO).   \nAt room temperature, HCl is a nonflammable, colorless to slightly yellow gas with a pungent odor \nin moist air.2,3 On exposure to air, the gas forms dense white vapors due to condensation with \natmospheric moisture. When hydrogen chloride gas come s into contact with moisture, it forms \nhydrochloric acid. In the early twentieth century, hydrogen chlo ride was created by b urning \nhydrogen gas. This method created a product of higher purity tha n that of the reaction between \nchloride salts and sulfuric acid or sodium hydrogen sulfate (IARC, 1992).   \n1.2 Residual Risk and Technology Review   \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (US  EPA) regulates \nhazardous air pollutants (HAPs, also known as air toxics) originating from industrial facilities . \nThere is a two -stage process  for this regulation : \n\u2022 In the first  stage, section 112(d)  requires the US EPA to develop technology -based \nstandards , called maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards,  for each \ncatego ry of sources (e.g., petroleum refineries, pulp  and paper mills, etc.) .4  \n\u2022 In the second stage, US EPA is required und er section  112(f)(2) to assess the health and \nenvironmental risks that remain after implementation of the  MACT standards . If \nadditional risk reductions are necessary to protect public health with an  ample margin of \nsafety or to prevent an adverse environme ntal effect, US EPA must develop  standards to \naddress these remaining risks . This second stage of the regulatory process is  known as \nthe residual risk stage . For each source category for which US EPA issued MACT  \nstandards, the residual risk stage must be c ompleted within eight years of promulgation \nof the  initial technology -based standard .  \nAlso, under section 112(d)(6), US EPA must review each of the technology -based standards at \nleast every eight years and revise it, as necessary, taking into account deve lopments in \npractices, processes and control technologies. If appropriate based on the results of the risk and \ntechnology reviews, the US EPA will revise the rule. For efficiency, the US EPA  includes the 112(f) \n \n1 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016 -09/documents/hydrochloric -acid.pdf  \n2 https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MHMI/mmg173.pdf  \n3 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Hydrochlo ric-acid#section=Solubility  \n4 https://www.epa.gov/stationary -sources -air-pollution/risk -and-technology -review -national -emissions -standards -hazardous  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 2 and 112(d) analyses in the same regulatory pa ckage and calls the rulemakings the Risk and \nTechnology Review.  \nMACT standards require the \u201cmaximum degree of [emissions] reductions\u201d that US EPA \ndetermines \u201cis achievable.\u201d The MACT standard is based on a minimum stringency requirement \n(a \u201cfloor\u201d) based on  emissions levels achieved by existing sources, where the floor is based on \naverage emission limitation achieved by the best -performing 12% of existing sources (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d Alternatively, as outlined in 42 U.S.C . \u00a7 \n7412(d)(4), the MACT standard may be based on a health -based threshold, assuming such a \nthreshold has been established. This health -based threshold must include an ample margin of \nsafety. The US EPA will not approve a health -based threshold for  a MACT standard if a HAP is a \ncarcinogen.  As part of the statutory lime manufacturing risk and technology review, EPA \nconducted an inhalation risk assessment for HAPs emitted from lime kilns, including HCl, and \nfound no unacceptable human health risk unde r worst case emissions scenarios ( 84 FR 48,723 \n(Sep. 16, 2019) ).The EPA risk assessment assumed HCl is a non -carcinogen, and as such used a \nvariety of human -health risk sc reening benchmarks as part of risk calculations. Ramboll therefore \nhas undertaken this review to confirm the status of HCl as a non -carcinogen, and validate EPA\u2019s \nrisk assessment approach . \nBased on communication with the National Lime Association ( via emai l), the gas temperature at \nthe inlet to the air pollution control device (APCDs) is typically above 400 degrees F for most \nstraight rotary and preheater lime kilns, and roughly 275 degrees for vertical kilns. These \nelevated temperatures are well above the acid dew  point for HCl (typically about 130 degrees F).   \nStack test data obtained from wet chemistry and vapor phase testing have also confirmed the \npresence of HCl as a gas in the exhaust. The vast majority of U.S. lime kilns (>95 percent) are \ncontrolled with dry  APCDs. For kilns controlled with a wet scrubber, HCl emissions as mist are \nexpected to be very low due to the solubility of HCl in water, i.e., the gas is readily absorbed in \nwater.   \n1.3 Objective of this report  \nThe objective of this report is to review and s ynthesize  the scientific literature regarding the \ncarcinogenicity of HCl.  Ramboll base d this assessment on a combination of previous assessments \nby authoritative bodies, as well as our own literature search.  \n1.4 Previous assessments of HCl carcinogenicity  \nHCl has been evaluated for carcinogenicity by several authoritative agencies or groups, including \nthe World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC), the \nOrganisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ), and the International \nProgramme on Chemical Safety (IPCS). Neither the National Toxicology Program \u2019s (NTP) Report \non Carcinogen ( NTP, 2016 ) nor the US EPA\u2019s Integrative Risk Information System (IRIS) program  \nhave assessed the carcinogenicity of HCl, and neither Agency is currently evaluating the chemical \n(US EPA 2021a5; NTP, 20196). For a common chemical such as HCl, this usually means that the \nrelevant agency does not consider the evidence compelling enough to undertake a major review \n \n5 https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021 -03/doc uments/iris_program_outlook_mar2021.pdf  \n6 https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/cancer/ongoing/index.html  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 3 effort  (US EPA , 2021b7; NTP, 2016a8; NTP 2016b ).  \nThe stated purpose of IARC reviews, published in monographs, is to identify cancer hazards , i.e., \nagents that are capable of causing cancer. IARC is explicit that hazard s are separate from actual \nrisks, with the latter depend ing on factors including exposure duration  and concentration. \nSubstances are raised for review by IARC every five years by an Advisory Group  that makes its \nrecommendations from nominations submitted by scienti sts and regulatory agencies . The \nselection is based on the ava ilability of data and current public health priorities, as well as the \nexistence of signals that the substance may pose a cancer hazard9. IARC convened a working \ngroup of experts  to evaluate HCl i n October 1991 and published their findings in a monograph \n(IARC 1992) . Based on their evaluation of the occupational cohort and case -control studies and \ntoxicological data  available in 199 1 (see section 2.1 for discussion of these studies) , IARC  \nconcluded  that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in humans and that \nthere was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl in animals. Based on these findings, \nIARC concluded that HCl is not classifiable  as to it s carcinogenicity in  humans (Group 3).  This \ncategory is used for agents, mixture s, and exposure circumstances which IARC has evaluated \nand found that \u201c the evidence of carcinogenicity is inadequate in humans and inadequate or \nlimited in experimental animals. \u201d If IARC finds evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity , \u201c\u2026the \nWorking Grou p may add a sentence to the evaluation to characterize the agent as well -studied \nand without evidence of carcinogenicity.\u201d The other classifications used by IARC are  carcinogenic \nto humans  (Group 1); probably carcinogenic to humans  (Group 2A) and possibly carcinogenic to \nhumans (Group 2B)9. In its history, IARC classified only one chemical as probably not \ncarcinogenic  to humans (Group 4) , and the Agency eliminated this category in 2019 ; more tha n \nhalf of the 1,090 chemicals it has reviewed have been classif ied as Group 3 .10 11 \nIARC also reviewed other inorganic acids in the same monograph , including \u201csulfuric acid  and \nother strong inorganic acids\u201d  (IARC  1992) . In contrast to their conclusion for HCl, t heir conclusion \nfor sulfuric acid and other strong inorgani c acids  was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence  that \noccupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d \nIARC\u2019s overall evaluation was that \u201cOccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists \ncontaining sulfuric  acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) \u201d (IARC 1992).  This is relevant \nbecause the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that must include sulfur ic acid. While \nsulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid exposures , the exposure c ontained in \nthe mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive \nthe relationship for the whole mixture. Thi s is likely the explanation for the sporadic effects \nobserved in occupational studies of mixed acids containing HCl.  \nThe Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD ) Screening Information \nDataset  (SIDS) Initial Assessment Profile (2002) evaluated the scientific literature concerning \nevidence for the carcinogenicity of HCl an d concluded th at \u201cIn humans, no association between \nhydrogen chloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d Their assessment is based on \nstudies finding no association between HCl exposure and cancer  (Albert et al., 1982; Farrow et \nal., 1989; Bond et al. , 1986; Bo nd et al. , 1991; Bond et al. , 1993; Bond et al. , 1995) .

They further stated that, on the basis of the limited information available from \nindustrial survey data, and from the observations of controlled exposure studies, it is mo st \nunlikely that the general population is exposed routinely to any significant health risks from HCl.  \n2. SEARCH METHODS   \n2.1 Identifying Relevant Literature  \nIn their Monograph Volume 54, published in 1992, IARC identified a total of 8 relevant \nepidemiological studies , including 3 cohort studies ( Collins et al. 1989 ; Beaumont et al. 1967 ; \nSteenland et al 1988) and 5 case-control studies (Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond et \nal., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; and Siemiatyc ki, 1991). IARC also identified a single experimental \nanimal cancer study (Sellakumar et al., 1 985), which examined rats exposed by inhalation to \nHCl.  \nIn their SIDS document, OECD (2002) identified many of the same studies identified by IARC \n(1992), as well as one additional epidemiological study ( Farrow et al, 1989) and one \nexperimental animal study (Albert et al., 1982). They also discussed two exp erimental animal \nstudies ( a dermal exposure study, Narat, 1925; and an oral administration study, Dyer et al., \n1946) which they judged, due to study design limitations, were not appropriate for assessing \ncarcinogenic potential.  \nAfter starting with the lite rature identified by the authoritative reviews ( ICPS, 1082; IARC, 1992; \nOECD , 2002 ), we developed a literature search strategy consisting of three different approaches : \n(1) Reviewing papers published since IARC considered the carcinogenicity of HCl in 1991  that \ncited the relevant epidemiolog ical studies cited in the IARC monograph vol. 54;  (2) a search  of \nepidemiological studies addressing possible associations between exposure to HCl and cancer ; \nand (3) a targeted search of chronic (long-term) bioassays fo r cancer associated with HCl \nexposure  in experimental animals . Because HCl is a common laboratory ingredient used in many \nexperimental set -ups, a broad er literature search for animal studies or in vitro  studies would \nhave resulted in an overwhelming number  of irrelevant papers. We therefore conducted a very \ntargeted search  for additional animal studies . \nBoth t he search of epidemiological studies examining cancer as a health endpoint and the \ntargeted search of chronic bioassay studies for cancer in animals u sed PubMed, a database \ndeveloped by the National Library of Medicine that includes  more than 32 million citations for \nbiomedical literature from journal articles in life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine , \nand online books . \n2.1.1  Papers That Cited Epidemiological Papers  Included in IARC or OECD  \nUsually, authors of journal articles cite previous relevant research in their manuscripts . Ramboll \ntherefore conducted a search of scientific papers that cited the literature identified by IARC \n(1992)  or OECD ( 2002).  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 5 Using the database Google Scholar , Ramboll conducted a search for any papers that cite one or \nmore of the 9 studies identified by IARC (Sellakumar et al., 1985; Collins et al. , 1989; Beaumont \net al., 1967; Steenland et al ., 1988; Bond et al., 1983; B ond et al., 1985; Bond et al., 1986; and \nSiemiatyc ki, 1991)  or the additional epidemiological studies identified  by OECD ( Farrow  et al., \n1989). We did not perform citation searches on the experimental animal studies discussed by \nOECD (2002) because the Albert et al . (1982) bioassay study was superseded by the subsequent \npublication by  the same group  (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ), and because the two other cancer \nstudies in experimental animals (Dyer et al., 1946; Naret, 1925) were judged by OECD (2002) as \nhavin g major faults in their study design precluding conclus ions to be drawn from their results.  \n2.1.2  PubMed Search  of Epidemiological Literature   \nA literature search was conducted using PubMed , based  on using  combinations of the following \nsearch terms: \u201coccupationa l\u201d; \u201chuman\u201d; \u201chuman exposure\u201d; \u201chydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chy drogen \nchloride\u201d; \u201ccarcinogenicity\u201d; \u201ccarcinogen\u201d; \u201ccancer\u201d; \u201cepidemiology\u201d; \u201ccohort\u201d; and \u201ccase -\ncontrol\u201d. When searches included \u201ccancer\u201d, clinical studies were filtered out of the search so as to \nremove irrelevant  studies of clinical trial s.  \n2.1.3  Targeted Pu bMed Search  of Animal Toxicity Literature  \nA targeted literature search was conducted using PubMed, based  on using combinations of the \nfollowing search terms: \u201c hydrochloric acid\u201d; \u201chydrogen chloride\u201d; \u201c chronic bioassay\u201d; and \n\u201clifetime cancer risk\u201d .  \n2.1.4  Exclusion criteria  \nPublications  were excluded at the screening stage  if HCl was not an exposure variable assessed \nin the study or if HCl exposure was not assessed in human subjects (for the search targeting \nepidemiological studies) or if HCl was not the te st material administered to animals or the study \nwas an aquatic toxicity study (for the search targeting chronic bioassays for cancer in \nexperimental animals).  \n3. RESULTS   \n3.1 Literature Search  Findings   \nThe results  from different steps  of this search process are  outlined in Figure 1 (PRISMA diagram).  \nA total of eight epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et al., 1983; Bond et al., \n1985; Bond et al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Collins et al. 1989; Siemia tycki, 1991; Steenland et \nal., 1988 ) and one cancer study in experimental animals (Sellakumar et al., 1985 ) were included \nin the IARC (2002)  report.  A total of six epidemiological studies (Beaumont et al., 1987; Bond et \nal., 1983; Bond et al., 1985; Bond e t al., 1986; Bond et al., 1991; Farrow et al. 1989) and four \ncancer studies in experimental animals (Albert et al., 1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 1925; \nSellakumar et al., 1985 ) were cited in OECD (2002)12. Note, there was some overlap between  \nthese two sets of studies. Together,  a total of 13 unique  studies were identified \u2013 nine \n \n12 Note, one further publication cited by OECD ( ANON, ed. 1987 . Pestic. Toxic. Chem. News., 15(43), 6. ) was reported only in summary  form and \nneither the publication nor the abstract could be found. It was not included in the counts. OECD reported that all respiratory cancer cases in this \nstudy were smokers; therefore, confounding cannot be ruled out.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 6 epidemiological and four in animal s (see Appendix A) .  \nConducting a search of scientific publications that cite the se IARC-cited or OECD -cited studies \nresulted in a total of 1,008  publications to screen .13 We screened the tit les and abstracts of these \npublications, and identified five additional papers ( Coggon et al. 1996; Hathaway et al. 1997; \nSoskolne et al. 2011 ; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nThe PubMed search es for epidemiological publications  resulted in a total of 1,934  scientific \npublications ; after removal of duplicates  and publications that had been identified through \nauthoritative searches or citation searches , 771 unique publications  remained. The targeted \nPubMed search of the animal toxicological literature resulted in 56 publications ; after removal of \nduplicates  and publications that had been identified through authoritative searches or citation \nsearches , 34 unique publications remained.  Overall, 805 unique p ublications were identified  \nthrough both PubMed search  strategies . We screened the titles and abstracts of these unique \npublications to identify 24 publications  which warranted a f ull text screen for relevance . Only one \nadditional relevant publication was identified from this full text screen (Tsai et al. 2016 ).  \nA total o f 19 relevant articles were identified through the combined literature search strateg y, \nconsisting of  the initial nine epidemiological stud ies identified by IARC a nd OECD and four \ntoxicol ogy study identified by IARC and OECD , and the six additional  articles (five epidemiological \nstudies  identified through the  citation search of the initial articles, and one additional article \nresulting from the very broad PubMed search es) (Figure 1 ).  \n3.2 Summary of Findings  \nThe 19 relevant publications  identified  through this extensive literature search included:  13 \nepidemiological  studies containing  statistical  analys es of the association between exposure to HCl \nand cancer ; four publicati ons examining  cancer in experimental animals;  one commentary/letter \nto the editor , and one review . Below is a discussion of three cohort studies ( Collins et al ., 1989; \nBeaumont et al ., 1987; Steenland et al ., 1988), ten case-control studies  (Bond et al ., 1983; \nBond et al ., 1985; Bond et al ., 1986; Bond et al. , 1991; Siemiatycki , 1991; Fritschi and \nSiemiatycki 1996a; Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b; Farrow et al. 1989; Coggon et al. , 1996; \nSosklone et al. , 2011), and four animal toxicity stud ies (Sellakumar e t al., 1985; Albert et al., \n1982; Dyer et al., 1946; Narat, 192 5). See Appendix A for list of all relevant publications.  A \ndetailed  summary of the epidemiological studies, including information on study characteristics, \nstatistical analyses, and limitation s, is included in Appendix B.  \n \n \n13 Among the experimental animal s tudies, only the Sellakumar et al. 1985 st udy was the subject of our search because the Albert et al., 1982 \npublication was superseded by the subsequent Sellakumar et al., 1985 publication, and the other two experimental animal cance r studies were \nvery old  and inadequate . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 7  \n3.3 Discussion of Individual Publicat ions \nWe discuss individual studies of the carcinogenicity of HCl and HCl mists below. Further details of \nthese studies can be found in Appendix B. \n \n\nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 8 3.3.1  Epidemiolog ical Studies   \nIn a cohort study  of steel workers involved in pickling operations, Beaumont et al.  (1987) \nexamined lung cancer mortality patterns in 1,165 workers exposed to sulfuric acid mist and other \nacid mists (primarily HCl mist) . Jobs were categorized by acid use (sulfuric acid or other acid)  \nand exposure potential  (i.e., the likelihood of daily exposure) in order to define the following  \nexposure categor ies: (1) any acid exposure  (the entire exposed cohort) ; (2) sulfuric acid \nexposure only ; (3) sulfuric acid only with probable daily  exposure  (a subset of Group 3) ; (4) \nother  (not sulfuric) acid exposure only ; and (5) exposure to both sulfuric acid and other acids . \nThe analyses included those who were employed for at least 6 months in a pickling -related job  \nwith at least 1 day of work prior to 1965. Compared with men in the general U.S. population , the \n189 workers with exposure to other acids ( not sulfuric acid ) had a statistically significant \nincreased lung cancer mortality rate (SMR 2.24, 95% CI 1 .02, 4. 26) based on  9 observed deaths.  \nWhen they used a more appropriate comparison to US steel workers, however, the risk estimate \nwas lower  (SMR 2.0 , 95% CI 1.06, 3.78).  No data on other occupational exposures or smoking \nhabits  were included in the study , and confounding by smoking status, e specially, cannot be \nruled out . The authors attempted several indirect adjustments for smoking, with mixed results . \nThe authors discussed  several additional limitations of the study  and suggested that chance \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation  for the re sults.  \nSteenland et al.  (1988) conducted a  reanalysis of 879 members of the Beaumont et al. (1987) \nsteelworker cohort who had  information related to presence or absence of diagnosis of laryngeal  \ncancer (Steenland et al. , 1988). US referent rates , calculate d using national surveys of cancer \nincidence , were used for comparison . Most workers in the analysis were exposed to sulfuric acid , \neither with or without other acids . Two of the laryngeal cancer  cases were exposed to acids other \nthan sulfuric ac id and thr ee were exposed to a mixture of acids ; these numbers are too small to \ngenerate reliable statistical estimates of association . The authors  reported an increased risk of \nlaryngeal cancer in steel pickler workers compared to US referent rates (RR 2. 6, 95% CI 1.2, 5.0  \n(as reported by IARC 1992 ), however this includes all 9 cases a cross all exposure groups ( sulfuric \nacid, other acids only, and mixture of acids).  In its evaluation, t he IARC (1992) working group \nnoted that confounding by sulfuric acid co uld not be  ruled out . The authors compared the \nsmoking habits of their incident cancer  cohort obtained from next of kin interviews  with the \nsmoking habits of the US population in 1965. They found that in their cohort \u201cthere was a similar \noverall prevalence of smokin g compared with all United States men but cohort members who did \nsmoke smoked more than the United States average.\u201d The a uthors also used methods similar to \nthose described by Beaumont et al. (1987) to  indirectly adjust for smoking habi ts, but residual \nconfounding by smoking, in addition to exposure to sulfuric acid in the mixed exposure group, \ncannot be ruled out as an explanation for the results . \nMortality patterns were examined in a follow -up study of 8,854 workers from four Cyanimid \nplants in the United  States and the Netherlands , where 2,293 of the workers were believed to \nhave been exposed to the chemical acrylamide  (Collins et al., 1989) . Each plant had mortality \npatterns similar to other worker populations , and no excess mortality  across all plants was \nobserved for any of the 26 cancer sites examined . However, a n excess in lung cancer (SMR 1.3 2) \nwas observed in one of the four facilities  studied ( the Warners  facility ). In this facility,  11 of the \n63 lung cancer deaths were in a department where there was exposure to HCl (data not \npresented in paper) . This paper was discussed by the IARC working group (1992), who noted \nthat no information for the expected numbers of cases in that facility was provided, making it \ndifficult to interpret that observation . \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 9 A case-control study of brain cancer mortality at a Dow Chemical plant in Texas included an \nevaluat ion of the potential association between brain cancer  and occupational exposure to  HCl \n(Bond et al., 1983) . A total of 28 former workers were identified who had died from brain cancer ; \n13 of these had evidence of HCl exposure  based on a review of job titles . The study  incorporated \ndata from  two control groups  selected from the plant : Group A selected from 110 white male \ndeaths without cancer (42 with evidence of HCl exposure based on job title) and Group B \nselected from a random sample of 111 employees  without regard to vital status or cancer status  \n(51 with evidence of HCl exposure) . There was no statistically significant association observed \nbetween any expos ure to HCl and brain tumors among workers when compared to either control \ngroup (Odds ratio ( OR) 1.40, 90% CI 0.70, 2.80 ; OR 1.02, 90% CI 0.81, 1.29 ). Sub-analyses \nbased on duration of employment focused on those who were employed for 1 -4 years, as there  \nwere only four cases with 20 or more years  of employment . There  was no evidence of  an \nincrease in risk of brain cancer associated with HCl exposure  in this subgroup (cases: n = 5, \ncontrols: n = 15; OR 2.02 , 90% CI 0.5, 8.1) . Note that these authors reported  90% confidence \nintervals, rather than the usual 95% confidence intervals , which increases the likelihood of \ndetecting an association. This choice is usually made w hen the focus is on screening for potential \nassociations  and generating hypotheses to be tes ted in future, more rigorous studies.  \nSubsequent ly, Bond et al. (1985) published a case-control study of renal cancer mortality and \nexposure to HCl based  in the sam e Dow Chemical plant , using the same study population and \ncontrol groups  examined earlier (B ond et al., 1983). The authors  did not observe an increased \nrisk of  renal cancer in workers exposed to HCl (26 deaths from renal cancer; 12 with evidence of \nexposure to HCl based on job title) as compared to either control group (OR  0.90, 90% CI 0.44, \n1.83 based on 44 exposed out of 92 controls ; OR 0.86, 90% CI 0.40, 1.86  based on 50 exposed \nout of 98 controls ). Cases and controls were matched on age, race, and sex, but potential  \nconfounding  by exposure to other occupational chemicals  was not controlled . The authors did not \nobserve substantial differences in smoking habits  between groups and therefore reported that \nsmoking was unlikely to have been a confounder.  \nIn a third case-control study  based in the same Dow Chemical plant, Bond et al. (1986) analyzed \nthe risk of lung cancer associated with  hydrogen chloride  exposure based on job title . There were \n308 lung cancer deaths compared with t wo control groups chose n from the plant : a decedent \ncontrol group and a living control group. Each contained 308 men individually matched to cases \non race, year of birth + 5 years, and year of hire. Separate  results of cases with each control \ngroup were similar, so t he authors pooled the control groups for greater statistical power.  The \nauthors did not observe an association  between  HCl exposure and lung cancer overall  (exposed \ncases: n = 129, exposed  control s: n = 245,  OR 1.02, 95% CI 0. 77, 1.35) or with a 15 year \nlatency period ( exposed cases: n = 108, exposed controls: n = 218, OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.68, \n1.24).  The authors  collected information on  potential confounders and noted the following  to be \nstatistically significantly associated with lung cancer risk , as expected : cigarette smoking, vitamin \nA intake, use of vitamin supplements, and education level . These findings lend su pport to the \nvalidity of the main analyses.  However, due to small number of subjects available for analysis , \nthe authors appropriately chose  not to control for these potential confounders . \nThe Dow chemical worker  population was re -evaluated again,  using exposure estimates derived \nfrom job assignments, duration of exposure , and cumulative exposure  (Bond et al. , 1991). \nAnalyses to estimate the risk of mortality from lung, trachea, and bronchial  cancer  (combined) \nwere performed without and with a 16-year latency period and controlling for pack-years  of \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 10 smoking . There was no  relationship between HCl exposure and lung cancer in any of the HCl \nexposure groups  (see Appendix B) . \nCoggon et al. (1996) investigated the risk of upper aerodigestive cancer mortality from exposure \nto mineral acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) in a study of steel and battery manufacture workers \n(Coggon et al., 1996). The authors categorized exposure as (1) no exposure to any acid mists; \n(2) low exposure to acid mists (<1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid or HCl); and high exposure to acid mists \n(>1 mg/m3 sulfuric acid o r HCl). Based on just 15 cases , the authors  reported no convincing \nassociation between exposure to mixed acid mists and upper aerodigestive cancer mortality in \nany category of exposure conce ntration and duration (see appendix B). The study also evaluated \nthe association of \u201cdefinite\u201d exposure to mixed acid mists (HCl and sulfuric acid) and \u201call cancer\u201d \nmortality compared to that in the national population and found no evidence of an increase in \ncancer mortality  among the workers (full cohort SMR 0.88, 95% C I 0.79, 0.98; never exposed \nSMR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59, 0.91; definitely exposed SMR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79, 1.05 ).  \n \nSoskolne at al. (2011) examined the association between lung cancer and occupation al exposure \nto specific acids (HCl, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, ac etic acid, hydrofluoric acid, phosphoric acid, \nhydrocyanic acid, sulfuric dioxide, and oxides of nitrogen)  in a population -based study  of 178 \ncases and 167 controls in Toronto, Canada . Proxy  interviews provided estimates of exposure \nconcentration and frequency of exposure  based on work history,  which the authors used to \ncalculate an exposure index that factored in the duration of exposure in months. There was no \nincrease in risk of lung cance r for those \u201cever\u201d exposed vs. unexposed  to HCl (OR  0.98, 95% CI \n0.71, 1.35) or for those with low estimated  exposure vs. unexposed (OR  0.80, 95% CI 0.53, \n1.22). The high exposure group  had a non -statistically significant increase in risk, based on 83 \ncases (OR  1.24, 95% CI 0.79, 1.96) (see appendix B). The authors considered all  cancers of the \nlip, mouth, retromolar area, nasopharynx, larynx, and nasal sinus as lung cancer for analysis.  \n \nIn another population -based case -control study, this time in Montrea l, Canada, Siemiatiycki \n(1991) examined t he association s between HCl exposure and 11 differen t cancers ( esophagus, \nstomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung, prostate, bladder, kidney, skin melanoma, and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma) . The target population w as men aged 35 to 70  years who were living  in the \nMontreal metropolitan area. Cases had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the selected \ncancer sites  with the date of initial diagnosis between September 1979 and June 1985 . A total of \n4,576 eligible cas es were ascertained. Data were analyzed using cancer controls , i.e., all cancer \ncases with cancers of sites other than the site being analyzed, and popul ation controls . \nPopulation controls had no  cancer diagnoses  and comprised  an age -stratified random samp le \ndrawn from a list of  all adult Canadian citizens resident in the province that were eligible to vote . \nDetailed job -history interviews were conducted a mongst all cancer cases to classify exposure. \nThe a uthors reported that p opulation controls were interv iewed in a manner as similar as possible \nto the cancer cases.   \nExposure to specific substances and concentration and frequency of exposure  were estimated  \nbased on job categories . Based on this coding, the authors  analyzed the relationships between  \n\u201cany exp osure\u201d and \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d (a subset of \u201cany exposure\u201d) to HCl and each of the \n11 cancer sites , with confounding assessed separately  for each cancer site . Potential confounders \nincluded  age, family income, ethnic origin, birthplace , smoking, alcohol  intake, coffee \nconsumption,  body mass index , and self - or proxy -respondent . After adjustment , there was no  \nstatistically significant assoc iation between 10 of the 11 cancers and exposure to HCl (see \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 11 Appendix B) . The risk of non -Hodgkins lymphoma was highe r among those with any exposure to \nHCl vs. no exposure : OR=1.5  (90% CI 1.0, 2.2 ) based on 90% confidence intervals, which are \nused in hypot hesis-generating analyses because they are more likely to detect associations than \nthe standard  95% confidence  interv al.  \nThe a uthors also evaluated the association between HCl exposure and certain cancer sites in \nsubsets of the population : (1) all ethnic groups, cancer controls ; (2) all ethnic groups, population \ncontrols; (3) French -Canadians only, cancer controls; and (4) French -Canadians only, population \ncontrols . Analyses  within each group were conducted for any and substantial exposure to HCl . \nFrom these eight sets of analyses, the authors reported  results for three cancer sites : rectum, \nlung-oat cell, and non -Hodgki n\u2019s lymphoma (see appendix B). There was borderline  statistically \nsignificant  elevated risk for non -Hodgkin\u2019s  lymphoma in the French -Canadian cancer control s \nsubset (n = 18, OR 1.6 , 90% CI 1.0, 2.5) and  lung-oat cell cancer in the all ethnic groups cancer \ncontrol subset (n = 19, OR 1.6, 9 0% CI 1.0, 2.6)  from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl . When limited to \nthose with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl, results for lung -oat cell cancer remained borderline \nstatistically significant (n=8, OR 2.1, 90% CI 1.0, 4.5) and results  for non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \nwere not statistically significant ( n = 6, OR 1.5 , 95% CI 0.7, 3.2).  The a uthors reported a \nstatistically  significantly elevated risk of rectum cancer from \u201cany exposure\u201d to HCl (n = 18, OR \n1.9, 90% CI 1.1, 3.4) in the French Ca nadian population subset, but this association was smaller \nand not statistica lly significant  when limited to those with \u201csubstantial exposure\u201d to HCl (rectum: \nn = 5, OR 1.5, 90% CI 0.5, 3.8). The very small number of cases and wide 90% confidence \nintervals  around these estimates do not supply convincing evidence of an association b etween \nHCl exposure and risk of rectal cancer.  \nFritschi and Siemiatycki (1996a ) conducted additional analyses on the association of 11 \nsubstances and non -Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma , adju sting for age, proxy status, income, and ethnicity . \nExposure was categorized as \u201csubstantial\u201d , defined as having probable or definite exposure and \nmore than 5 years of exposure at high frequency concentration , or \u201cnon-substantial\u201d exposure. \nThere was no  statistically significant association between occupational HCl exposure and non -\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma  at either exposure level ( substantial exposure  n=6, OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5, \n3.4; non -substantial exposure  n=16,  OR 1.6 , 95% CI 0.9, 3.0). Fritschi and Siemiatycki (1996b) \nfurther evaluated exposure to several chemicals and melan oma. Risk results for HCl and \nmelanoma were not provided, because it was \u201cnot associated with melanoma in any multivariate \nanalyses\u201d (Fritschi and Siemiatycki 1996b).  \nIn a pilot study precedi ng the full study  by Siemiatycki et al , (1991 ), Farrow et al. (19 89) \ninterviewed 39 male and 24 female preleukemia patients diagnosed from September 30, 1985 to \nSeptember 30 , 1986 for lifetime occupational  exposure to specific chemicals , one of which was \nHCl. When compared with controls from a n outpatient ear, nose  and throat (ENT) surgical clinic \nmatched to cases on age and sex, there was no meaningful difference between  cases and \ncontrols (cases: n = 5, mean exposure = 21,000 h ours; controls: n = 4, mean exposure = 5,000 \nhours). The authors did not report odds rat ios for these findings , which would have been \napproximately 1 .0 based on the nearly identical numbers of cases and controls .  \n  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 12 3.3.2  Cancer Studies in Experimental Animals  \nThe carcinogenicity of HCl wa s examined in two chronic cancer stud ies in rats as part of studies \ndesigned to explore the combined impacts of inhaled HCl and another irritating gas, \nformaldehyde  (Albert et al., 1982; Sellakumar et al., 1985) . This combination of gases is found in \nthe degradation of a carcinogen, bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME). Since formaldehyde is both an \nirritating gas and a  carcinogen in animal inhalation studies (Swenberg et al., 1980) , and HCl is \nalso an irritating gas, the  studies reported in these two publications  (Albert et al., 1982; \nSellakumar et al., 1985) tested whether inhalation of the combination of formaldehyde and HCl \nwere more carcinogenic than inhalation of formaldehyde alone . Part of the controls in these test s \nwere groups of animals exposed only to fo rmaldehyde, or only to HCl, allowing an assessment of \nthe carcinogenicity of HCl.  \nIn the ear lier study  (Albert et al., 1982) , a group of 99 eight-week old male Sprague -Dawley  rats \nwere exposed by inhalation to a mixture of 10 ppm HCl and 14 ppm formaldehyd e for 6 hours \nper day , 5 days per week, for their lifetime. Control groups (50 rats per group) were exposed to \neither air introduced to the cages in the same manner as the exposed group  (the \"sham\u201d \ncontrol) , or simply held in exposure chambers without any exposure. Authors reported benign  \nsquamous meta plasia, and two types of nasal cancer \u2014 squamous  papillo ma and squamous cell \ncarcinoma \u2014 in rats expose d to the mixture of HCl and formaldehyde ; these lesions were not \nfound in the control group . This result i s consistent with precious ly published  results obtained \nwhen rats were exposed  to formaldehyde alone ( Swenberg et al., 1980 ), and are consistent of \nthe cancer resulting from exposure to formaldehyde . \nA second experiment exposed groups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats to either inhaled \nHCl, formaldehyde, combinations of HCl and formaldehyde, or a control group of air alone for 6 \nhours per day, 5 d ays per week . This publication (Albert et al., 1982) reports interim results after \n84 weeks ; full results  are reported in the Sellakumar et al. (1985) publication , below.  \nGroups of 100 nine -week old Sprague -Dawley rats were exposed  by inhalation  to either  HCl[g], \nformaldehyde, two types of combinations of HCl[g] and formaldehyde, or a control group of air \nalone for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week  over 122 week s (Sellakumar et al., 1985) . Results \nwere also compared to unexposed control animals. HCl concentrations were 10 ppm ( 14.9 \nmg/m3) in the HCl -only exposure as well as the HCl plus formaldehyde exposure gr oup. Following \nsacrifice, animals were examined for tissue abnormalities, including cancer, with special attention \nto the re spiratory tract (th e site of formaldehyde -induced tumors).  While hyperplasia (indicative \nof cell proliferation)  was evident in the l arynx and trachea of animals  exposed to HCl alone as \ncompared to air controls or colony controls , no excess cancer was observed.  In the groups \nexposed to both HCl and formaldehyde, the cancer response was attributed to formaldehyde . \nTwo other cancer studie s in experimental animals were reported by OECD  (2002) \u2013 a dermal \nexposure study  (Narat, 1925) and an oral exposure study ( Dyer et al., 1946 ). The dermal study \nincluded 99 mice were dermally exposed to an unknown volume of solutions containing 3 -5% HCl  \nevery 1-2 days until skin lesions were observed and then weekly for 4-6 additional weeks (total \nexposure duration 25-46 weeks) (Narat, 1925). No malignant tumor s were reported, and OECD \nconcluded that the study  is not appropriate for the assessment of carcino genicity  because the of \nshortcomings in the study design  (lack of negative control, brief exposure period).  The oral study \nDyer et al., 1946) included was a study designed to examine whether acids present in the \nstomach, such as HCl, would modify the carci nogenicity of 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene . In this \nstudy, groups of  mice (4 different strains) were exposed to a combination of HCl (1-2.5 moles \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 13 per liter)  and either a \u201ccontrol emission\u201d (58 mice) or HCl and 1,2,5,6 -dibenzanthracene (40 \nmice) through a tube inserted into their stomachs (Dyer et al., 1946). Other exposure groups \nwithout HCl were also included in th e study. No excess  cancer or pre -cancerous lesions were \nobserved  in the stomachs of animals from either group  exposed to HCl . However, OECD \nconclude d the study is not appropriate for the assessment of carcinogenicity because of the \nshortcomings of the stud y design (inconsistent strain , short exposure duration , single exposure \nconcentration ).  \n3.3.3  Reviews and Commentar ies Identified  \nHathaway (1997) provide d a commentary that was critical of the methodological quality of \nstudies reviewed by IARC (1992). Among other concerns, Hathaway noted small numbers of \ncases leading to imprecise estimates, shown by wide confidence intervals, and likely \nmisclassifi cation when exposure to HCl was part of a mixed exposure category. Misattribution of \nrisks associated with exposure to some other substance that was part of the mixture could have \nresulted in some of the elevated point estimates reported by the authors if that ot her substance \nwas carcinogenic and HCl is not. Hathaway  also noted inconsistencies in reporting the number of \nexposed and unexposed cases in at least one study , which would affect the results given the \nsmall number of exposed cases available for ana lysis. \nTsai et al. (2016) conducted a review of the regulatory systems and human health effects \ndesignated by the Taiwan government under the Air Pollution Control Act. The study reviewed \ncarcinogenic and non -carcinogenic health risks for designated air to xics. T he study compiled data \nfrom international agencies such as IARC, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and the American Conference of Governmental \nIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH)  and based on this d ata cat egorized HCl as non -carcinogenic.  \n4. DISCUSSION   \n4.1 Conclusions  of Authoritative  Reviews  \nThe consensus  opinion of multiple authoritative bodies is that HCl is unlikely to be a carcinogen. \nIARC classified HCl in Group 3 (not classifiable), which is the cla ssifica tion group used when  the \nchemical is considered least likely to present a cancer  hazard . Note that IARC has only classified \na single chemical as \u201cprobably not carcinogenic to humans \u201d (Group 4), and they no longer \nconsider this category. OECD went further, stating \u201cIn humans, no association between hydrogen \nchloride exposure and tumor incidence was observed.\u201d IARC also reviewed other inorganic acids \nin the same monograph, including \u201csu lfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids\u201d (IARC 1992). \nIn contrast to their conclusion for HCl, their conclusion for sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic \nacids was that \u201cThere is sufficient evidence that occupational exposure to strong -inorganic -acid \nmists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic.\u201d IARC\u2019s overall evaluat ion was that \u201cOccupational \nexposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid is carcinogenic to humans (Group \n1)\u201d (IARC 1992). This is relevant because the conclusion is based on exposure to acid mists that \nmust include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in mixed acid \nexposures, the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to the outcome \n(in this case, surfuric a cid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This likely the \nexplanation for the sporadic effects observed in occupational studies of mixed acids containing \nHCl. \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 14 ICPS did a broader assessment of potential toxicity to the general population and c oncluded that \nother than during accidental releases, it is most unlikely t hat the general population is exposed \nroutinely to any significant health risks from HCl. Furthermore, neither US EPA nor the NTP have \nidentified HCl as a chemical worthy of assessin g for carcinogenicity. Thus, although HCl is a \nwidely used chemical, no au thoritative body has concluded that it poses a cancer risk.  An \nextensive search of the primary published scientific literature identified a total of 4 publications \nnot considered by the authoritative bodies  discussed above. One of these publications is a r eview \nand one is a commentary; two publications are epidemiolocal studies. Neither alter s the \nconclusions of the prior assessments.  \n4.2 Supporting Evidence  \n4.2.1  Evidence Regarding Genotoxicity   \nMutation or genetic changes are often viewed as a first step in carcin ogenicity , so various assays  \nexamining such changes, as well as assays designed to predict such changes (collectively \nreferred to as genotoxicity assays)  are often used to predict cancer  potential . HCl did not induce \nmutations in six bacterial mutation ass ays or one mutation assay  in yeast cells  (reviewed by \nIARC, 1992; OECD, 2002). A qualitative predictive assay that examines cell survival in strains \nthat have or lack the ability to repair damaged DNA had mixed results in two assays but OECD \nconcluded the positive finding was unrelated to DNA damage (reviewed by OECD, 2002) . A \nweakly p ositive response for mutations was observed in a mouse lymphoma cell assay ; these \nresults are interpreted as being an artifact of acidic conditions (pH 6.3 in buffered cell cu lture \nmedium), which itself related to cell death . Other mutation assays in mammalian cell cultures \nwere negative (reviewed by IARC, 1992; OECD, 2002) . HCl induced chromo some aberrations in \nmammalian cells in culture  when concentrations were in excess of 1 0 mM in the cell culture \nmedia  (leading to an acidic environment with a pH of 5.8)  and in a handful of studies in Chinese \nhamster ovary cells, mouse l ymphoma cells, and  in insect and plant  cells in a very limited set of \nstudies ; both  IARC (1992) and OECD ( 2002)  found that the acidic pH  is the responsible  factor for \nthese responses and that  similar responses are observed for other inorganic acids and with acetic \nacid. These concentrations would not be found environmentally14 and are thus not relevant for \nambient air exposures to HCl.  \n4.2.2  Evidence for Inducing Cell Proliferation   \nIn addition to mutagenic  carcinogens, there are some carcinogens that are believed to act \nthrough a nonmutagenic mechanism, often by inducing extensive cell turnover which leads to the \npossibility of replication errors leading to mutations. However, such mechanisms are believed t o \nhave a threshold concentration below which no effects are seen. In the case of HCl, there is \nfurther evidence from the co -exposure study of Sellakumar et al. (198 5), where exposure to 10 \nppm HCl did not cause serious irritating effects and did not enhanc e the carcinogenicity of \nformaldehyde. Thus, there is no evidence that HCl causes the types of cell proliferation that are \ntypically associated with nongenotoxic ca rcinogens.  \n \n14 10 mM corresponds to ~355 ppm in solution or 355 mg/Liter. In comparison, HCl concentrations in the ambient air usually do no t exceed 0.01 \nmg/m3 (IARC, 1992). Conservative m odelling data  (unpublished Ramboll report to National Lime Assoc iation, 2019), pre dicts that the maximum \nconcentration of HCl in the air at the fenceline kiln would be 0.0012 mg/m3.  \nRamboll  - EVALUATION OF THE CARCINOGENICITY OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCl) AND HCl MIST  \n \n  \n 15 4.3 Limita tions of the Existing Literature ( for client discussion only )  \nThe epidemio logical studies evaluated by IARC and OECD  were methodologically limited . \nLimitations included lack of exposure verification or measurement; inadequate control for \nconfounding exposures associated with certain cancers, small sample size  or small numbers of  \ncases, leading to lack of statistical power . In addition, many of the studies evaluated mixed \nexposures and mixed outcomes. The use of mixed exposure groups is par ticularly germane, as \nthe mixtures often included sulfuric acid and other strong inorganic a cid mists , which are \nclassified as carcinogenic. By evaluating mixtures of HCl and these other acids, the apparent \nassociation between HCl and cancer  will be inflated due to the effect of the other acids .  \nIn spite of these weaknesses, the overall conclusi on by IARC based on their review of the \nepidemiological data is supported by the small number of cases of cancers observed in various \noccupational cohorts as well a s by the toxicological evidence that HCl does not have carcinogenic \nproperties.  \n5. CONCLUSIONS   \nHCl has been assessed for carcinogenic potential by multiple authoritative  bodies . After a \nthorough  search for new studies  post-dating those assessments , Ramboll c oncluded that the \nscientific evidence does not suggest  it poses carcinogenic  risks. In addi tion to direct studies of \ncancer associations, we also examined other supporting evidence in the form of genotoxicity \nstudies or potential to induce cell proliferati on. Taking both the epidemiological and toxicological \ndata into account, the evidence does not indicate that HCl is a carcinogen.  \nIARC recognized that sulfuric acid and HCl are often found together in industrial processes. In \nassessing the scientific evide nce for the grouping \u201csulfuric acid and other strong inorganic acids,\u201d \nIARC concluded that there was sufficient evidence  associating occupational exposure to \u201cstrong -\ninorganic -acid mists containing sulfuric acid\u201d with cancer. They therefore concluded that \noccupational exposure to strong inorganic acid mists containing sulfuric acid  is carcinogen ic to \nhumans (i.e., a \u201cGroup 1\u201d carcinogen) (IARC 1992). In contrast, IARC\u2019s conclusion regarding HCl \nwas that there was inadequate evidence  for the carcinogenicity of HCl, and they therefore \nassessed exposure to HCl as not classifiable as to its carcinoge nicity to humans (i.e., a \u201cGroup \n3\u201d). This is relevant because the conclusion regarding acid mists is based on exposure to \nmixtures that must include sulfuric acid. While sulfuric acid and HCl often are found together in \nmixed acid exposures , the exposure contained in the mixture with the strongest relationship to \nthe outcome (in this case, surfuric acid) will drive the relationship for the whole mixture. This is \nlikely the explanation for the sporadic , positive associations observed in occupational studies  of \nmixed acids containing HCl.  \nHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, despite its long history of use .  Ramboll therefore \nrecommends that based on our review of the science and the criteria in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d), it \nwould be entirely appropriate for EPA to base its standard for HCl on a health -based threshold, \nincluding an ample margin of safety.  \nReferences  \nAlbert RE, Sellakumar AR, Laskin S, Kuschner M, Nelso n N, Snyder CA. 1982.

Trinity was asked to review the model \nsetup, modeling procedures and input data to verify that EPA\u2019s approach was reasonable and consistent with the data provided to EPA by the industry.   Below is a summary of our review.  \n Trinity first reviewed the modeling input parameters used by EPA.\n3 This review focused on the facilities that \nEPA had determined were the \u201cworst -case\u201d  and therefore were the basis of supporting the proposed  HBEL.  \nThe three facilities that EPA concluded were the worst -case contributors to ambient HCl were:  1) Cemex \nPonce,  PR; 2)  Carmeuse River Rouge,  MI; and 3)  Carmeuse Maysville , KY. The stack parameters for the two \nCarmeuse plants were compared to NLA\u2019s records as well as prior EPA modeling for this rulemaking. The \nstack parameters were Cemex were only compared to prior EPA modeling. Overall , the stack parameters \nwere consistent with avail able data, even though we did identify minor differences in exhaust temperature \n(<0.01% deviation from available data ).  Additionally, Trinity reviewed the air dispersion modeling \nprocedure (i.e., the modeling techniques and procedures applied)  for developing the HBEL .  We did not find \nany material errors or flaws in EPA\u2019s methodology and the analysis  is consistent with prior methods for \nanalyzing risk for the residual risk and technology review process.  \n \nBased on Trinty\u2019s review, EPA has  proposed an HBEL for HCl  providing conservative  estimates of \nconcentrations in ambient air , the analysis relies on input data from the industry  for the \u201cworst case\u201d \nsources and applied the air dispersion in a manner consistent with accepted practice.  Therefore , we believe  \nthe predicted modeling impacts suppor t EPA\u2019s conclusion that \u201c 300 tpy of HCl emissions per Lime \nManufacturing facility is unlikely to result in adverse chronic or acute human health effects at any facility  in \nthe source category\u201d.4 \n \n \n1  89 FR  28, page 9092.  \n2 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n3 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0184.  \n4 EPA-HQ-OAR-2017- 0015- 0180.  \n \n \n \nMarch 1, 2023 \n \n \nJonathan De\u2019Ath \nNational Lime Association \n200 North Glebe Rd. Ste 800 \nArlington, VA 22203 \n \n \nRE: Proposed Lime MACT Detection Limit Review \n   \n \nDear Mr. De\u2019Ath,  \n \nAlliance Technical Group, LLC (Alliance) has reviewed the series eleven (11) of reports that were provided to \ndetermine industry average achievable Minimum Detection Limit (MDL) for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants \n(OHAPs) testing at Lime Kilns, specifically for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.  Two key considerations of this \nreview were the way in which the MDL was determined in the source testing reports, and the consideration of \nbulk corrections for moisture and oxygen content that are called for in the proposed rule. Brief summaries follow \nimmediately, with more detailed explanations on subsequent pages. \n \nMDL Summary \nIn brief, our position is that EPA selected improper MDLs from the reports by using the standard view of picking \nthe lowest 5.  This inherently selected 4 reports that use a noise value in lieu of a proper MDL, thereby biasing the \noutcome low.  We propose that EPA revisits the achievable detection limit determination by excluding reported \nMDLs that do not conform to EPA\u2019s standards on determining the MDL for FTIR testing. \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Summary \nMDLs presented in reports are a mix of wet (not corrected for moisture) basis and dry corrected basis.  This creates \nsome noise in the data set.  Ultimately the values in the proposed rule do not appear to contain a correction for \nmoisture in the source, which can cause a significant difference in the final result which is to be added to other \ncomponents.  For example, if a measured MDL is 1.0 ppmvw, when reported on a moisture corrected basis from \na source that contains 15% moisture that becomes 1.176 ppmvd.  We believe that especially in the case here where \nresults from multiple compounds must be summed, they should be summed on the same basis, rather than a mix \nof wet and dry corrected results.  As this total result may contain some mix of detected and non-detected \ncompounds, the MDLs used for this level setting should include this adjustment criteria.   \n \nIn a similar vein, as the final results are all to be corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration, we believe some average \nOxygen concentration adjustment should also be made to the MDL values used for the emissions limit calculation. \n \n \n \n \nMDL Discussion \nTwo common approaches were utilized to calculate the reportable MDL in the data submitted.  Both are from \nASTM D6348, which EPA has often regarded as equivalent to EPA Method 320, which is the standard method \nfor FTIR testing of gas phase emissions from stationary sources. Two reports did not include any MDL \ndocumentation and are not included in further discussion. \n \nThe first MDL used in four of the reports is the MDC#1 calculation, which measures the detector noise in a pure \nblank sample, within the analytical region for a given compound.  This is useful to determine the analytical \nuncertainty of a value but is commonly understood that it does not speak to actual detector sensitivity. \n \nThe second MDL used in five of the reports is MDC#2, which similarly measures the noise of the detector, but \nwith the inclusion of major matrix interference.  This is generally regarded as a more appropriate MDL \ndetermination since FTIR is an optical measurement, and elevated absorbances from interference can significantly \nimpact the analyzer\u2019s ability to measure small changes in absorbance (and thereby concentration).  Past EPA \nguidance has indicated that MDC#2 is the preferred approach for the purposes of normalizing data. \n \nThe reports including MDC#1 returned lower MDLs than the reports including MDC#2.  ( Tables 1 & 2 ).  EPA\u2019s \ncalculation of an appropriate MDL seems to consider these four reports, plus one MDC#2 calculated report in the \ndetermination of the proposed measurement limit.   \n \nWe propose revisiting the MDL values considered here to conform to EPA\u2019s standard directive of using MDC#2 \ncalculated results to determine an appropriate aggregated emissions limit. \n \n  \n \n\n \n \n \nMoisture and Oxygen Corrections Discussion \nIn the proposed rule, the value of multiple chemical species are summed to determine compliance with a limit that \nis based on a dry ppm basis, corrected to a 7% oxygen concentration. As such, and values included in the \nsummation must be corrected to this basis.  Therefore, we believe it is logical that for the purposes of setting a \nfloor that includes detection limits, those limits must be adjusted and corrected to match before including them in \nthe sum.  From the reports included in this review, the average combined correction factor results in an increase \nof 22% to the results.  However, we recognize that this is a source specific correction factor depending on the \nmoisture and oxygen content native to the source.  As such, attempting to normalize the emissions limit based on \nadjusted results can have varied impacts depending on the source operating conditions.  Given the variability, we \npropose taking a bulk average correction factor to the MDLs used in calculating the aggregated emissions limit.   \n \nThe data included in this analysis comprises multiple sources in some reports \u2013 in those cases the individual \nsources were averaged for inclusion in the presented table.  Three reports were excluded due to the variety of \ntesting conditions that included abnormally high or low oxygen and moisture concentrations. \n \nTwo separate calculations were performed \u2013 a combined correction factor (CF) determined by separately \naveraging the moisture and the oxygen to determine an average correction factor for each.  These average factors \nwere then combined for a total correction factor.  A second calculation determines the total correction factor for \neach source, then looks at an average of these bulk correction factors.  Both calculations are presented in Table 3.  \nNotably, both approaches result in nearly an identical value; 1.217 for the total combined CF, and 1.218 for the \naverage of total factors from each report.   \n \n\nResult of adjustments  \nUsing properly selected MDLs in the determination, and accounting for the corrections that must be applied to all \ndata for the purposes of summation, our analysis shows a standard minimum reportable concentration of 0.88 \nppmvd @7% O2 formaldehyde, and 0.94 ppmvd @7%O2 for acetaldehyde.  We propose that this should be \nconsidered for the purposes of setting an aggregated emissions limit, and there should be strict adherence to an \nappropriate method for calculating MDLs in the reports submitted. \nPlease contact us at (256) 351-0121 or via email at Jordan.Laster@alliancetg.com if you have any questions or \nneed additional information.   \nSincerely, \nJordan Laster \nSenior Vice President \nAlliance Technical Group \n\n"

Introduction  \nGraymont appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Environmental Protection \nAgency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) supplemental proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants (Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 ) (\u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  Graymont is the second largest lime producer in the United \nStates and currently operates 16 major source kilns in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, \nUtah, Montana, and Nevada that are subject to the Lime Manufacturing National Emissio n \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cLime NESHAP\u201d).  Graymont\u2019s lime and limestone \nproducts are used for purification of air and water, and the production of items essential to \na modern economy such as steel, paper, and metals.   \nGraymont is a member  of the National Lime Association (\u201cNLA\u201d) and joins with \nNLA\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule.  \nII. Executive Summary  \nGraymont appreciates EPA\u2019s reconsideration of a number of technical issues in the \n2023 proposal, including the int ra-quarry variability factor ( \u201cIQVF\u201d) for mercury. Graymont \nis providing additional comment in the following areas:  \n\u2022 MACT Floor Limits for organic HAP (\u201coHAP\u201d) and Dioxins/Furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) : The data set on which EPA bases the MACT floors is extremely \nlimited and reflects emissions that ar e so low as to be, in most cases, below \nthe detection limits.  The statistical methodology on which EPA relies to set \nthe MACT floor is not adequately justified and does not ensure an \n\u201cachievable\u201d limit  that results in a reduction in HAP.  \n\u2022 Development of IQ VF for Mercury : Rather than rely on weighted averages \nof boreholes to establish the IQVF for mercury, EPA should instead utilize the \nindividual samples . \n\u2022 Addressing HCl Emissions Variability :  Graymont joins with NLA\u2019s request \nfor a  health -based emission limit  (\u201cHBEL \u201d), supports subcategorization, but \nrequests that EPA provide an option for continuous emissions monitoring in \nconjunction with a 30 -day rolling average limit.  \nIII. The oHAP and D/F MACT Floors are Not Justified  as Reasonable Estimates of \nEmissions Achieved by the Best -Performing Sources  \n \nThe MACT floor must reflect \u201c[t]he maximum degree of reduction in emissions that \nis deemed achievable\u201d where the standard is \u201cnot less stringent that the emission control \nthat is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 741 2(d)(3).  \nThe standard therefore must (1) result in a reduction in emissions, that (2) is achievable in \npractice.  If emissions of individual oHAP and D/F cannot be reasonably quantified in \n  \n \n2 \n existing stacks \u2014because of the extremely limited test data combine d with repeated \ninstances of emissions that are too low to register in the tests \u2014the resulting MACT floor \n\u201cdo[es] not, as the CAA requires, represent a reasonable estimate of emissions achieved by \nthe best -performing sources.\u201d Cement Kiln Recycling Coaliti on v. EPA , 255 F.3d 855, 865  \n(D.C. Cir. 2001).   In this case, EPA has not met its burden of justifying the use of the \nrepresentative method detection level times three (3X RDL) for the MACT floors for oHAP \nand D/F.     \n \nWhile EPA may rely on statistical too ls such as the UPL method to estimate such \nMACT floors, courts \u201chave not given EPA free rein in its estimation techniques.\u201d   Nat'l Ass'n \nof Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (NACWA ), 734 F.3d 1115, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2013).   Indeed, \u201c [i]f \nEPA chooses to use statistics as a shortcut for meeting the Congressional mandate to set \nMACT floors, it must justify its statistical analysis.\u201d  Id.  This standard requires EPA to \nadequately explain how its estimate \u201creasonably represents the emissio ns level achieved \nby the average source.\u201d   United States Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \n \nGraymont recognizes that the D.C. Circuit in NACWA  upheld the use of 3X RDL when \nincorporati ng non-detect data in the development of emission limits for certain pollutants \nemitted by sewage sludge incinerators.  734 F.3d at 1155.  But in this case, the test data are \neven more limited \u2014particularly for D/F.  Indeed, the existence of non -detects for D/F in \nlime kilns is because  there are no oHAP available to react with HCl in their formation , even \nthough the right temperature profile exists.  Where there are no detectable emissions \npresent, EPA cannot reasonably establish a reduction in emissions that is achievable in \npractice.  EPA\u2019s rough estimate of a total 20 ton per year reduction of oHAP is not grounded \nin reliable methodology and a reduction of D/F of 4.7 X 10-8 tons per year simply equates to \nO tpy. Regulation of these pollutants reflects an exe rcise in futility.   \n \nMoreover, these reductions are based  on assumptions that if  formaldehyde or \nacetaldehyde were present at a 3 X DL value, these compounds  could  be removed by active \ncontrols such as activated carbon or regenerative thermal oxidizers  (\u201cRTOs \u201d).  This is a \ngross overstatement.  Activated carbon injection ( \u201cACI\u201d) is not effective for formaldehyde \nor acetaldehyde removal as these compounds will not adsorbed by the ACI at the stack \ntemperatures encountered (>300F).  Carbon adsorption of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde \nis similar chemistry to methane adsorption (i.e., negligible) at these temperatures and \nextremely low concentrations.  Examining the effectiveness of an RTO, as impractical as it \nsounds, shows it may produce more formaldehyde than it removes, and this is in addition \nto the CO, NOx,  and CO2 it certainly creates and emits from the combustion of natural gas.  \nMoreover, RTOs a re prone to emissions from methane slip, a potent greenhouse gas.  An \nRTO is only useful for high concentration/low flowrate sources such as those encountered \nin the synthetic organic chemical industry.   Thus, EPA should decline to set emission \nstandards for o HAP and D/ F because they are not practically achievable and  are not \nnecessary.  \n  \n \n3 \n IV. Graymont Comments on EPA\u2019s Proposed Standards for Mercury and HCl  \nA. EPA Should Revise its Methodology for Calculating a Mercury Intra -\nQuarry Variability  Factor  \nEPA\u2019s revised MACT floor limi t appropriately reflects an IQVF for mercury ( \u201cHg\u201d), \nresulting in a new proposed standard of 34 lbs Hg/Mtons lime.  Graymont supports the use \nof an IQVF to reflect variability \u2014but urges EPA to use the 77 individual samples as \nopposed to weighted averages o f boreholes.  As discussed below, reliance on a weighted \naverage results in the suppression \u2014and not the expression \u2014of Hg variability, which is the \npurpose of the IQVF.  \n \nThe IQVF proposal was based upon the data treatment of stone samples from two \nMACT floo r lime plant quarries.  In the case of the Graymont data from the Eden quarry, \nEPA utilized weighted averages from 5 borehole samples, which consisted of samples taken \nat six -foot intervals from the surface to 93 feet below ground surface ( \u201cbgs\u201d). \n \nGraymon t\u2019s rationale for utilization of weighted averages was to minimize the \nvariability associated with varying sample depths and to prepare the data for inclusion in \nthe selected quarry modeling software.  From the Geological Quality Assurance Plan: \n\u201cSample da ta, interval and thickness will be broken down further into a weighted average. A \nweighted average will be used to reduce bias from varying sample interval thickness \u201d And \n\u201cWeighted data will be used for the analysis of the location (and) then be compared a cross the \nspecific area and within the geological unit.  The analysis can then be used to determine \nwhether homogeneity exists both laterally (2 -dimensionally ) and vertically (3 -dimensionally) \nacross each specific mining area and unit .\u201d  The purpose of utilization of a weighted average \nwas to suppress variability associated with sample depth (e.g., a sample at 12 feet bgs could \nthen be compared without bias to a sample from 36 ft bgs) and to prepare the sample data \nfor inclusion in the  quarry model that would then characterize Hg concentration across the \nore deposit.  \n \nWeighted borehole averages were an appropriate data treatment for the quarry \nmodeling exercise, which sought to express  the Hg characterization of an ore body.  But \nweight ed averages should not be used for the IQVF calculation because sample averages, \nweighted or otherwise, suppress  variability.  Suppressing variability through averaging \ndefeats the purpose of the IQVF exercise to express the variability of the ore body.  I f the \nIQVF is an exercise to define variability of the quarry, the flawed utilization of averaged \nsamples would result in a suppression of the estimate of natural variability of the ore \ndeposit.  \n \nIn order to accurately estimate quarry variability, EPA shou ld instead utilize the \nindividual samples as opposed to weighted averages of boreholes consistent with the \ncalculation performed by Trinity Consultants in their December 9, 2021 , memorandum \n\u201cProposed MACT Emission Limit Calculations for Mercury from Lime K ilns.\u201d  The utilization \nof approximately 77 individual samples into the IQVF exercise would allow for a non -\nvariability suppressed treatment of the data.  This technique would allow EPA to rely on a \n  \n \n4 \n much larger, quality -controlled set of data and would yie ld a more accurate expression of \nthe ore body\u2019s Hg variability.  \n \nB. EPA Should Provide Operators with an Option for Continuous HCl \nMonitoring with a 30 -Day Rolling Average  \nGraymont joins with NLA\u2019s comments and urges EPA to set a health -based standard \nfor HCl of 300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour.  To the extent that EPA finalizes a \nMACT floor for HCl, Graymont also agrees the subcategorization is appropriate.  Graym ont \nrequests, however, that EPA provide operators with additional flexibility for determining \ncompliance with emission limits. Graymont supports the use of five -year performance \ntesting and parametric monitoring; however, for HCl Graymont requests that EPA  also \nprovide operators with a regulatory alternative of installation and operation of a certified \ncontinuous emissions monitoring system (\u201c CEMS \u201d) in conjunction with a 30 -day rolling \naverage to manage sorbent injection.  \nEPA has broad discretion to determi ne appropriate compliance options, including \nwhen continuous monitoring is required.  See NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1115 (relying on EPA\u2019s \ndiscretion under 42 USC \u00a7 7661c not to use CEMs \u201cif alternative methods are available that \nprovide sufficiently reliable and  timely information for determining compliance\u201d and \ndeferring to EPA\u2019s technical expertise to determine that a combination of annual emissions \ntesting and parameter monitoring meets that standard).  In this case, Graymont submits \nthat EPA should use its di scretion to give sources additional flexibility to manage \ncompliance.  \nIf an operator follows the Proposed Rule\u2019s compliance procedures and set s dry \nsorbent  injection rates, this may not guarantee future compliance with the standard if the \nstack HCl concent ration is variable.  To address the risk, operators with variable HCl \nemissions would have no choice but to rely upon inelegant \u201cset it and forget it\u201d sorbent \ninjection systems calibrated for worst -case sorbent injection rates.  Not only would this \nresult in periods of substantial sorbent over -injection \u2014resulting in unnecessary costs for \nsorbent \u2014but operational impacts could be material.   \nAn additional concern for operators utilizing HCl CEMS as a feedback control loop \nfor dry sorbent control is the potent ial for a short term upset creating an HCl emission limit \nviolation of any 3 -hour block average.  The Credible Evidence Rule requires that a \nResponsible Official must report any deviations or exceedances of emission limits during \nthe compliance certificati on process.  An operator could petition the agency for an \nalternative monitoring plan consistent with the framework of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7  63.8 (f), but it \nshould be noted that such an alternative monitoring plan would not provide the operator \nwith any meaningful relief from short term emission excursions as the form of the emission \nstandard would remain a 3 -hour block average.  \nTo address th e potential for variable HCl emissions from lime kilns, Graymont \nrecommends that EPA provide operators with an alternative 30 -day rolling average limit \nfor operators that choose to install and operate a certified HCl CEMS.  This approach is \n  \n \n5 \n consistent with  the Subpart DDDDD NESHAP for industrial boilers and process heaters, in \nwhich operators that use a CEMS for HCl are exempt from the performance testing and \noperating limit requirements specified in for the HAP for which CEMS are used. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n63.7510( b).  \nAdditionally, Graymont recommends the following additions to Table s 1, 5 and  6 to \nSubpart AAAAA of Part 63 -Continuous Compliance with Operating Limits:  \n Modify Table 1 to provide 30 -day rolling average HCl emission limits for \nsubcategories of lime kil ns equipped with dry sorbent injection that is controlled by an \noutlet HCl CEMS feedback control loop . \nAdd the following to Table 5:  \n \nFor\u2026.

Introduction  \nGraymont appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Environmental Protection \nAgency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) supplemental proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants (Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 ) (\u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  Graymont is the second largest lime producer in the United \nStates and currently operates 16 major source kilns in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, \nUtah, Montana, and Nevada that are subject to the Lime Manufacturing National Emissio n \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cLime NESHAP\u201d).  Graymont\u2019s lime and limestone \nproducts are used for purification of air and water, and the production of items essential to \na modern economy such as steel, paper, and metals.   \nGraymont is a member  of the National Lime Association (\u201cNLA\u201d) and joins with \nNLA\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule.  \nII. Executive Summary  \nGraymont appreciates EPA\u2019s reconsideration of a number of technical issues in the \n2023 proposal, including the int ra-quarry variability factor ( \u201cIQVF\u201d) for mercury. Graymont \nis providing additional comment in the following areas:  \n\u2022 MACT Floor Limits for organic HAP (\u201coHAP\u201d) and Dioxins/Furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) : The data set on which EPA bases the MACT floors is extremely \nlimited and reflects emissions that ar e so low as to be, in most cases, below \nthe detection limits.  The statistical methodology on which EPA relies to set \nthe MACT floor is not adequately justified and does not ensure an \n\u201cachievable\u201d limit  that results in a reduction in HAP.  \n\u2022 Development of IQ VF for Mercury : Rather than rely on weighted averages \nof boreholes to establish the IQVF for mercury, EPA should instead utilize the \nindividual samples . \n\u2022 Addressing HCl Emissions Variability :  Graymont joins with NLA\u2019s request \nfor a  health -based emission limit  (\u201cHBEL \u201d), supports subcategorization, but \nrequests that EPA provide an option for continuous emissions monitoring in \nconjunction with a 30 -day rolling average limit.  \nIII. The oHAP and D/F MACT Floors are Not Justified  as Reasonable Estimates of \nEmissions Achieved by the Best -Performing Sources  \n \nThe MACT floor must reflect \u201c[t]he maximum degree of reduction in emissions that \nis deemed achievable\u201d where the standard is \u201cnot less stringent that the emission control \nthat is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 741 2(d)(3).  \nThe standard therefore must (1) result in a reduction in emissions, that (2) is achievable in \npractice.  If emissions of individual oHAP and D/F cannot be reasonably quantified in \n  \n \n2 \n existing stacks \u2014because of the extremely limited test data combine d with repeated \ninstances of emissions that are too low to register in the tests \u2014the resulting MACT floor \n\u201cdo[es] not, as the CAA requires, represent a reasonable estimate of emissions achieved by \nthe best -performing sources.\u201d Cement Kiln Recycling Coaliti on v. EPA , 255 F.3d 855, 865  \n(D.C. Cir. 2001).   In this case, EPA has not met its burden of justifying the use of the \nrepresentative method detection level times three (3X RDL) for the MACT floors for oHAP \nand D/F.     \n \nWhile EPA may rely on statistical too ls such as the UPL method to estimate such \nMACT floors, courts \u201chave not given EPA free rein in its estimation techniques.\u201d   Nat'l Ass'n \nof Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (NACWA ), 734 F.3d 1115, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2013).   Indeed, \u201c [i]f \nEPA chooses to use statistics as a shortcut for meeting the Congressional mandate to set \nMACT floors, it must justify its statistical analysis.\u201d  Id.  This standard requires EPA to \nadequately explain how its estimate \u201creasonably represents the emissio ns level achieved \nby the average source.\u201d   United States Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \n \nGraymont recognizes that the D.C. Circuit in NACWA  upheld the use of 3X RDL when \nincorporati ng non-detect data in the development of emission limits for certain pollutants \nemitted by sewage sludge incinerators.  734 F.3d at 1155.  But in this case, the test data are \neven more limited \u2014particularly for D/F.  Indeed, the existence of non -detects for D/F in \nlime kilns is because  there are no oHAP available to react with HCl in their formation , even \nthough the right temperature profile exists.  Where there are no detectable emissions \npresent, EPA cannot reasonably establish a reduction in emissions that is achievable in \npractice.  EPA\u2019s rough estimate of a total 20 ton per year reduction of oHAP is not grounded \nin reliable methodology and a reduction of D/F of 4.7 X 10-8 tons per year simply equates to \nO tpy. Regulation of these pollutants reflects an exe rcise in futility.   \n \nMoreover, these reductions are based  on assumptions that if  formaldehyde or \nacetaldehyde were present at a 3 X DL value, these compounds  could  be removed by active \ncontrols such as activated carbon or regenerative thermal oxidizers  (\u201cRTOs \u201d).  This is a \ngross overstatement.  Activated carbon injection ( \u201cACI\u201d) is not effective for formaldehyde \nor acetaldehyde removal as these compounds will not adsorbed by the ACI at the stack \ntemperatures encountered (>300F).  Carbon adsorption of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde \nis similar chemistry to methane adsorption (i.e., negligible) at these temperatures and \nextremely low concentrations.  Examining the effectiveness of an RTO, as impractical as it \nsounds, shows it may produce more formaldehyde than it removes, and this is in addition \nto the CO, NOx,  and CO2 it certainly creates and emits from the combustion of natural gas.  \nMoreover, RTOs a re prone to emissions from methane slip, a potent greenhouse gas.  An \nRTO is only useful for high concentration/low flowrate sources such as those encountered \nin the synthetic organic chemical industry.   Thus, EPA should decline to set emission \nstandards for o HAP and D/ F because they are not practically achievable and  are not \nnecessary.  \n  \n \n3 \n IV. Graymont Comments on EPA\u2019s Proposed Standards for Mercury and HCl  \nA. EPA Should Revise its Methodology for Calculating a Mercury Intra -\nQuarry Variability  Factor  \nEPA\u2019s revised MACT floor limi t appropriately reflects an IQVF for mercury ( \u201cHg\u201d), \nresulting in a new proposed standard of 34 lbs Hg/Mtons lime.  Graymont supports the use \nof an IQVF to reflect variability \u2014but urges EPA to use the 77 individual samples as \nopposed to weighted averages o f boreholes.  As discussed below, reliance on a weighted \naverage results in the suppression \u2014and not the expression \u2014of Hg variability, which is the \npurpose of the IQVF.  \n \nThe IQVF proposal was based upon the data treatment of stone samples from two \nMACT floo r lime plant quarries.  In the case of the Graymont data from the Eden quarry, \nEPA utilized weighted averages from 5 borehole samples, which consisted of samples taken \nat six -foot intervals from the surface to 93 feet below ground surface ( \u201cbgs\u201d). \n \nGraymon t\u2019s rationale for utilization of weighted averages was to minimize the \nvariability associated with varying sample depths and to prepare the data for inclusion in \nthe selected quarry modeling software.  From the Geological Quality Assurance Plan: \n\u201cSample da ta, interval and thickness will be broken down further into a weighted average. A \nweighted average will be used to reduce bias from varying sample interval thickness \u201d And \n\u201cWeighted data will be used for the analysis of the location (and) then be compared a cross the \nspecific area and within the geological unit.  The analysis can then be used to determine \nwhether homogeneity exists both laterally (2 -dimensionally ) and vertically (3 -dimensionally) \nacross each specific mining area and unit .\u201d  The purpose of utilization of a weighted average \nwas to suppress variability associated with sample depth (e.g., a sample at 12 feet bgs could \nthen be compared without bias to a sample from 36 ft bgs) and to prepare the sample data \nfor inclusion in the  quarry model that would then characterize Hg concentration across the \nore deposit.  \n \nWeighted borehole averages were an appropriate data treatment for the quarry \nmodeling exercise, which sought to express  the Hg characterization of an ore body.  But \nweight ed averages should not be used for the IQVF calculation because sample averages, \nweighted or otherwise, suppress  variability.  Suppressing variability through averaging \ndefeats the purpose of the IQVF exercise to express the variability of the ore body.  I f the \nIQVF is an exercise to define variability of the quarry, the flawed utilization of averaged \nsamples would result in a suppression of the estimate of natural variability of the ore \ndeposit.  \n \nIn order to accurately estimate quarry variability, EPA shou ld instead utilize the \nindividual samples as opposed to weighted averages of boreholes consistent with the \ncalculation performed by Trinity Consultants in their December 9, 2021 , memorandum \n\u201cProposed MACT Emission Limit Calculations for Mercury from Lime K ilns.\u201d  The utilization \nof approximately 77 individual samples into the IQVF exercise would allow for a non -\nvariability suppressed treatment of the data.  This technique would allow EPA to rely on a \n  \n \n4 \n much larger, quality -controlled set of data and would yie ld a more accurate expression of \nthe ore body\u2019s Hg variability.  \n \nB. EPA Should Provide Operators with an Option for Continuous HCl \nMonitoring with a 30 -Day Rolling Average  \nGraymont joins with NLA\u2019s comments and urges EPA to set a health -based standard \nfor HCl of 300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour.  To the extent that EPA finalizes a \nMACT floor for HCl, Graymont also agrees the subcategorization is appropriate.  Graym ont \nrequests, however, that EPA provide operators with additional flexibility for determining \ncompliance with emission limits. Graymont supports the use of five -year performance \ntesting and parametric monitoring; however, for HCl Graymont requests that EPA  also \nprovide operators with a regulatory alternative of installation and operation of a certified \ncontinuous emissions monitoring system (\u201c CEMS \u201d) in conjunction with a 30 -day rolling \naverage to manage sorbent injection.  \nEPA has broad discretion to determi ne appropriate compliance options, including \nwhen continuous monitoring is required.  See NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1115 (relying on EPA\u2019s \ndiscretion under 42 USC \u00a7 7661c not to use CEMs \u201cif alternative methods are available that \nprovide sufficiently reliable and  timely information for determining compliance\u201d and \ndeferring to EPA\u2019s technical expertise to determine that a combination of annual emissions \ntesting and parameter monitoring meets that standard).  In this case, Graymont submits \nthat EPA should use its di scretion to give sources additional flexibility to manage \ncompliance.  \nIf an operator follows the Proposed Rule\u2019s compliance procedures and set s dry \nsorbent  injection rates, this may not guarantee future compliance with the standard if the \nstack HCl concent ration is variable.  To address the risk, operators with variable HCl \nemissions would have no choice but to rely upon inelegant \u201cset it and forget it\u201d sorbent \ninjection systems calibrated for worst -case sorbent injection rates.  Not only would this \nresult in periods of substantial sorbent over -injection \u2014resulting in unnecessary costs for \nsorbent \u2014but operational impacts could be material.   \nAn additional concern for operators utilizing HCl CEMS as a feedback control loop \nfor dry sorbent control is the potent ial for a short term upset creating an HCl emission limit \nviolation of any 3 -hour block average.  The Credible Evidence Rule requires that a \nResponsible Official must report any deviations or exceedances of emission limits during \nthe compliance certificati on process.  An operator could petition the agency for an \nalternative monitoring plan consistent with the framework of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7  63.8 (f), but it \nshould be noted that such an alternative monitoring plan would not provide the operator \nwith any meaningful relief from short term emission excursions as the form of the emission \nstandard would remain a 3 -hour block average.  \nTo address th e potential for variable HCl emissions from lime kilns, Graymont \nrecommends that EPA provide operators with an alternative 30 -day rolling average limit \nfor operators that choose to install and operate a certified HCl CEMS.  This approach is \n  \n \n5 \n consistent with  the Subpart DDDDD NESHAP for industrial boilers and process heaters, in \nwhich operators that use a CEMS for HCl are exempt from the performance testing and \noperating limit requirements specified in for the HAP for which CEMS are used. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n63.7510( b).  \nAdditionally, Graymont recommends the following additions to Table s 1, 5 and  6 to \nSubpart AAAAA of Part 63 -Continuous Compliance with Operating Limits:  \n Modify Table 1 to provide 30 -day rolling average HCl emission limits for \nsubcategories of lime kil ns equipped with dry sorbent injection that is controlled by an \noutlet HCl CEMS feedback control loop . \nAdd the following to Table 5:  \n \nFor\u2026.

Introduction  \nGraymont appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Environmental Protection \nAgency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) supplemental proposed amendments to the National Emission Standards \nfor Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants (Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 ) (\u201cProposed Rule\u201d).  Graymont is the second largest lime producer in the United \nStates and currently operates 16 major source kilns in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, \nUtah, Montana, and Nevada that are subject to the Lime Manufacturing National Emissio n \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\u201cLime NESHAP\u201d).  Graymont\u2019s lime and limestone \nproducts are used for purification of air and water, and the production of items essential to \na modern economy such as steel, paper, and metals.   \nGraymont is a member  of the National Lime Association (\u201cNLA\u201d) and joins with \nNLA\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule.  \nII. Executive Summary  \nGraymont appreciates EPA\u2019s reconsideration of a number of technical issues in the \n2023 proposal, including the int ra-quarry variability factor ( \u201cIQVF\u201d) for mercury. Graymont \nis providing additional comment in the following areas:  \n\u2022 MACT Floor Limits for organic HAP (\u201coHAP\u201d) and Dioxins/Furans \n(\u201cD/F\u201d) : The data set on which EPA bases the MACT floors is extremely \nlimited and reflects emissions that ar e so low as to be, in most cases, below \nthe detection limits.  The statistical methodology on which EPA relies to set \nthe MACT floor is not adequately justified and does not ensure an \n\u201cachievable\u201d limit  that results in a reduction in HAP.  \n\u2022 Development of IQ VF for Mercury : Rather than rely on weighted averages \nof boreholes to establish the IQVF for mercury, EPA should instead utilize the \nindividual samples . \n\u2022 Addressing HCl Emissions Variability :  Graymont joins with NLA\u2019s request \nfor a  health -based emission limit  (\u201cHBEL \u201d), supports subcategorization, but \nrequests that EPA provide an option for continuous emissions monitoring in \nconjunction with a 30 -day rolling average limit.  \nIII. The oHAP and D/F MACT Floors are Not Justified  as Reasonable Estimates of \nEmissions Achieved by the Best -Performing Sources  \n \nThe MACT floor must reflect \u201c[t]he maximum degree of reduction in emissions that \nis deemed achievable\u201d where the standard is \u201cnot less stringent that the emission control \nthat is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 741 2(d)(3).  \nThe standard therefore must (1) result in a reduction in emissions, that (2) is achievable in \npractice.  If emissions of individual oHAP and D/F cannot be reasonably quantified in \n  \n \n2 \n existing stacks \u2014because of the extremely limited test data combine d with repeated \ninstances of emissions that are too low to register in the tests \u2014the resulting MACT floor \n\u201cdo[es] not, as the CAA requires, represent a reasonable estimate of emissions achieved by \nthe best -performing sources.\u201d Cement Kiln Recycling Coaliti on v. EPA , 255 F.3d 855, 865  \n(D.C. Cir. 2001).   In this case, EPA has not met its burden of justifying the use of the \nrepresentative method detection level times three (3X RDL) for the MACT floors for oHAP \nand D/F.     \n \nWhile EPA may rely on statistical too ls such as the UPL method to estimate such \nMACT floors, courts \u201chave not given EPA free rein in its estimation techniques.\u201d   Nat'l Ass'n \nof Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (NACWA ), 734 F.3d 1115, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2013).   Indeed, \u201c [i]f \nEPA chooses to use statistics as a shortcut for meeting the Congressional mandate to set \nMACT floors, it must justify its statistical analysis.\u201d  Id.  This standard requires EPA to \nadequately explain how its estimate \u201creasonably represents the emissio ns level achieved \nby the average source.\u201d   United States Sugar Corp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \n \nGraymont recognizes that the D.C. Circuit in NACWA  upheld the use of 3X RDL when \nincorporati ng non-detect data in the development of emission limits for certain pollutants \nemitted by sewage sludge incinerators.  734 F.3d at 1155.  But in this case, the test data are \neven more limited \u2014particularly for D/F.  Indeed, the existence of non -detects for D/F in \nlime kilns is because  there are no oHAP available to react with HCl in their formation , even \nthough the right temperature profile exists.  Where there are no detectable emissions \npresent, EPA cannot reasonably establish a reduction in emissions that is achievable in \npractice.  EPA\u2019s rough estimate of a total 20 ton per year reduction of oHAP is not grounded \nin reliable methodology and a reduction of D/F of 4.7 X 10-8 tons per year simply equates to \nO tpy. Regulation of these pollutants reflects an exe rcise in futility.   \n \nMoreover, these reductions are based  on assumptions that if  formaldehyde or \nacetaldehyde were present at a 3 X DL value, these compounds  could  be removed by active \ncontrols such as activated carbon or regenerative thermal oxidizers  (\u201cRTOs \u201d).  This is a \ngross overstatement.  Activated carbon injection ( \u201cACI\u201d) is not effective for formaldehyde \nor acetaldehyde removal as these compounds will not adsorbed by the ACI at the stack \ntemperatures encountered (>300F).  Carbon adsorption of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde \nis similar chemistry to methane adsorption (i.e., negligible) at these temperatures and \nextremely low concentrations.  Examining the effectiveness of an RTO, as impractical as it \nsounds, shows it may produce more formaldehyde than it removes, and this is in addition \nto the CO, NOx,  and CO2 it certainly creates and emits from the combustion of natural gas.  \nMoreover, RTOs a re prone to emissions from methane slip, a potent greenhouse gas.  An \nRTO is only useful for high concentration/low flowrate sources such as those encountered \nin the synthetic organic chemical industry.   Thus, EPA should decline to set emission \nstandards for o HAP and D/ F because they are not practically achievable and  are not \nnecessary.  \n  \n \n3 \n IV. Graymont Comments on EPA\u2019s Proposed Standards for Mercury and HCl  \nA. EPA Should Revise its Methodology for Calculating a Mercury Intra -\nQuarry Variability  Factor  \nEPA\u2019s revised MACT floor limi t appropriately reflects an IQVF for mercury ( \u201cHg\u201d), \nresulting in a new proposed standard of 34 lbs Hg/Mtons lime.  Graymont supports the use \nof an IQVF to reflect variability \u2014but urges EPA to use the 77 individual samples as \nopposed to weighted averages o f boreholes.  As discussed below, reliance on a weighted \naverage results in the suppression \u2014and not the expression \u2014of Hg variability, which is the \npurpose of the IQVF.  \n \nThe IQVF proposal was based upon the data treatment of stone samples from two \nMACT floo r lime plant quarries.  In the case of the Graymont data from the Eden quarry, \nEPA utilized weighted averages from 5 borehole samples, which consisted of samples taken \nat six -foot intervals from the surface to 93 feet below ground surface ( \u201cbgs\u201d). \n \nGraymon t\u2019s rationale for utilization of weighted averages was to minimize the \nvariability associated with varying sample depths and to prepare the data for inclusion in \nthe selected quarry modeling software.  From the Geological Quality Assurance Plan: \n\u201cSample da ta, interval and thickness will be broken down further into a weighted average. A \nweighted average will be used to reduce bias from varying sample interval thickness \u201d And \n\u201cWeighted data will be used for the analysis of the location (and) then be compared a cross the \nspecific area and within the geological unit.  The analysis can then be used to determine \nwhether homogeneity exists both laterally (2 -dimensionally ) and vertically (3 -dimensionally) \nacross each specific mining area and unit .\u201d  The purpose of utilization of a weighted average \nwas to suppress variability associated with sample depth (e.g., a sample at 12 feet bgs could \nthen be compared without bias to a sample from 36 ft bgs) and to prepare the sample data \nfor inclusion in the  quarry model that would then characterize Hg concentration across the \nore deposit.  \n \nWeighted borehole averages were an appropriate data treatment for the quarry \nmodeling exercise, which sought to express  the Hg characterization of an ore body.  But \nweight ed averages should not be used for the IQVF calculation because sample averages, \nweighted or otherwise, suppress  variability.  Suppressing variability through averaging \ndefeats the purpose of the IQVF exercise to express the variability of the ore body.  I f the \nIQVF is an exercise to define variability of the quarry, the flawed utilization of averaged \nsamples would result in a suppression of the estimate of natural variability of the ore \ndeposit.  \n \nIn order to accurately estimate quarry variability, EPA shou ld instead utilize the \nindividual samples as opposed to weighted averages of boreholes consistent with the \ncalculation performed by Trinity Consultants in their December 9, 2021 , memorandum \n\u201cProposed MACT Emission Limit Calculations for Mercury from Lime K ilns.\u201d  The utilization \nof approximately 77 individual samples into the IQVF exercise would allow for a non -\nvariability suppressed treatment of the data.  This technique would allow EPA to rely on a \n  \n \n4 \n much larger, quality -controlled set of data and would yie ld a more accurate expression of \nthe ore body\u2019s Hg variability.  \n \nB. EPA Should Provide Operators with an Option for Continuous HCl \nMonitoring with a 30 -Day Rolling Average  \nGraymont joins with NLA\u2019s comments and urges EPA to set a health -based standard \nfor HCl of 300 tpy, not to exceed 685 pounds per hour.  To the extent that EPA finalizes a \nMACT floor for HCl, Graymont also agrees the subcategorization is appropriate.  Graym ont \nrequests, however, that EPA provide operators with additional flexibility for determining \ncompliance with emission limits.

Reg. \n9088  (February 9 , 2023)  Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 \n \n \n \nCOMMENTS OF  CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS, \nSIERRA CLUB, AND EARTHJUSTICE  \nSubmitted via regulations.gov and e -mail on March 11 , 2024  by Earthjustice  \nBACKGROUND  \n On July 24, 2020, EPA  promulgated a final air toxics rule for Lime \nManufacturing Plants (\u201cLime Kilns\u201d) that the agency knew to be flatly unlawful. \nAlthough the Clean Air Act unambiguously requires \u00a7 112-compliant limits for \neach hazardous air pollutant that a source category e mits and EPA knew that lime \nkilns emit hazardous air pollutants for which its existing \u00a7 112 standards provide \nno emission limits, EPA refused to promulgate the statutorily-required limits. EPA \nsought to justify its action by arguing it \u201cdoes not read CAA section 112(d)(6) as \ndirecting the Agency, as part of or in conjunction with the mandatory 8 -year \ntechnology review, to develop new emission standards to address HAP or  emission \npoints for which standards were not previously promulgated. \u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960, \n44969 (July 24, 2020).  \n Approximately four months before  EPA published that rule, the D.C. Circuit \nhad already rejected the interpretation of \u00a7 112(d)(6) on which EPA purported to \nrely. In Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020), the Court held \u201c[t]he section 112(d)(6) requirement that EPA, when it \nundertakes its eight- year review, revise emission standards \u2018as necessary\u2019 means \n2 \n \n \n \n that EPA must conform them to the basic requisites of \u2018emission standards\u2019 under \nsection 112, including by setting controls on previously unaddressed hazardous air \npollutants.\u201d Id. at 1098.  Nonetheless, f ully aware that its interpretation of the Clean \nAir Act was unlawful, EPA nonetheless chose to rely on it and, indeed, reiterate it \nin refus ing emission limits for the uncontrolled hazardous air pollutants that Lime \nKilns  emit. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44969. EPA\u2019s action demonstrated contempt for the  \npeople the Clean Air Act was enacted to protect, for the Court that had clearly \nrejected the unlawful statutory interpretation EPA advanced, and for Congress, which enacted the statutory requirements that the agency steadfastly refused to \nobey for more than 20 years.  \nSierra Club challenged EPA\u2019s unlawful rule in the D.C. Circuit, Sierra Club \nv. EPA, D.C. Cir. No. 20 -1381 (filed September 22, 2020).  To give EPA a chance \nto correct its violation of the law voluntarily, Sierra Club also filed a petition for \nreconsideration under Clean Air Act \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -\n0065 . \nNotably, EPA promulgated the illegal 2020 air toxics rule for Lime Kilns \nyears after the Clean Air Act required the agency to issue lawful standards, and the agency acted only after a court ordered it to do so. See Blue Ridge Environmental \nDefense League v. Pruitt , 261 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2017) (\u201c BREDL \u201d). In 2021,  \nEPA returned to the district court and admitted that its 2020 rule did not satisfy the \nClean Air Act or even its obligations under the district court\u2019s order to promulgate \nthe overdue rule in BREDL. Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), Joint Motion to Extend Deadlines under Court Order, \nApril 13, 2021, Ex. A . hereto.  EPA sought and obtained consent of plaintiffs and \nthe court in BREDL  for an extension of the deadline to give the agency a chance to \nbring its rule into compliance with the statute.  Id. The deadline for EPA to issue a \nrule that complied with the Clean Air Act and satisfied the district court\u2019s order was extended to February 23, 2023.  \nShortly, before the final rule was due, EPA sought and obtained a second \nextension of the deadline, to August 1, 2023, claiming its \u201canalysis here took \n3 \n \n \n \n longer than expected.\u201d Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), EPA\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Extend Deadline, January \n23, 2023, Ex. B. \nIn July of the same year, EPA sought yet another extension. Requesting  an \nentire yea r of further delay, EPA claimed  \nSome comments challenged underlying assumptions that EPA had \nmade when it decided, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that the proposal would not have \u201ca significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(b). Because EPA can no longer certify that the proposal would not have such effects, \nthe agency now plans to convene a review panel under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n609(b), invite public comments on an initial regulatory flexibility \nanalysis, and issue a final regulatory flexibility analysis to accompany \nthe final rule .

C  (emphasis \nadded) . \n Despite its representations to plaintiffs and the court, EPA used the \nextension not merely to conduct the SBREFA analysis described in its motion but \nto pursue its apparent policy goal of weakening the Lime Kilns rule to benefit industry at the expense of people who are exposed to Lime Kilns\u2019 toxic emissions. \nEPA did not inform  the court or plaintiffs or the court that it was going to propose \nsuch amendments when it obtained consent for the extension  or, indeed, that it was \ngoing to use the time to anything other than conduct SBREFA analysis.  Nor did \nEPA mention that it was engaged in proposing such amendments at any subsequent \npoint before publishing the weakening amendments in the Federal Register.  \n4 \n \n \n \n COMMENTS  \nI. EPA WOULD VIOLATE THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND ACT \nARBITRARILY BY SETTING A \u201cHEALTH-BASED EMISSION LIMIT\u201d FOR HYDROGEN CHLORIDE.  \nEPA seeks comment on a request by the Small Business Advocacy Review \nPanel to set a \u201chealth -based emission limit\u201d (HBEL) for hydrogen chloride (HCl) \nthat is even weaker than the HCl limit EPA proposed. 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9092 \n(February 9, 2024). It is wort h providing some context for EPA\u2019s consideration of \nthis request. \u201c The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the \nenvironment.\u201d https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our -mission -and-what -we-do. Given \nthis mission, one might expect EPA would be an advocate for \u201chuman health and \nthe environment\u201d  and to represent ordinary Americans\u2019 interests in being protected \nfrom toxic pollution  at least as zealously as it represents business owners\u2019 \neconomic interests . As is plainly evidenced by EPA\u2019s biased and one -sided \narguments in favor of the HBEL and EPA \u2019s complete failure to consider or even \nmention the reasons against  issuing one that the agency  articulated and \nsuccessfully defended in its air toxics rule for industrial boilers, see U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d 579, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2016) , the agency has a bandoned or lost track \nof this mission . \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) provides that, \u201c [w]ith respect to pollutants for which \na health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider  such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission \nstandards under this subsection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4). Nothing in the text of \nthis provision authorizes EPA to set limits that are less stringent than those \nrequired by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). To the contrary, the text of the statute indicates that \nCongress intended EPA to consider  health thresholds, where they have been \nestablished, as a factor in making the limits that EPA promulgates under \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) more  stringent. Indeed, by providing that thresholds be \n\u201cconsider[ed]\u201d \u201cwhen establishing emission standards under this subsection ,\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added) , the statutory text indicates that Congress wanted (d)(4) to \nprovide for more stringent standards. Specifically, \u00a7  112(d)(2) provides that \n5 \n \n \n \n standards \u201cpromulgated under this subsection\u201d must meet the stringency \nrequirements in \u00a7 112(d)(2) and (d)(3). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). Because \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) requires the \u201cmaximum\u201d reductions that are achievable \u201cincluding a \nprohibition on emissions where ach ievable,\u201d reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as authorizing \nmore stringent standards is consistent with \u00a7 112(d)(2). Reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as \nallowing standards that are less stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 i.e., that do not \ncomply with these provisions \u2013 is inconsistent with \u00a7 112(d)(4)\u2019s directive to \nconsider health thresholds \u201cwhen establishing emission standards.\u201d Id.    \nIn the past, EPA has invoked a floor statement by then Senator Durenberger  \nas authority for reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as allowing it to set limits that are less \nstringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). In its 1998 rule for pulp and paper \nmills,  for example,  EPA stated  \nWith respect to the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, \nthe authority to set a standard less stringent than maximum achievable \ncontrol  technology is contained in subsection (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and  other non- threshold pollutants, no such  authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act.  \n63 Fed. Reg. 18,754, 18,765 (April 15, 1998) (quoting Environment and Public \nWorks, A  Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at \n876, statement of Senator Durenberger during Senate Debate of October 27, 1990).  \n \n A floor statement does not trump the statutory text. Because the text of \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) does not authorize EPA to set limits less stringent than those required \nby \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 and strongly indicates that Congress intended only that EPA \nconsider more str ingent limits under these provisions \u2013 EPA cannot rely on Senator \nDurenberger\u2019s floor statement for authority to set limits that are less stringent than \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require.  \n  Assuming arguendo  that \u00a7 112(d)(4) does authorize EPA to issue limits that \nless stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require in some circumstances, doing so for HCl \nwould still be unlawful. As EPA itself explains:   \n   \n6 \n \n \n \n The EPA presumptively applies section 112(d)(4) only to HAP\u2019s that \nare not carcinogens because Congress clearly intended that \ncarcinogens be considered nonthreshold pollutants . \u2026 \u201cWith respect \nto the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, the  authority to \nset a standard less stringent than maximum achievable control \ntechnology is contained in subsection  (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and other non- threshold pollutants, no such authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act. \u201d \n63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (quoting Staff of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at 876,  statement of Senator Durenberger \nduring Senate Debate of October 27, 1990) (emphasis added).  EPA has \nnever altered its interpretation of what \u201cCongress clearly intended.\u201d To the \ncontrary, EPA has reiterated it consistently over the last two decades. See, \ne.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 32,006, 32,031 (June 4, 2010); Sierra Club v. EPA, D.C. \nCir. No. 15 -1487 (filed April 28, 2017)  (\u201cEPA Brick Kilns Brief) , Ex. D \nhereto, at 23 (citing 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, 79,639 (December 18, 2014).    \n Notably, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s refusal to set a HBEL for HCl \nbecause, inter alia, it did not \u201cconsider the potential acute or carcinogenic effects \nthat might be caused by HCl exposure.\u201d U.S. Sugar v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 624 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031). Conversely, where EPA sought to \nset a HBEL for HCl, the D.C. Circuit found EPA\u2019s action unlawful because the \nagency failed to carry its burden of showing with \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl \nis not carcinogenic.  Sierra Club v.  EPA, 895 F.3d 1, 10- 11 (D.C. Cir. 2018).   \nIn the supplemental proposal, EPA does not provide substantial evidence \nthat HCl is not carcinogenic or, indeed, even attempt to provide any showing at all. \nFor this reason alone, issuing a HBEL for HCl would be unlawful and arbitrary.  \nEvidently seeking to evade the holding in Sierra Club  and its own consistent \ninterpretation of the Clean Air Act, EPA claims to \u201cnow recognize[]\u201d that \ncarcinogens can be \u201cthreshold pollutants.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (citing EPA, \nGuidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005)). Thus, EPA seeks to bypass \nthe fact that it lacks substantial evidence to show that HCl is not a carcinogen by \n7 \n \n \n \n now claiming it  is irrelevant whether HCl is a carcinogen and the agency does not \nhave to make any such showing.   \n EPA\u2019s claim to have  newly \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold \npollutants  \u2013 based on a n EPA guidance document from 2005  \u2013 is irrelevant under \nthe Clean Air Act.  Because \u201c Congress clearly intended that carcinogens be \nconsidered nonthreshold pollutants,\u201d 63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (emphasis added), \nEPA\u2019s  views on whether carcinogens can be considered threshold pollutants do not \nmatter.  The meaning of the Clean Air Act does not change just because EPA\u2019s \nviews on whether carcinogens are threshold pollutants change. Where Congress \nhas clearly expressed its intent, EPA\u2019s job is to effectuate that intent, not to subvert \nit, regardless of whether EPA\u2019s views have come to differ from the clearly \nexpressed intent of Congress.  \nFurther, if it existed at all, but see supra, EPA\u2019s purported authority to set \nlimits under \u00a7 112(d)(4) that are less stringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -\n(3) comes not from the statutory text but Senator Durenberger\u2019s floor statement.  63 \nFed. Reg. at 18,765.  That is the only authority EPA has ever cited for this reading \nof \u00a7 112(d)(4). And if that floor statement truly expressed Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA can set less stringent limits under \u00a7 112(d)(4), it would equally express \nCongress\u2019s \u201cclear[] inten[ t] that carcinogens be considered nonthreshold  \npollutants.\u201d Id. Thus, if EPA wants to issue a HBEL for HCl it must establish with \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not a carcinogen \u2013  as the D.C. Circuit has already \nmade plain to EPA. Sierra Club , 895 F.3d at 10- 11. \n Remarkably, the supplemental proposal does not even mention EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute. EPA does not acknowledge that its purported \n\u201crecogni[tion]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold pollutants conflicts directly with \nits own repeated findings that Congress clearly intended that carcinogens cannot be \ntreated as threshold pollutants. EPA does not say why it believes itself entitled to \ntreat carcinogens as threshold pollutants, despite its understanding that Congress \n\u201cclearly\u201d did not intend such tre atment of them. Nor does EPA purport to alter its \nstatutory interpretation, let alone provide a reasoned basis for doing so.  For this \nreason as well, EPA\u2019s action is unlawful. See, e.g. , Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 221- 222 (2011).  \n8 \n \n \n \n  Likewise, EPA makes no attempt to reconcile its apparent current position \nthat the lack of research into whether HCl is carcinogenic is irrelevant, 89 Fed. \nReg. at 9,092, with its previous finding that the lack of conclusive research is a \nreason not to is sue a HBEL for HCl, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031. See U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d at 624. Indeed, EPA does not even see fit to acknowledge the \nposition it took in the boilers rule and the U.S. Sugar case, let alone provide a \nrational basis for departing from it.  \n Even if EPA were free to ignore  the text of the statute,  Sierra Club, and the \nagency\u2019s own long-held interpretation of the Clean Air Act and issue a HBEL for \nHCl without showing that HCl is not carcinogenic, setting a HBEL for HCl based \non the supplemental proposal would be unlawful and arbitrary. Once again, just as \nin Sierra  Club , EPA  assumes it can equate absence of evidence with evidence of \nabsence . See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. The only difference here is that EPA \ndeploys that assumption to claim it can treat HCl as a threshold pollutant rather \nthan to claim it can treat HCl as a non-carcinogen. Compare  89 Fed. Reg.  9092  \nwith Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. See also EPA Brick Kilns Brief at 23- 25. \n Having disavowed any obligation to show that HCl is not carcinogenic , EPA \nnext claims \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic .\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9,092.  Even assuming \narguendo  that EPA can simply bypass the need to show that a pollutant is not \ncarcinogenic, EPA does not and cannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test for \nwhether a pollutant has a threshold, either for cancer of any other health harm. \nEPA does not discuss all the other indicators of whether a pollutant has a threshold, \nlet alone why it has chosen not to consider them.  \nFurther, f ar from providing \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl is not \nmutagenic, EPA makes clear that the current evidence regarding whether HCl is mutagenic is outdated and , at best,  equivocal.  All EPA claims is that \u201c[i]n the case \nof HCl, the available evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect.\u201d Id. That is precisely the same lack of evidence sought to rely on in Sierra Club, \nand falls far short of the required demonstration with substantial evidence that HCl is not mutagenic.  See 895 F.3d a t 10-11. \n9 \n \n \n \n Indeed,  apart from a 1992 study on \u201cbacteria,\u201d  the only studies EPA can \nidentif y indicate that HCl is  mutagenic  in mammals . Id. EPA seeks to discount \nthese studies by claiming \u2013 without providing any citation whatsoever \u2013 that some \nunidentified researchers have found in unidentified research that these results were \ncaused by exceptionally high doses of HCl.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.  EPA\u2019s  citation -\nfree and unsubstantiated  critique of the only mammalian evidence  it has \u2013 evidence  \nshowing  that HCl is mutagenic  \u2013 scarcely  amounts to  a demonstration with  \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not  carcinogenic.  See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10-\n11. \nEPA\u2019s attempt to rely on \u201c[ a]nother important consideration,\u201d the \nmechanisms that can cause cancer, is similarly flawed. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. EPA \nstates that increased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia, \ncan lead to cancer. Id.  EPA further states that an animal study has shown that HCl \nexposure cause s hyperplasia in rats. Id.  Then, however \u2013  just as with mutagenicity \n\u2013 EPA seeks to discount its own evidence by arguing that the  same study did not \nshow that HCl caused the rats to ge t cancer. Id . But it is EPA\u2019s argument that \nhyperplasia, as a purported \u201cmechanism\u201d of cancer, is relevant to whether HCl is a pollutant for which a cancer threshold exist.  EPA\u2019s only evidence is that HCl does  \ncause hyperplasia.  Therefore, EPA\u2019s hyperplasia argument  scarcely demonstrates \nwith substantial evidence that HCl is not  a threshold pollutant.  As for EPA\u2019s claim \nthat the study does not demonstrate HCl causes cancer , it is irrelevant. It is EPA \u2019s \nburden to demonstrat e with substantial evidence that HCl does not cause cancer . \nSierra Club.  895 F.3d at 10 -11. EPA does not claim that its 1995 rat study provides \nsuch evidence, nor could it. Id.  \nEPA next claims to have \u201c similarly recognized the existence of a  threshold \nof exposure for hyperplasia  and resulting cancer outcomes from  exposure to \nchloroform.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092- 9093 The agency claims \u201c[c] hloroform was \nlabeled as likely to be carcinogenic to  humans under high -exposure conditions  that \ncause hyperplasia. However, the  EPA concluded that chloroform is not likely to be \ncarcinogenic to humans  under exposure conditions that do not cause hyperplasia. \u201d \nId. That argument merely underscores the e xtent to which EPA is defying what the \nagency itself describes as Congress\u2019s clear intent that carcinogens not be treated as \n10 \n \n \n \n threshold pollutants. Chloroform is, by EPA\u2019s own finding, a probable human \ncarcinogen.  https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA has \nnever claimed chloroform is a threshold pollutant, let alone identified a threshold \nbelow which it does not cause cancer . EPA\u2019s new suggestion that it can treat \nchloroform as a threshold pollutant is a good example of why OMB cautioned EPA \nthat its new approach was \u201cprecedential\u201d and urged  the agency to seek \u201cexternal  \nscientific review before considering finalizing a threshold proposal. \u201d OMB Review \nDraft at 20 (emphasis added).  \nAlthough EPA did not find that chloroform is a threshold pollutant, as the \nagency now inaccurately suggests, it did find the chloroform is a probable \ncarcinogen based on  evidence that it causes hyperplasia. \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA also has \nevidence that HCl causes hyperplasia. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. Thus, EPA\u2019s new \narguments about HCl are not \u201csimilar\u201d to those underlying the chloroform finding, \nid. To the contrary, EPA discounts the finding that HCl caused hyperplasia because \nthe study did not also show that HCl caused cancer . Nowhere does EPA explain \nwhy, if it believes hyperplasia is a mechanism for carcinogenicity sufficient to \ndemonstrate that chloroform causes cancer  even without an independent direct \nfinding that chloroform causes cancer , it does not reach the same conclusion for \nHCl.     \n Further , EPA states only that HCl cause s hyperplasia in rats.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092.  It does not claim to have identified any level below which HCl does not \ncause  hyperplasia in rats , let alone people.  Thus, even if EPA identified a threshold \nbelow which  chloroform  did not cause hyperplasia \u2013 which it has not \u2013  that \nsituation  would not be \u201csimilar[] ,\u201d id.  \nRemarkably, the record shows EPA so eager to substitute its new views for \nwhat the agency itself has described as Congress\u2019s clear intent that it ignored cautionary comments from the Office of Management and Budget. In its review of \nEPA\u2019s proposal under EO 12866, OMB commented \nHas EPA\u2019s approach here for HCl and under 112(d)(4) been peer \nreviewed by the SAB, since EPA\u2019s action here appears to be \n11 \n \n \n \n precedential? Recommend seeking comment on whether EPA should \nseek such external scientific review before considering finalizing a \nthreshold proposal.  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015 -0201 (\u201cOMB Review Draft\u201d) at 20 (emphasis added). \nThen, after EPA apparently refused to alter its approach, seek peer review by SAB, \nor even seek comment on the need for \u201csuch external scientific\u201d review, OMB requested in a second round of comments that EPA at least take comment on \nwhether \u201c any additional scientific evidence of this health- based threshold proposal \nfor hyperplasia is available that would help inform EPA in their risk assessment \nand subsequent decision -making \u2026 and \u201c[w] hether additional external scientific \nreview is needed before finalizing a threshold- based proposal, since EPA\u2019s \nsupplemental proposed action under 112(d)(4) appears, if true, to be precedent. \u201d Id. \nEvidently, OMB\u2019s comments were futile. EPA\u2019s new approach has not been \npeer reviewed by SAB, and EPA made no effort to seek comment on seeking SAB \nreview, despite OMB\u2019s identification of its new approach to the evaluation of \ncancer risk as \u201cprecedential.\u201d Apparently, EPA did not seek \u201cany\u201d additional \nexternal scientific review or evidence. In any event, EPA does not mention OMB\u2019s concerns in its proposal, let alone respond to them or identify any external review \nor evidence that address those concerns.  \nII. EPA \u2019S APPROACH TO CANCER RISK IS ARBITRARY AND \nINCONSISTENT WITH  ITS OWN GUIDELINES.  \nAs outlined in the 2005 Carcinogenic Risk Assessment Guidelines \n(\u201cGuidelines\u201d), it has long been EPA\u2019s policy and practice to presume that \ngenotoxic carcinogens do not have a known threshold of exposure and thus, no \ndose is safe .\n1 A second practice is that of emplo ying linear extrapolation for  \nchemicals that undergo carcinogenic risk assessment and are found to act via a mutagenic mode of action, unless it can be demonstrated unequivocally that a \nchemical acts via a non- mutagenic mode of action.   \n \n1 EPA, Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment ( \u201cGuidelines \u201d) at 1- 11 (2005),  \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2013 -09/documents/cancer_guidelines_final_3- 25-05.pdf .  \n12 \n \n \n \n Indeed, the Guidelines state that \u201c[w] hen the weight of evidence evaluation \nof all available data are insufficient to establish the mode of action for a tumor site \nand when scientifically plausible based on the available data, linear extrapolation is \nused as a default approach (emphasis added) , because linear extrapolation \ngenerally is considered to be a health- protective approach. Nonlinear approaches \ngenerally should not be used in cases where the mode of action has not been ascertained.\u201d\n2 For clarity on what is meant by \u2018nonlinear\u2019, footnote 3 on page  16 \nstates \u201c[t] he term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used here in a narrower sense than its usual \nmeaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer guidelines, the \nterm \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range \nof low doses that include ze ro) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic \nmodel, which shows some response at all doses above zero). \u201d3 The Guidelines \nmake clear that nonlinear or threshold approaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \nEPA  has not met its own standard in its current analysis, in the absence of a \ntoxicological risk assessment that evaluated HCl for its carcinogenic potential.\n4 \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s proposal to set a health- based exposure level based on the \npresumption of an existing threshold is no t in accordance  with other federal \nguidelines, including the FDA Guidance for Industry S2B Genotoxicity: A \nStandard Battery for Genotoxicity Testing of Pharmaceuticals, states, \u201cCompounds which are positive in tests that detect such kinds of damage [damage to DNA] have the potential to be human carcinogens and/or mutagens, i.e., may induce cancer \n \n2 Guidelines at 3- 21. \n3 Guidelines at 1- 11. \n4 See Guidelines at  3-21: \u201cWhen the weight of evidence evaluation of all available data are insufficient to \nestablish the mode of action for a tumor site and when scientifically plausible based on the available data, \nlinear extrapolation is used as a default approach, because linear  extrapolation generally is considered to \nbe a health -protective approach . Nonlinear approaches generally should not be used in cases where the \nmode of action has not been ascertained. \u201d Footnote at 3 section 1- 11states \u201c The term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used \nhere in a narrower sense than its usual meaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer \nguidelines, the term \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range of low \ndoses that include z ero) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic model, which shows some \nresponse at all doses above zero). \u201d Importantly, the Guidelines make clear that nonlinear or threshold \napproaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \n13 \n \n \n \n and/or heritable defects.\u201d5 Further supporting this approach, a 2006 scientific \nreview article by EPA staff person, Michael Cimino, reported that, \u201cThe default \nregulatory assumption is that chemicals that are genotoxic in standard tests can \ncause mutations in humans (in somatic and/or germ cells), and can contribute to \nadverse health outcomes, such as cancer, via a genotoxic or mutagenic mode of \n(toxic) action (MOA).\u201d6  \nNotably, EPA\u2019s staff co -published a  peer reviewed article  describ ing that \ndifferent carcinogens act via multiple mechanisms or MOA\u2019s and it can be \nchallenging to determine which is the main MOA, especially when considering \ndifferences in exposure at different life stages and at differential doses.7 This notion \nis reinforced  by comments submitted by Joseph Landolph, a n exp ert and reviewe r \nof EPA \u2019s draft Framework for Determining a Mutagenic M ode of Action for \nCarcinogenicity  (\u201cFramework \u201d). While the Framework was never finalized, in \nresponse to a charge question referr ing to the clarity and c ompleten ess of the \nFramework, Landolph \u201cstrongly recommend[ ed] adding that if a mutagenic \nchemical carcinogen does not have a conc lusive mutagenic MOA, but no other \nevidence exists to conclusively document a non-mutagenic MOA, then this \nchemical  is treated as acting by a mutagenic MOA for risk  assessment and \nregulatory p urposes.

IN THE ABSENCE  OF A  CARCIN OGEN IC RISK E VALUATION , EPA \nHAS NOT PROVIDED S UBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT HCL CAN \nBE TREATED AS A  THRESHOLD  POLLU TANT.   \nEPA \u2019s Information Risk Information System ( \u201cIRIS \u201d) database for \ntoxicol ogical assessments for HCl states that qu antitative estimates of either \ncarcinogenic risk from oral  and/or inhalation exposure were \u201cnot assessed under \nthe IRIS Program \u201d.10 Indeed, while the proposed rule makes reference  to the \n \n9 See Exhibits E and F, TSCA eva luation comments submitted by UCSF P RHE  as well as Ea rthjus tice \ncomments published  on docket EPA -HQ-OPPT- 2023- 0265- 0005, which  reference the N ational Resource \nCouncil \u2019s Science and Decisions: Advanc ing Risk Assessment (2009)  and state: \u201c The absence of a known \nmutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other \nMOAs can operate with no threshold. Further, the  NASEM states that human variability, exposure to \nother chemicals, and background disease  processes alone can result in linear dose- response relationships \nat low doses, regardless of  whether mutagenic MOAs are known:  Background exposures and underlying \ndisease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population \ndoses of concern. The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for  \nmechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose- response relationship  can be linear at a \nlow dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease  process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to \nbackground processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a \nbaseline level of  dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the  \nbackground process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That  may be difficult to  \nmeasure because of background noise in the system but may be  addressed through dose -response \nmodeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic \ncancer mechanism can result in linear dose response  relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, \nnonlinear dose -response  processes\u2014 for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor \nsurveillance,  DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles \u2014may be found to  \ncause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background  processes, given \ncancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures  and high variability in human \nsusceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low -dose linear dose -response relationships in the \nhuman population.\u201d   \n10 EPA, Hy drogen Chloride Cancer Assessment ( n.d). Available at : \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=396 .  \n15 \n \n \n \n assertion  that \u201cEPA no w recognizes that car cinogen s can be either non- threshold or \nthreshold  polluta nts\u201d11, Commenters have shown such a statement to be  out-of-step \nwith its own practi ces and policy . EPA  has not  evaluated HCl for it s carcinogenic \npotential. To further demonstrate its lack of substantial evidence, EPA \u2019s proposal \nreference s a single animal study that  was used to derive a noncancer  reference \nconcentration after finding hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa larynx and trachea  in \nrats.  \nThe a forementioned study was use d to derive a  point of departure for the \nreference concentration for HCl and utilized the  lowest observed adverse effect \nlevel (\u201cLOA EL\u201d), which is less preferential when compared to the more significant \nno observed adverse effect level (\u201cNO AEL\u201d) or even a benchmark dose.12 By \nEPA\u2019s definition, the NOAEL  is \u201can experimentally determined dose at which \nthere was no statistically or biologically significant indication of the toxic effect of \nconcern\u201d and only in instances where a NOAEL \u201chas not been demonstrated \nexperimentally, the term LOAEL is used.\u201d13 While EPA did include an uncertainty \nfactor for having to extrapolate from a LOAEL to NOAEL , the critical study used \nto derive the reference concentration failed to identify a level at which no effect \noccurred  and as such, the single study for which EPA is relying on failed to \nprovide definiti ve evidence that a no  effect level ( or a threshold of exposure ) exists \nfor HCl . This  recognition is signi ficant  given th at EPA  argues HCl should be \ntreated as a threshold polluta nt even in the absence  of adequate carcinogenicity  \nstudies.   \nGenotoxicity studies, which are designed to \u201cdetect compounds that induce \ngenetic damage by various mechanisms\u201d14 are not widely available for HCl. Very \nfew studies have explored either genotoxicity or carcinogenicity, and yet the \n \n11 89 Fed.

In \nreality, from the few identified studies evaluating genotoxicity, at least two identified concentrations at which HCl was found to induce a response: in a 1981 \nstudy , the Escherichia coli DNA -repair assay  was positive at a concentration of 25 \nug/well a s well as a s eparate s tudy finding chromosomal nondisjunction induced at \na concentration of 100 ppm in Drosophila melanogaster in 2008.\n15 Chromosomal \nnondisjunction is a phenomena where the chromosomes fail to separate, producing daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. This is also considered a \nmolecular initiating event, which is defined as \u201cthe initial interaction between a molecule and a biomolecule or biosystem that can be causally linked to an outcome \nvia a pathway\u201d.\n16 Molecular initiating events are a sequence of events that go along \nwith the adverse outcome pathway framework and serve as the basis for \ndetermining genotoxicity and in turn, the potential for mutagenicity. The \nassessment of HCl\u2019s ability to induce a positive response in at least two separate \nstudies provides evidence that exposure to HCl is mechanistically linked to potential genotoxic and potentially mutagenic outcomes (which cannot be rule d \nout).  \nFinally, Commenters draw attention to a fa tal flaw associated with EPA\u2019s \nnoncancer risk value for HCl. A ccording to CalEPA\u2019s Office of E nvironmenta l \nHealth Hazard Assessment (\u201cOEHHA \u201d), EPA itself rated its HCl database as \u201clow -\nconfidence \u201d given \u201c(1) the use of only one dose; (2) limited toxicity evaluation; (3) \nthe lack of reproductive toxicity data; and (4) the lack of chronic exposure \n \n15 National Research Council (US) , Committee on Emergency and Continuous Exposure Guidance Levels \nfor Selected Submarine Contaminants.

EPA\u2019S PROPOSED RISK APPROACH TO ASSESS A H EALTH-BASED \nEMISSION LIMITATION  FOR HYDROCHLORIC ACID FOR THE LIME \nMANUFACTURING SOURCE CATEGORY ( 2023) MEMORANDUM IS \nFLAWED  AND UNDE RESTIMATES THE NONCANCER RISK  \nASSOCIATED WITH HCL E XPOSURE . \nEPA has requested comment on w hether its proposed  risk analysis  and \nsubsequent  extrapolation of an  emission limit of 300 tons per year ( \u201ctpy\u201d) would \nprovide an a mple margin of safe ty. In reviewing the Memorandum  entitled , Risk \nApproach to Assess a H ealth -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for \nthe Lime Manufacturing Source Category  (\u201c2023 Memo \u201d), Comme nters have \nidentified several  flaws , including EPA \u2019s unjustified use of a weaker noncancer \nrisk value , its continued underestimation  of noncancer risk s, and its \nunsubstantiated  proposed risk approach.   \nBy failing to use the California OEHHA Reference Exposure Level (REL) to \nevaluate  acute and chronic risk of HCl exposure  EPA underestimates  risks.  \nTo ensure it follows the best available science, EPA should use the latest \nOEHHA risk exposure level ( \u201cREL \u201d) for HCl. EPA has not provide d adequate \nrationale for choosing to ignore OEHHA \u2019s REL , which is an order of magnitude \nstronger than EPA\u2019s RfC.18 \nRefusing to follow the OEHHA noncancer risk value conflicts with the Act\u2019s \ndirection to employ the best available science, and with EPA\u2019s own scientific risk \nassessment guidelines. As EPA admits, EPA has long recognized that OEHHA \u2019s \n\u201cprocess for developing [dose -response assessments] is similar to that used by EPA \n \n17 OEHHA, Appendix D.3 Chronic RELs and toxicity summaries using the previous version of the Hot \nSpots Risk Assessment guidelines (OEHHA 1999)  at 309-312.

Instead , it uses values that are orders of magnitude less \nprotective and underestimates the acute risk by a factor of 100 (see 2023 Memo ). \nEPA\u2019s proposal thus relies on a significant underestimate of the acute health \nhazards of the regulated facilities\u2019 emissions. It is both unlawful and arbitrary, as it \nis misalig ned with EPA\u2019s longstanding practice, an unsupported change with that \npractice, and a failure to apply the best available science.  \nIn addition to underestimating acute non-cancer health hazards, EPA is \nwillingly and knowingly exposing communities of color and low-income \ncommunities to increased and unnecessary harm from short-term HCl exposure. \nThe ERPG -1 is a guideline level calculated by the U.S. Department of Energy that \nrecognizes exposure to a chemical, like HCl, at this limit will lead to certain health \neffects.22 Conversely, the REL developed by OEHHA represents the reference \n \n19 EPA, Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the 2019 \nRisk and Technology Review Proposed Rule  (May 2019) at 27.

As the SAB has \nexplained:  \nThe incorporation of the available California Reference Exposure Levels \n(RELs) for the assessment of acute effects is a conservative and acceptable \napproach to characterize acute risks . The Panel  has some concern with the use \nof the Acute Exposure Guidelines Limits (AEGLs) and Emergency Response \nPlanning  Guidelines (ERPGs ) AEGL -2 and ERPG-2 values should never be \nused in residual risk assessments because they represent levels that if \nexceeded could cause serious or irreversible health effects.24 \n \n23 84 Fed.

It gives no reasoned scientific explanation for refusing to use this value as the best available reference dose here. It must use \nthe most up-to -date and best available scientific information on the risks and health \neffects of the HCl REL in its risk assessment. Doing so will lead to a recognition of \nincreased acute risk from lime kiln facilities\u2019 emissions \u2013 especially if EPA is \nproposing to allow a staggeringly high 300 tp y of HCl emissions based on its \napproach outlined in the 2023 Memo . \nFor c hronic non cancer risk  and where  child -specific reference values are \nunavailable, EPA must consult science on early exposure impacts and use an \nadditional default or uncertainty  factor.  \nThe increased susceptibility of children, while known to exist, has not been \nquantified for many toxic chemicals. Until EPA has child- specific or child- based \nreference values available for a given pollutant, EPA should apply a default or \nuncertainty factor  of at least 10 to account for increased risk from early- life \nexposures for non-cancer risk in this rulemaking and other risk assessments.  \nThis would be consistent with the NAS recommendation on the need for \nEPA to use default factors to account for greater risk,  with the science developed \nand considered by OEHHA, and with the 10X factor enacted by Congress in the \nFood Quality Protection Act.\n25 Specifically, as the SAB report explained:  \nCalifornia EPA/OEHHA has determined that inhalation dosimetry for \nchildren is sufficiently different from adults to warrant a full 10- fold intra -\nindividual pharmacokinetic uncertainty factor (i.e., an extra 3-fold PK uncertainty \nfor children relative to th e IRIS method) as a default approach. In setting non-\ncancer reference exposure levels (RELs), Cal EPA/OEHHA also considers that \n \n25 NAS, Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment (2009) at 190-93, 203. Available at : \nhttp://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12209.  \n21 \n \n \n \n children may be outliers in terms of chemical susceptibility and on a case -specific \nbasis adds a children\u2019s pharmacodynamic factor of 3 -fold, making the inhalation \nrisk for children as much as 10 times greater than adults.26 \nIn addition, Congress has recognized this science in its unanimous vote on \ntoxics legislation passed in 1996\u2014 the Food Quality Protection Act (\u201cFQPA\u201d) \u2014in \nwhich Congress found the need to use, and enacted, a tenfold Margin of Safety, or \n\u201c10X factor.\u201d Specifi cally, the Act provides that \u201can additional tenfold margin of \nsafety for the pesticide chemical residue and other sources of exposure shall be \napplied for infants and children to take into account potential pre - and post -natal \ntoxicity and completeness of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to \ninfants and children.\u201d27 Congress\u2019s recognition of the need to use this default factor \nprovides a model that EPA should consider and incorporate into its residual risk \nassessment.  \nIt would be appropriate and within EPA\u2019s authority under \u00a7 7412(f)(2) to \ndetermine that EPA must similarly use a children\u2019s tenfold margin of safety factor \nhere, to fulfill the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cmargin of safety\u201d requirement. 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7 \n7412(f)(2). In doing so, EPA may rely directly on the science itself, and also on the \nunanimous guidance from Congress, provided in the FQPA, that the existing \nevidence of increased harm requires significant action to protect children from \ntoxic  exposure.  \nFurther, the child- specific reference doses that OEHHA has created for some \npollutants provide support for the use of an additional tenfold margin of safety factor.\n28 EPA\u2019s current reference values for many pollutants are generally one \norder of magnitude less protective (i.e., larger) than the values that California has \n \n26 OEHHA, Technical Support Document for Cancer Potency Factors: Methodologies for derivation, \nlisting of available values, and adjustments to allow for early life stage exposures  (May 2009) at 3 -4, 50-\n51.

See, e.g., ECF No. 55.  \nSince then, EPA has concluded that LEAN  does not affect the scope of its obligations for \nthe risk and technology review of th e Iron and Steel Foundries category.2  But for the other five \nof the source categories\u2014Lime Manufacturing Plants, Miscellaneous Coating Manufacturing, \nRubber Tire Manufacturing, Plywood and Compos ite Wood Products, and Taconite Iron Ore \nProcessing3\u2014EPA has concluded that, in finalizing its  actions, it did not (or for the source \ncategory italicized in the list below, may not have) set all necessary emission limits for HAP \nemissions as part of its final rules as required by LEAN .  To allow EPA to fill these regulatory \ngaps in accordance with LEAN  and without the need for further litigation on new deadlines, the \nparties ask the Court to extend the deadlines to take final action on these five source categories \nas follows: \n2 85 Fed. Reg. 56,080 (Sept. 10, 2020). \n3 See 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020) (Lime Manufacturing Plants); 85 Fed. Reg. 49,724 \n(Aug. 14, 2020) (Miscellaneous Coating Manufac turing); 85 Fed.

Is EPA\u2019s decision to establish health -based standards for acid gas \nemissions consistent with the CAA and reasonable ? \n2. Did EPA reasonably use the Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) \nmethodology to calculate emission standards for sources for which EPA had limited \nemissions data?

Is EPA\u2019s creation of alternative emission standards for brick kilns \nconsistent with the CAA and re asonable, where the alternative standards are each \nexpressed in a different unit of measurement and calculated based on the best-\nperforming sources according to that unit of measurement? \nThe issues raised by Industry Petitioners are: \n4. Is BIA barred from challenging EPA\u2019s inclusion  of synthetic area source \ndata in MACT floor calculations?  And if reviewable, d id EPA reasonably include \nemissions information from synthetic area sources in calculating the MACT floors to \nset standards for ma jor sources?  \n5. Did EPA adequately justify the MACT floors for particulate matter \n(\u201cPM\u201d) and non-mercury metals for brick industry sources and reasonably estimate \nthe emissions from the best-performing  12 percent of sources?  \n6. Did EPA comply with the CAA in setting mercury standards for sources \nin the brick industry , and in declining to subcategorize based on the mercury content \nof raw materials?  \n7. Does Petitioner TCNA lack standing to challenge the tile industry \nstandards and EPA\u2019s decision to list a maj or source category which includes the tile \nindustry , where TCNA has not shown that any of its members would be injured by \nthe standards for that category ?

Does EPA have authority to set standards for major sources in the tile \nindustry when , at the time the standards are proposed and issued , there are no sources \nin the category that would be subject to the standards?  \n9. Is TCNA  barred from challenging EPA\u2019s decision to list a major source \ncategory including ceramic  tile sources?  And if reviewable, did EPA adequately \nsupport the listing of a major source category that includes tile sources?  \n10. Did EPA reasonably rely on reported emission  levels that were measured \nusing an established test method  to set standards for dioxin/furan for tile industry \nsources? \n11. Did EPA reasonably decline to include malfunction data in setting \nstandards for the tile industry? \n12. Are EPA\u2019s standards for ceramic tile sources reasonable where such \nstandards are set at MACT floor levels and where EPA has neither required the use  of \na specific control technology nor set standards based on a beyond -the-floor analysis?  \n13. Did EPA reasonably base its MACT floor calculations for sanitaryware \nsources in part on emissions information from a source operating with emission \ncontrols that the source is not required to use? \nPERTINENT STATUTES A ND REGULATIONS  \nPertinent statutes and regulations appear in Petitioners\u2019 briefs and Addendums \nthereto .  Additional statutes are included in a separate addendum.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 18 of 135\n-4- \n STATEMENT OF THE CASE  \nA. Statutory Backgrou nd \nThe Brick/Clay Rule regulates the emissions of hazardous air pollutants \n(\u201cHAPs \u201d) pursuant to CAA section  112, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412.  As amended in 1990, \nsection 7412 directs EPA to regulate HAP emissions utilizing technology -based \nstandards.  Sierra Club v.  EPA , 353 F.3d 976, 979 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  In the 1990 \namendments, Congress designated 189 HAPs that it deemed to be hazardous and \ntherefore subject to regulation .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1) .  Congress also required  \nEPA to identify the categories of sourc es of each HAP , id. \u00a7 7412(c),  and to set \nemission limits for each major stationary source , id. \u00a7 7412(d)(1) .  The statute defines \nmajor sources as those that emit or have the potential to emit considering controls \nmore than ten tons per year of any covere d HAP, or more than twenty -five tons per \nyear of any combination of HAPs.  Id.  \u00a7 7412(a)(1).   Sources that emit lower levels of \nHAPs are classified as \u201carea sources.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(2).    \nFor major sources, section 7412 requires EPA to establish national e mission \nstandards for listed  categories for both new and existing major sources .  These \nstandards are ordinarily  promulgated under section 7412(d) and \u201crequire the \nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to \nthis sec tion (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable)\u201d that the \nAdministrator determines is achievable based on existing technology, taking into consideration cost and other specific factors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  These emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 19 of 135\n-5- \n standards are referred to as \u201cmaximum achievable control technology\u201d or \u201cMACT\u201d \nstandards.  \nTo establish MACT standards, EPA follows a two -step process.   U.S. Sugar \nCorp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  First, EPA establishes a \u201cMACT \nfloor,\u201d which is the absolute minimum level of emissions reductions covered sources \nmust achieve.  Mossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1235 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  The MACT floor is based on what level of emissions limitation has been \nachieved within the source category .  For new sources, the MACT floor is \u201cthe \nemission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  The MACT floor for \nexisting sources in categories or subcategories with 30 or more sources is \u201cthe average \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing  12 percent of the existing sources \n(for which the Administrator has emission s information).\u201d  Id.  Where there are fewer \nthan 30 sources in a category of subcategory, the MACT floor is determined based on \nthe best-performing 5 sources.  Id.  Second, EPA has the discretion to set standards \nthat are more stringent  than the MACT floor (known as beyond -the-floor  standards) \nthat EPA determines are achievable \u201cta king into consideration the cost of achieving \nsuch emissions reduction, and any non -air quality health and environmental impacts \nand energy requirements.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(2) ; see U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594-95.  \nEPA has extensive discretion to determine whether and  how to collect data and \nto decide how to identify and assess relevant data when  establishing emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 20 of 135\n-6- \n standards.  Cement Kiln Recycling Coal . v. EPA, 255 F.3d 855, 867 (D.C. Cir. 2001) .  \nEPA may use estimates of emission levels that have been achie ved or are achievable, \nand may account for variability of a source\u2019s emissions.  Mossville, 370 F.3d at 1240- 42; \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 632.  \u201cFloors need not be perfect mirrors of the best -\nperformers\u2019 emissions . . . [but instead are to] reflect a reason able estimate of the \nemissions \u2018achieved\u2019 in practice by the best -performing sources.\u201d  Cement Kiln, 255 \nF.3d at 871 -72 (citations omitted). \nUnder certain circumstances, section 7412 allows  EPA to  exercise its discretion \nto promulgate standards other than numeric MACT emission limitations.  First, EPA \nhas discretion to promulgate \u201chealth -based\u201d emission limits  pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4) .  When section 7412 was first enacted, it required EPA to identify and \nregulate HAPs when they were found to \u201ccause, or contribute to, an increase in \nmortality or an increase in serious irreversible [ ] or incapacitating reversible [ ] \nillness.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 91 -604, \u00a7 4(a), 84 Stat. 1676, 1685 (1970), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) \n(1970).  Congre ss amended section 7412 in 1990 to direct the use of technology -based \nstandards b ecause the  prior  health -based standards proved ex ceedingly difficult to \ngenerate.  NRDC v. EPA, 529 F.3d 1077, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 2008).   \nBy contrast, section 7412(d)(4) provide s, \u201cWith respect to pollutants for which \na health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 21 of 135\n-7- \n under this subsection.\u201d1  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4).  A s EPA explained, \u201cThis provision \nis intended to allow the EPA to establish emission standards other than technology -\nbased MACT standards, in cases where an alternative emission standard will still \nensure that the health threshold will not be exceeded, with  an ample margin of \nsafety.\u201d  NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing; and \nNESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufac turing; Proposed Rules, 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, \n75,638/3 (Dec. 18, 2014) .     \nSecond, if EPA determines that it is \u201cnot feasible\u201d  (as defined in section \n7412(h)(2))  to prescribe or enforce a numeric MACT standard, it may instead \npromulgate a design, equipment, work p ractice or operational standard.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(h).

Pursuant to a consent decree establishing deadlines \nfor the proposal and promulgation of standards, EPA issued a proposed rule on December 18, 2014, 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, and promulgated the final Brick/Clay Rule \non October 26, 2015 .  80 Fed. Reg. 65,470.  \nFollowing publication of the Brick/Clay Rule, the Industry Petitioners each \nsubmitted petitions for administrative reconsideration.  On May 1 2, 2016, EPA \ndenied BIA and TCNA\u2019s  petitions , and granted in part and denied in part Kohler\u2019s \npetition.  81 Fed. Reg. 31,234  (May 18, 2016) . \nThe Brick/Clay Rule establishes emission limitations for two  major source \ncategories: brick and structural clay products manufacturing (the \u201cBrick Rule\u201d), and \nclay ceramics manufacturing (the \u201cClay Rule\u201d).  The brick and structural clay products \nsource category include s manufacturers of brick, clay pipe, roof tile, extru ded floor \nand wall tile, and other extruded, dimensional clay products.  80 Fed.

I n \ngeneral, EPA  set three types of standards:  (1) numeric emission limitations at the \nMACT floor level; (2) health -based numeric emission limitations, pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4); and (3) non -numeric work practice standards.  The specific requirements \nchallenged in this case are discussed below in the sections of the argument that relate \nto each requirement.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nThis case presents challenges to the Brick/Clay Rule from two sides.  On the \none hand, Environmental Petitioners argue that the rule is not sufficiently protective \nof public health .  They challenge  health -based standards  set pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4), emission  limits calculated using an established statistical methodology, and \nthe flexibility afforded to industry to choose  standards that are  all calculated based on \nthe best-performing sources.  On the other hand, Industry Petitioners argue that the \nrule is overly stringent  for a litany of reasons largely relating to the data EPA \nconsidered in setting the standards for brick and  clay ceramics manufacturing \nfacilities.  Neither side is right.  \nA. Environmental Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n1. EPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for acid gases \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  The statute does not specify what it means when a \nhealth threshold \u201chas been established,\u201d and the concept of an \u201cestablished\u201d threshold is unique to section 7412(d)(4).  The identification of an \u201cestablished\u201d USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 24 of 135\n-10- \n health threshold in the same rulemaking in which EPA set health -based emission \nlimits is fully consistent with the plain language of the CAA.  EPA was not required to \naffirmatively conclude that the acid gases were not carcinogens before invoking section 7412(d)(4).  Petitioners\u2019 argument to the contrary misunderstands the nature of scientific uncertainty and how EPA must address such uncertainty when regulating.  \nAdditionally, EPA thoroughly analyzed the best available scientific information, \nincluding well -established, peer -reviewed toxicity databases, to determine that the  \nthree pollutants all had health thresholds.  Furthermore, EPA appropriately \nconsidered evidence and classification of carcinogenic risk in considering whether \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  had health thresholds .  EPA \nprovided adequate support for the specific health threshold levels it identified , and  \nEPA\u2019s technical judgments are entitled to the highest level of deference .  Finally, \nEPA\u2019s health -based standards include an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d as required by \nsection 7412(d)(4) because EPA  built a margin of safety into its process for translating \nthe acid gas health thresholds into emission limits by including several conservative assumptions in its emissions modeling.   This approach is consistent with the statute, \nand EPA fully explained why it expected this approach to result in exposure \nconcentrations well below the identified threshold values. \n2. EPA\u2019s use of the Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) methodology to \naccount for variability in calculating MACT floors for which the Agency had limited emissions data was reasonable.  This Court has affirmed EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 25 of 135\n-11- \n general matter, and EPA has sufficiently articulated a process for ensuring that the \napplication of the methodology to limited datasets still results in a reasonable estimate of the emissio ns achieved in practice by the best-performing sources in each \nsubcategory.  Moreover, EPA followed that process here, which resulted in adjustments to five of the MACT floors for brick kilns to more accurately account for \nthe distribution of data .  EPA ad equately explained the basis for all five of those \nadjustments.  Additionally, the upward adjustment of two of those floors was related to the addition of a raw material variability factor, which Petitioners do not challenge and which was not part of the U PL limited dataset analysis.  Furthermore  EPA may \nmake either upward or downward adjustments to its MACT floor calculations if it \ndetermines based on its limited dataset analysis that such adjustments are necessary. \n3. EPA\u2019s promulgation of alternative emi ssion limits for mercury and non -\nmercury metals for brick tunnel kilns was both consistent with the statute and \nreasonable.  Nothing in the plain language of section 7412(d) forbids EPA from promulgating multiple alternative MACT standards, so long as thos e standards require \nthe maximum degree of emission reduction and are based on the best-performing source or sources.  Because each floor was determined based on the best-performing \nsources according to the unit of measurement in which the floor is expresse d, the \nalternative floors are all based on the best-performing sources and satisfy the \nrequirements of section 7412(d)(3).  EPA\u2019s method for calculating the alternative \nlimits was therefore reasonable.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 26 of 135\n-12- \n B. Industry Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n4. BIA\u2019s challenge to EPA\u2019s inclusion  of synthetic area source  data is \nbarred because BIA did not challenge the approach when EPA first used it in the \n2003 Rule.  In any case, EPA properly included emissions data from synthetic area \nsources, which would emit HAPs at major source levels but for their federally -\nenforceable controls, in determining the MACT floors for PM and mercury emission s \nfrom brick kilns.  EPA\u2019s use of such data is consistent with the statutory requirement \nto determine MACT floors based on e mission levels achieved by the \u201cbest \nperforming\u201d sources.  Inclusion of synthetic area sources in the MACT floor \ncalculations is consistent with the CAA, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA \npolicy.  \n5. EPA\u2019s determination to base the PM and non -mercu ry HAP metal \nstandards for brick industry sources on the top 12 percent of sources for which it had emissions data was consistent with the statute and reasonable.  EPA\u2019s other proposed approach, preferred by BIA, would have set standards based on the top 1 2 percent of \nthe total number of sources in the category.  If EPA had used that approach, it would \nhave needed to ensure that it had emissions data from all the best -performing sources \nin the category .  In the final rule, EPA  appropriately rejected BIA\u2019s p referred \napproach because EPA had no basis to conclude that it had data from all of the \nsources comprising the best-performing 12 percent of the entire industry . USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 27 of 135\n-13- \n 6. EPA appropriately set mercury standards for brick kilns at the MACT \nfloor levels based on w hat the best-performing sources actually achieved.  EPA did \nnot and could not consider other factors when calculating the MACT floor.  The \nstandards are not based on any specific control method, and leave sources with flexibility as to the methods for achi eving compliance.  Further, in setting the mercury \nstandards for sources in the brick industry, EPA reasonably declined to subcategorize \nbased on raw material content, and legislative history regarding EPA\u2019s ability to consider raw material switching is no t applicable here.   \n7. TCNA has not adequately demonstrated that it has standing to challenge \nthe standards and the major source category listing of tile industry sources.  In arguing that EPA impermissibly promulgated standards for a source category that includes no \nmajor sources, TCNA fails to allege that any of its members have suffered a cognizable injury.   \n8. EPA has authority to set standards for tile industry sources, and its \npromulgation of such standards was proper even in the absence of sources that would \nbe subject to the standards at the time of proposal or promulgation.  The tile industry sources are part of a source category listed pursuant to section 7412(c), and EPA is required to set standards for listed source categories.  EPA reasonably set major source standards for the tile industry because major sources existed in the industry when the category was listed, and because existing synthetic area sources and area sources could increase emissions to become subject to the major source standar ds. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 28 of 135\n-14- \n 9. The CAA provides for judicial review of EPA\u2019s listing of a major source \ncategory at the time standards are issued for the category.  Because EPA issued major \nsource standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2003, challenges to the li sting should have been brought at that time.  N o challenges to the listing were \nbrought within 60 days of the date the standard was issued, so TCNA\u2019s challenge to \nthe listing is now untimely, and the vacatur of the prior standards does not provide \nanother opportunity to challenge the listing.  In any case, EPA\u2019s listing of the category \nthat includes the tile industry was consistent with the CAA and adequately supported.  \n10. EPA\u2019s reliance on information from tile industry sources collected using \nan establi shed EPA test method, Method 23, to calculate MACT floors for \ndioxin/furan is consistent with the CAA\u2019s requirement that EPA calculate MACT floors based on the best -performing sources for which it has emissions information.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that Method 23 does not provide reliable \u201cemissions information\u201d \nis without merit.  Whether results from Method 23 are appropriate to use in setting \ndioxin/furan emission standards is a decision squarely within the A gency\u2019s expertise, \nand EPA reasonably concluded that Me thod 23 results are reliable and appropriately \nconsidered here.  \n11. EPA reasonably did not include data from periods of malfunction when \nestablishing standards for the tile industry.  To estimate emission levels of the best-performing sources, EPA relied on test data collected from those sources and accounted for variability in their actual operations.  Because malfunctions are USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 29 of 135\n-15- \n unpredictable events with unpredictable effects on emissions, EPA reasonably \ndetermined that information gathered during malfuncti ons was not useful in \ndetermining the MACT floors or otherwise setting standards.   \n12. EPA reasonably set standards for tile industry  mercury and dioxin/furan \nemissions based on the MACT floor.  TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA impermissibly \nconsidered the effect iveness of activated carbon injection controls in setting these \nstandards is misplaced.  EPA did not set them based on anything other than what tile \nsources have actually achieved.  \n13. EPA permissibly calculated the MACT floors for sanitaryware sources \nbased in part on data collected from a source using controls built to comply with the \nvacated 2003 Rule.  Kohler\u2019s argument that use of this data in setting standards was impermissible is without merit.  Vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not erase the actual \nemission reductions that sources had achieved.  Because the CAA requires that EPA \nbase the MACT floors on emission levels that have been achieved, and emissions data using controls demonstrated the emission levels achieved, EPA reasonably considered this data.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nChallenged portions of the Brick/Clay Rule  may not be set aside unless they \nare \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nthe law.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(9).

Id . at 843 & n.11.  \nARGUMENT  \nI. EPA reasonably set health- based emission limits for a cid gases pursuant \nto section 7412(d)(4).  \nIn order for EPA to invoke section 7412(d)(4) and adopt a standard more \nlenient than the MACT floor for a pollutant, two requirements must be met:  (1) there \nmust be an established health thresh old; and (2) the health -based standards must \nprovide an ample margin of safety.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4).  In the Brick/Clay  Rule, \nEPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for three acid gases \n(hydrogen fluoride , hydrogen chloride , and chlorine ) for all existing and new brick \ntunnel k ilns and clay ceramics roller and tunnel kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,471, 65, 474, \n65,478.   \nFirst, before deciding to set health -based standards, EPA appropriately \ndetermined, based on the best available toxicity information, that each of the three pollutants ha s a health threshold.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  For all three pollutants, \nEPA :  (1) evaluated the carcinogenic and non-cancer health effects based on  existing \nscientific literature; (2) identified a health benchmark below which adverse ef fects are \nnot expected to occur; and (3) provided a rationale for their designation as threshold \npollutants.  See id. at 65,488/2-89/1; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41 .  EPA then assessed \nthe suitability of setting  a health -based standard specifically for brick and  clay USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 32 of 135\n-18- \n ceramics facilities , considering whether setting technology -based standards would \nresult in significant reductions in emissions of other pollutants, the potential for \nenvironmental impacts, the potential for cumulative adverse health effects in light of \nother co -located or nearby sources that also emit pollutants, and the availability of \nindustry -specific data to determine a standard .  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,495/3-98/3; 79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,641/2 -42/3 , 75,660/1 -61/1 .  Finally, in determining the appropriate  \nlevel of the health -based standards, EPA developed risk assessments and used \nmodeling to ensure that the established emission limit s would provide an ample \nmargin of safety, and that persons exposed to emissions of the pollutants would not experience the adverse health effects on which the health thresholds are based.  80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,498/3- 65,505/3; 79 Fed. Reg.  at 75,643/1 -44/2 .  This approach is \nconsistent with previous actions in which the Agency promulgated or considered promulgating health- based standards.

Reg. 54,970, 54 ,985/3-87/2 (Sept. \n9, 2010) . \nEnvironmental Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the hea lth-based standards  should be \nrejected.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the requirement that a health threshold \u201chas \nbeen established\u201d  misreads section 7412(d)(4) and misunderstands  how EPA \naddress es scientific uncertainty in the consideration of the potential health effects of a \npollutant.  It also disregards the fact that EPA set such standards after thoroughly \nanalyzing the best available s cientific information in a highly technical field , basing its \ndeterminations on rigorously vetted toxicity assessments of acid gases and adequately \nsupporting both its conclusion that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen \nfluoride had established health thresholds, and the specific threshold values it \nidentified for each pollutant.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 argument fails to account for the \nmethod EPA used to translate its identified health threshold values into emission \nlimitations that provide an ample m argin of safety.  \nA. EPA reasonably construed section 7412(d)(4) . \nSection 7412(d)(4) provides that EPA may establish health -based emission \nstandards \u201c[w]ith respect to pollutants for which a health threshold has been \nestablished.\u201d  The concept of a \u201chealth threshold [that] has been established\u201d is \nunique to section 7412(d)(4).  EPA does not make findings under the CAA regarding USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 34 of 135\n-20- \n the existence of a \u201chealth threshold\u201d outside the context of determining whether to \nset health -based emissi on limit s under this subsection.  Nor does the statute explain  \nwhat constitutes an \u201cestablished\u201d health threshold, or what EPA must do to determine that a health threshold \u201chas been established.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  \nAdditionally, by using the passi ve voice, the statute does not specify who  must \nestablish the health threshold.  Id.   Acco rdingly, the precise meaning of the phrase \n\u201chas been established\u201d is ambiguous.  \nHere, EPA reasonably interprets the phrase \u201chas been established\u201d as \nauthorizing EPA to identify a health threshold for a particular pollutant as part of a rulemaking establishing emission standards.  As the Agency explained , \u201c[i]n the \nabsence of such specificity in the statute, the EPA reads [section 7412(d)(4)] to authorize the EPA to se t health -based limits where, in the EPA\u2019s expert judgment, \nthere is a health threshold for the pollutant below which no adverse health effects are \nexpected to occur.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  Applying this interpretation, EPA \nappropriately determined in the Brick/Clay  Rule that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  all had established health thresholds.  As further explained infra  in \nSection I.B, the analysis suppo rting the r ule includes an evaluation of the available and \nrelevant scientific evidence on the cancer risk and non -cancer health effects of each \npollutant.  See id. at 65,488-89; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41 .  That evidence included \nhuman health  values derived as part of several agenci es\u2019 toxicity assessments, and \nwhich EPA used in identifying  health threshold values for each pollutant.   See 79 Fed. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 35 of 135\n-21- \n Reg. at 75,639/3-40 .  EPA\u2019s approach of concluding in the Brick/Clay Rule that \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  were thre shold pollutants based \non existing toxicity assessments was reasonable.  Nothing in section 7412(d)(4) \nprecludes EPA from determining that a health threshold has been established for pollutants as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -\nbased emission standard.  See Chevron , 467 U.S. at 842- 43 (holding that where a statute \nis \u201csilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u201d the court must defer to the Agency\u2019s interpretation so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d). \nThe plain meaning of section 7412(d)(4) does not support Petitioners\u2019 position \nthat a health threshold must already have been established prior to the rulemaking that promulgates health -based standards .  Petitioners\u2019 references t o case  law \ninterpreting statutes using the present perfect tense are inapposite.  Environmenta l Br. \n34-35.  Neither a statute criminalizing a convicted felon\u2019s receipt of a firearm which \n\u201chas been shipped or transported in interstate . . . commerce,\u201d nor a  statute requiring \na person seeking damages for wrongful imprisonment to show that a conviction \u201chas been reversed or set aside,\u201d contemplates an agency taking further regulatory action.  Indeed, there would be no logical framework for the identified actio ns under the \nstatutes at issue in those other cases to be performed if they had not already taken place, and therefore it would be illogical to read either of those statutes as being predicated on an action that had not yet happened.

The change from \u201c can be  established\u201d to \u201chas been  established\u201d  is most \nreasonably  read to clarify that it is not sufficient for the establishment of a health \nthreshold to be hypothetically possible.  Instead, section 7412(d) (4) provides that a \nhealth threshold must actually be established for EPA to set health -based standards.   \nHere, EPA \u2019s threshold determination  did just that.  \nFinally, EPA reasonably interpreted section 7412(d) as not requiring consensus \non or the resolution of all uncertainty regarding a pollutant\u2019s health effects before \ndetermining  that a health threshold \u201chas been established\u201d for that pollutant.

And nothing in the legislative \nhistory cited by Petitioners suggests otherwise .  The 1990 Senate report , see id. at 27, \nsimply indicates that health -based limits could be appropri ate \u201cwhere health \nthresholds are well -established . . . and the pollutant presents no risk of other adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, for which no threshold can be established.\u201d  S.

In short, EPA reasonably interprets section 74 12(d)(4) as authorizing it \nto determine that a health threshold has been established as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -based emission  standard, and to \nidentify a health threshold where not all scientific uncertainty has been resolved w ith \nrespect to carcinogenicity.

EPA reasonably found that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  were threshold pollutants  based on existing \nscientific evidence.  \nHere, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 argument, EPA applied its interpretation of \nsection 7412(d)(4) and reasonably found that a health threshold had \u201cbeen \nestablished\u201d for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride .  This finding, as USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 40 of 135\n-26- \n well as EPA\u2019s identi fication of a specific threshold value for each pollutant, is based \non a robust review of existing scientific literature, including consideration of toxicity \ndatabases that identify an exposure level below which adverse health effects are not expected to o ccur.  As part of its review of the health effects of hydrogen chloride , \nchlorine , and hydrogen fluoride , EPA stated that it considered each to be a threshold \npollutant based on a lack of affirmative carcinogenicity data and on the Agency\u2019s knowledge of ho w each pollutant reacts in the body and its likely mechanism of \naction.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41.    \n1. EPA appropriately considered information regarding \ncarcinogenic risk.  \nConsistent with its position that it may not promulgate he alth-based emission \nstandards for carcinogenic pollutants, EPA began its health threshold assessment by \nevaluating the evidence of  carcinogenicity of hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride .  In doing so , EPA considered reviews conducted by seve ral \nexisting authoritative bodies.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  None of those bodies had \nclassified hydrogen chloride , chlorine, or hydrogen fluoride  as carcinogens or \n\u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic,\u201d either individually or in combination.  \nId.  EPA found that there was an  absence of evidence of carcinogenic risk, and \ntherefore went on to consider whether a threshold  existed for each pollutant  below \nwhich other adverse health effects are not expected .

Reg. at 65,488/2.   It therefore \nwas reasonable for EPA to conclude , in light of other available evidence  discussed \nbelow,  that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  were threshold \npollutants.

Moreover, Petitioners have pointed to no evidence of ongoing \ndebate in the scientific community regarding the carcinogenicity of  hydrogen chloride , \nchlorine , or hydrogen fluoride.  \nFinally, Petitioners\u2019 concern that EPA\u2019s invocation of section 7412(d)(4) opens \nthe door for the Agency to issue health -based standards  for any HAP s with unknown  \ncancer risks or deliberately \u201c[stay] ignorant\u201d of the cancer risks of a pollutant , \nEnvironmental Br. 28, 30, is unfounded.

EPA also evaluates a host of other \nfactors, including non -cancer health effects, in determining whether a health threshold \nexists, and in further determining whether health -based emission limits are \nappropriate.

And because \nEPA\u2019s exercise of its section 7412( d)(4) authority is discretionary, EPA may decline to \npromulgate health -based standards even if it finds that a pollutant has an established \nhealth threshold.  \n2. EPA reasonably identified health thresholds for acid gases \nthat were equivalent to established human health values.  \nAfter discussing the available evidence on carcinogen icity, EPA then addressed  \nthe non-cancer health effects of chronic and acute exposure to  hydrogen chloride, \nchlorine, and hydrogen fluoride .  For each pollutant, EPA identified a human health \nvalue that is rooted in well -established, peer -reviewed toxicity databases.  S everal \nagencies \u2014including EPA\u2019s Integrated Risk Information System Program, the Agency \nof Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (A TSDR), and the California \nEnvironme ntal Protection Agency \u2014had conducted toxicity assessments of  one or \nmore of  the three pollutants.  80 Fed.

In other \nwords, for each pollutant, EPA based its conclusions on the highest-priority database for which an assessment was available.

EPA provided an a mple margin of s afety . \nOnce EPA determined that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  \nwere threshold pollutants, it prepared risk assessment s to determine a level of \nemissions that would ensure those health thresholds would not be exceeded, with an \nample marg in of safety, at any facility in the brick or clay source categor ies.

After identifying t he facility in each source category \nwith the highest modeled ambient chronic concentration\u2014i.e., the source whose \nemissions would generate exposure at the highest concentrations\u2014EPA then scaled up the emissions of that facility until the emission level would correspond to a non -\ncancer hazard quotient\n14 of one.  Id. \nFor brick facilities, that calculation generated an emission level of 250 tons per \nyear of hydrogen chloride -equivalent emissions, which is equivalent to 175 tons per \nyear of hydrogen fluoride  or 1.9 tons per year of chlorine .  Brick Risk Assessment at \n6, JA490.  Because an emission level of 250 tons per y ear of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent per brick facility  would result in exposures at or below the threshold level \nat the facility  with the greatest potential for human exposure , EPA concluded that an \nemission level of 250 tons per year of hydrogen chloride -equivale nt per brick facility \nwould be unlikely to result in adverse chronic health effects at any facility in the source category, and would result in exposure concentration levels remaining below \nthe chronic health reference v alues at all facilities.

For clay ceramics \nfacilities, the same approach led to an emission  level of 600 tons per year of hydrogen \n                                                 \n14 EPA exp resses health hazards by  dividing the chronic exposure level by the \nreference level.

While the acute screening \nindicated that the acute reference value for hydrogen fluoride (but not hydrogen \nchloride  or chlorine ) might be exceeded at some facilities, EPA was nevertheless able \nto conclude that there was low potential for acute health effects, as is further \ndiscussed infra at 43-45.

Reg. 38,044 (Sept. 14, \n1989), which is explicitly preserved in section 7412(f)(2)(B).

Environmental \nBr. 44.  This argument fails to acknowledge that the statute does not define how EPA \nmust include an ample margin of safety when setting health -based emission limits \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  Such a margin could be provided  at multiple points in \nthe process.  As Petitioners suggest, EPA could identify an exposure level that is \nbelow the established threshold level at which adverse health effects are not anticipated, and then run its modeling to determine  an emission  level that would \nresult in exposure concentrations at or below that lower health value.  But EPA may \nalso reasonably choose to base its emissions modeling on the established threshold, \nand build a sufficiently health -protective  model such that compliance with  the \nemission lim its should result in exposures below the established threshold level.  \nEither approach would  result in actual exposures that are below the threshold level, \nand either approach therefore provides an ample margin of safety.  EPA\u2019s use of the second approach here  was reasonable.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 7 5,642/3-43/ 1 (concluding \nthat \u201cit would be reasonable to set any [health -based] emission standard for a \npollutant with a health threshold at a level that at least assures that, for the sources in the controlled categ ory or subcategory, persons exposed to emissions of the pollutant \nwould not experience the adverse health effects on which the threshold is based\u201d). USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 55 of 135\n-41- \n 2. EPA\u2019s method of determining  emission levels based on \nidentified health threshold values provided an ample margin \nof safety.  \nOnce EPA identified health threshold values for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , \nand hydrogen fluoride  below which adverse effects were not expected to occur, it \nmodelled each value  to determine  an emission level  that would result in exposure at or \nbelow the threshold level.  Risk Assessments at 2, JA248, 486.   Importantly, however, \nEPA built several conservative assumptions into its model that it expected would \nresult in actual exposure levels remaining below the threshold level even if a facility emitted at the limit.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3.  This conservative modeling approach \nprovides the \u201cample margin of safety\u201d required by  section 7412(d)(4). \nFirst, EPA based the limits  \u201con the single facility in the source category with \nthe worst-case combination of meteorology and distance to nearest residential receptor that leads to the highest ambient concentrations.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3;  \nBrick Risk Assessment at 6, JA490; Clay Risk Assessment at 3, JA 249.  Because the  \nsame level of emissions at all other facilities will result in lower ambient concentrations, for all but one facility in each source category, the model understates \nthe quantity of emissions that would  be sufficient to cause exposures at the threshol d \nlevel.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3 (explainin g that chronic exposures at approximately \n90 percent of facilities are estimated to be half the threshold level or less).  \nAdditionally, EPA based the limit s on estimated ambient con centrations, which \nassume that people  at the exposure location at all times and do  not leave (to go to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 56 of 135\n-42- \n work or school, for i nstance ).  Id.   Because a  person is unlikely to breathe ambient air \naround the clock at an exposure  location, the model overestimates the average \nexposure to pollutants over time, and thus the risk of exposure at the threshold level, \nfor a person living at an exposure location.  \nThe ample margin of safety thus rests not on an assumption that sources\u2019 \nemissions will be lower than the permitted level, Environmental  Br. 46, but on the \nlikelihood that the conservative assumptions built into EPA\u2019s risk model ing approach \nwill mean that ambient chronic exposures for each facility remain below the threshold \nlevel even if the sources\u2019 emissions are at the maximum permitted level.  EPA \ntherefore reasonably concluded that this modeling approach, and the resultant emission levels that were determined , would ensure an ample margin of safety.   \nMoreover, as discussed su pra at 32-33, EPA\u2019s application of its own reference \nconcentration for hydrogen chloride  as the threshold level, rather than the different \nCalifornia EPA reference exposure level, was fully explained and reasonable, and \ntherefore does not undermine EPA\u2019s separate provision of an ample margin of safety through its modeling process .  Petitioners\u2019 argument that EPA\u2019s use of its own \nreference concentration negates the margin of safety provided by its modeling approach, Environmental Br. 46 -47, is therefore with out merit.

EPA\u2019s health -based standards provide an ample margin of \nsafety with respect to acute exposures.  \nPetitioners take issue  with EPA\u2019s assessment of acute exposure risk s for \nhydrogen fluoride , Environmental  Br. 41, but EPA properly assessed these risks . \nWhile EPA found that acute exposures at the selected emission limit  had the potential \nto be slightly above the California EPA acute reference exposure level for hydrogen \nfluoride at some  facilities (meaning that, at those facilities, the acute hazard quotient \nvalues had the potential to be greater than one), EPA nevertheless reasonably found \nthe potential for acute health effects at those facilities was low .  Brick Risk \nAssessment at 17, JA501; Clay Risk Assessment at 12, JA 258.  As  EPA  explained , \nexceeding the California EPA reference exposure level on which the acute hydrogen \nfluoride threshold was based does not automatically result in adverse health impacts.  \nBrick Risk Assessment at 13, JA497.  EPA considers a wider variety of reference \nvalues for its acute risk assessments than for its chronic risk assessments.  80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,503/2.

Id .  By \ncompa rison, EPA has found in section 7412(f) residual risk reviews that an emission \nstandard that would result in exposures with hazard quotients well above two  can still \nprovide an ample margin of safety.  See, e.g., NESHAP: Generic MACT Standards; and \nManufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins, 79 Fed. Reg. 60,898, 60,909 (Oct. 8, 2014)  \n(finding acute hazard quotient value of ten based on reference exposure level value for \nformaldehyde).  Furthermore, EPA\u2019s acute exposure scenario included a  conservative  \nassumption that a person would be present at the location of maximum exposure for \nthe single worst hour of the year in terms of emission levels and meteorological \nconditions.  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501.   \nFinally, EPA found that it was unlikely that a facility would emit only hydrogen \nfluoride and not other acid gases.18  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501; Clay Risk \nAssessment at 12, JA 258.  The brick emission limits allow facilities to emit either 250 \ntons per year of hydrogen chloride , or 175 tons per year of hydrogen fluoride , or 1.9 \n                                                 \n18 This finding is supported by the test data EPA used to set the emission limits.

EPA\u2019s acute exposure risk assessment for each \nparticular pollutant, however, assumed that a facility was emitting that  pollutant at the \nmaximum permitted level.  In reality, because all brick facilities emit a combination of acid gases and not just hydrogen fluoride, a facility would invariably exceed th e \nhydrogen chloride -equivalent emission limit based on emissions from a combination \nof acid gases before it reached the hydrogen fluoride limit.   See id.  Thus, u nder actual \nconditions, for a facility emitting 250 tons per year or less of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent, the hydrogen fluoride  emissions will be less than those predicted by the \nmodel .  Accordingly, EPA reasonably considered acute health risks when setting a \nhealth -based emission limit for hydrogen fluoride . \nIn short,  Petitioners have presented no basis to conclude that EPA acted \ncontrary to law in identifying health thresholds for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride , and setting emission limits for these pollutants under s ection \n7412(d)(4) . \nII.

While such standards also must ensure continuous regulation of the covered sources, id. \u00a7 7602(k), a s this Court has noted, \u201cno source emits any HAP  \nat a constant level; rather, HAP emission s fluctuate over time and for many reasons.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 598.

Petitioners challenge EP A\u2019s \napplication of the UPL methodology to limited datasets both in general, and specifically with respect to the emission limits it promulgated in the Brick/Clay Rule .  \nEnvironmental  Br. 49-53.  But EPA has provided ample support for its methodology . \nB. This Court has upheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a general matter.  \nEPA\u2019s use of the UPL was challenged  in two recent cases in this Circuit.  In \nNational Association of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (\u201cNACWA \u201d), which involved \nEPA\u2019s MACT standards for sewage sludge incinerators, this Court remanded certain aspects of the rule for further explanation, including the question of how the UPL \nrepresents the MACT floor for new and existing units.  734 F.3d 1115, 1143  (D.C. \nCir. 2013).  The NACWA  Court did not invalidate the use of the UPL, but rather \nheld that EPA needed to more fully explain why the UPL was appropriate.  Id. at \n1151.  See also U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633.   \nEPA then provided such explanation in its re sponse to a remand of the record \nin challenges to rules for boilers and commercial and industrial solid waste \nincineration units.  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633-34.  In that case, the Court found that \nEPA had \u201cdemonstrate[d] with substantial evidence . . . that the UPL \u2018allows a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 63 of 135\n-49- \n reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units, \u2019\u201d which \nrepresented \u201creasoned decision making\u201d and accordingly was entitled to deference.  \nId. at 636.  The Court concluded that \u201cthe UPL \u2018reflect[s] a reasona ble estimate of the \nemission s achieved in practice by the best- performing sources,\u2019\u201d and upheld EPA\u2019s \ngeneral use of the methodology.  Id. at 639 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 871-72).  \nC. EPA adequately justified the a pplication of the UPL m ethodology \nto limited datasets.  \nThe Court\u2019s opinion in U.S. Sugar  expressly left open the question of whether \nthe UPL is an appropriate statistical method for small datasets.  830 F.3d at 633  n.25.  \nEPA addressed that issue in this Rule in a pair of memoranda setting f orth its general \napproach for applying the UPL to limited datasets, and explaining how that approach was followed in determining  the brick and clay MACT floors.  See Approach for \nApplying the Upper Prediction Limit to Limited Datasets (Sept. 24, 2015), EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2013 -0291- 0661 (\u201cBrick Limited Datasets Memo\u201d) and EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290-0295 (\u201cClay Limited Datasets Memo\u201d)  JA857, 370.   \nAs EPA explained, d etermining the distribution of data is an important \ncomponent of the UPL approa ch, and EPA uses well-established tests of kurtosis and \nskewness\n20 to determine distribution .  Limited Datasets Memos at 1 -2, JA 370-371, \n                                                 \n20 The kurtosis statistic cha racterizes the degree of peakedness or flatness of a given \ndata distribution in comparison to a normal distribution.  The skewness statistic \ncharacterizes the degree of asymmetry of a given data distributio n.  Brick MACT \nFloor Memo at 3 -4, JA 817-818.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 64 of 135\n-50- \n 857-858.  Previously, EPA  used a kurtosis equation that required at least four values \nin a dataset.  Id.   In further reviewing the applic ation of th e UPL to limited datasets, \nhowever, EPA identified another kurtosis estimating equation that provides a \nmeaningful result with as few as three values.  Id .  This equation enables EPA to apply \nthe UPL to smaller datasets. \nAs EPA further explained , to determine sample size thresholds above which \nuse of the UPL does not require further scrutiny, or  below which use of the UPL is \nnot appropriate, EPA considers how a diminishing sample size affects the t-score, \nwhich is \u201ca value that estimates the unce rtainty and variability for a certain confidence \nlevel associated with a specific number of data points.\u201d  Brick Limited Datasets Memo \nat 2, JA858.  As the sample size decreases, t he t-score \u2014and the uncerta inty of the \naverage that is calculated from the av ailable data points \u2014increases.  Id.  As the sample \nsize increases, the relative changes in the t-score become less dramatic, particularly \nonce the sample size is equal to or greater than three .  Id. at 3 (Figure  1, Table 1), 5, \nJA859, 861 .  EPA thus determined that it may be appropriate to use the  UPL to \ndevelop emission limits based on as few as  three datapoints.21  Id. at 2, JA858. \nEven with the use of the alternate kurtosis equation, EPA \u201crecognize[d] that \nthe use of the UPL approach for limited dat asets introduces some amount of \n                                                 \n21 Additionally, because emission tests typicall y include three test runs, the MACT \nfloor dataset size is typically a multiple of three.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 5, \nJA861. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 65 of 135\n-51- \n uncertainty in the calculation of MACT standar ds.\u201d  Limited Dataset s Memos at 2 , \nJA371, 858 .  Accordingly, EPA  identified addition al steps \u201cto ensure that the level of \nthe MACT standards is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  For MACT floors  based on between three  \nand six test runs, EPA conducts additional, case -by-case evaluation \u201cto ensure that the \nuncertainty associated with a limited dataset does not cause the calculated emission \nlimit to be so high that it does not reflect the average pe rformance of the units upon \nwhich the limit is based after accounting for variability the emissions of those units.\u201d  \nSee id. at 6-8, JA375-377, 862- 864.  That evaluation include s some combination of \n\u201cconfirming that the data distribution was selected correctly; after confirming the data distribution, ensuring that we use the most appropriate UPL equation; and, as necessary, comparing UPL equation components for the individual unit  upon which a \nnew source floor is based with those of the units in the existing source floor to determine if our identification of the best unit is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  EPA thus \nreasonably explained why MACT floors derived from limited datasets can be consid ered adequate, and identified a sufficient case -by-case evaluation process to \nensure that individual MACT floors based on limited datasets are reasonable.   \nPetitioners\u2019 contention  that NACWA precludes the application of the UPL to \nlimited datasets, Enviro nmental Br. 49,  is incorrect.  The NACWA  Court simply \ndirected EPA to explain \u201cwhy the [UPL] could still be considered accurate given a small dataset,\u201d 734 F. 3d at 1144- 45.  EPA in this rule has done exactly what the \nNACWA Court directed , and what the U.S. Sugar  Court found EPA  had successfully USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 66 of 135\n-52- \n done on a more general level:  EPA demonstrated that the UPL can, when applied to \nlimited datasets, still allow a reasonable inference as to the emissions achieved by the \nbest-performing sources , and EPA has adopted a sound analytical process to follow \nwhen it uses the UPL to  determine  a MACT floor and based on limited data.  \nEPA \u201c\u2018typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of data -gathering \nnecessary to solve a problem,\u2019\u201d and is entit led to  deference \u201cwhen it determines how \nbest to meet the technical challenges in its area of expertise.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131).  Here, EPA\u2019s analysis of  the acceptable \nlevel of uncertainty in the determination  of M ACT floors, and its development of a \nprocess to further evaluate and address that uncertainty, are  reasonable .  See \nNACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville, 370 F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club v. EPA, 167 \nF.3d 658, 661-63 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (stating that the CAA doe s not specify how EPA \nmust determine what the best-performing units are achieving, and EPA has \nconsiderable discretion in doing so as long as its methodology is reasonable).     \nD. EPA adequately supported its use of the UPL in the Brick/ Clay \nRule. \nThe Limite d Datasets Memos apply EPA\u2019s evaluative process to brick and clay \nMACT floors involving  limited datasets.  See Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, \nJA864-866; Clay Limited Datasets Memo at 8, JA377 .  EPA had limited datasets for \n18 pollutants and subcatego ries in the brick source category, and for 21 pollutants and \nsubcategories in the clay cera mics source category .  Brick Limited Datasets Memo at USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 67 of 135\n-53- \n 11 (Table 4), JA867; Clay Limited Datasets Memo  at 9 (Table  2), JA378.  For e ach \ndataset, EPA explained that it \u201censur[ed] that [it] selected the data distribution that \nbest re presents each dataset;\u201d \u201censur[ ed] that the correct equation for the distribution \nwas then applied to the data;\u201d and \u201ccompar[ed] individual components of each limited \ndataset to determine if the standards based on limited datasets reasonably represent \nthe performance of the units included in the dataset.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 8 , \nJA377, 864 .  EPA determi ned based on its evaluation that no changes to its usual  \nfloor calculation procedure w ere warranted for the clay MACT floors, and that \nchanges were warranted for five of the brick floors.  Id . \nEnvironmental Petitioners contend that EPA did not adequately explain the \nadjustments made  to five brick floor calculations .  Environmental Br. 52.  They \nfurther assert that EPA improperly made upward adjustments to two of the five \nfloors.  Id.  Both of these arguments fail.  First, for each of the five adjusted MACT \nfloors, the Limited Datasets Memo includes an explanation of how and why EPA made these adjustments.  Se e Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, JA 864-866.   \nFor the new source MACT floor for PM (in pounds per ton) from large tunnel \nkilns, EPA found that it could not accurately determine a representative distribution from the best-performing source because there were only two test runs for that kiln, \nso EPA selected the next best-performing unit and recalculated the UPL based on that unit.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 8, JA864.  For the existing  source MACT \nfloor for PM (in grams per dry square cubic foot) from small tunnel kilns, EPA found USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 68 of 135\n-54- \n that the distribution of the dataset would be better represented by a lognormal \ntemplate , and determined  the MACT floor using that template .  Id. at 8-9, JA864-865.   \nSee also  UPL Memo at 7 -9, JA 509-511 (describing characteristics of normal and \nlognormal distribution curves).   Similarly, for the new source MACT floors for \nmercury (in pounds per ton, micrograms per dry standard cubic meter, and pounds \nper hour), EPA explained that the datasets would be better represented by a \nlognormal distribution and template.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 9-10, JA 865-\n866.  EPA therefore adequately explained the basis for the adjustments. \nFurthermore, EPA reasonably adjusted u pward the floors (in pounds per ton \nand pounds per hour) for mercury emissions from large new kilns.  In arguing that \nEPA\u2019s decision to adjust those floors was arbitrary, Environmental  Br. 52-53, \nPetitioners first fail to note that EPA also made changes to  the mercury floors outside \nthe limited dataset analysis.  As discussed infra  at 75-76 , EPA added a variability factor \nto account for variations in the mercury content of raw material used at brick kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2-3 .  Because the addition of a raw material variability factor \u2014\nwhich Environmental Petitioners do not challenge \u2014introduces more uncertainty into \nthe UPL calculations, it results  in a higher MACT floor.   See Brick MACT Floor \nMemo  at 8-9, JA822-823.  See also  Cover Sheet, \u201cCalculation of Upper Prediction \nLimit before and after addition of mercury variability factor\u201d (summarizing EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2013 -0291 -0660 , Appendices B -1, B2), JA 925-926.  Therefore, the upward \nadjustment of the mercury floors was due at least in  part to the uncontested USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 69 of 135\n-55- \n application of a raw material variability factor .  In any event, w hile the steps outlined \nin the Limited Datasets Memos aim to ensure  that a MACT floor determined  by \napplying the UPL methodology to a limited dataset is not unreason ably high, see Brick \nLimited Dataset s Memo at 6, JA 862, the  specific facts in the record of a given rule \nmay lead to an adjustment either downward or upward to ensure the floor more \naccurately represents the average of the best -performing source or sources .   \nIn short, EPA articulated a reasonable method for ensuring that MACT floors \nbased on limited datasets \u201creflect the average performance of the units upon which \nthe limit is based.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 6 , JA375, 862.  EPA then applied that \nmethod in the case of the brick and clay MACT floors  based on limited datasets.  \nEPA demonstrated that its application of the UPL methodology to limited datasets is reasonable both in general and as applied to the Brick/Clay Rule .  EPA has therefore \nmet the requirement identified in NACWA and U.S. Sugar  that it \u201cdemonstrate [s] \nwith substantial evidence\u2014not mere assertions\u2014that the UPL allows a reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131) (internal quotation marks omitted ).   \nIII. EPA\u2019s use of a lternative emission limits for b rick tunnel kilns was \nreasonable. \nIn the Brick Rule, rather than promulgating a single numeric MACT limit for \neach subcateg ory, EPA gave operators of new and existing tunnel kilns a choice of \nthree alternative emission limits, each expressed in a different unit of measurement, USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 70 of 135\n-56- \n for both mercury and non-mercury metals.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474.   To comply with \nthe mercury emissio n limits , sources could choose one of three  numeric emission \nlimits expressed as mass of pollutant emitted per ton of bricks produced, pounds per \nhour, or concentration (micrograms per dry standard cubic meter).  Id.  at 65,530, \nTable 1.  For non-mercury metals, EPA set a pounds per hour emission limit, and also \nprovided options for limiting PM as a surrogate22 with limits in pounds per ton or \ngrains per dry standard cubic foot.  Id .  This approach \u201c provides  flexibility for the \nregulated c ommunity by allowing a regulated source to choose any control technology \nor technique to meet the emission limits, rather than requiring each unit to use a \nprescribed control method that may not be appropriate in each case.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,633/2.    \nConsistent with the statutory directive to determine  MACT floors based on the \n\u201cbest performing\u201d sources \u201cfor which [ EPA ] has emissions information,\u201d  EPA \ndetermined  the MACT floor for each of the alternative limits using a slightly different \npool of sources .  EPA found  that the composition of the group of top -ranked sources \nvaried depending on the unit of measurement that was appl ied.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/2.  EPA therefore ranked sources  so th at \u201c[e]ach floor [would be] based on \nthe best performing units for that unit of measurement.\u201d  Id .  In other words, as EPA \n                                                 \n22 The use of PM as a surrogate for HAP metals in the context of setting MACT \nfloors  is well -established and not at issue here.  Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 982 \n(quoting Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v. EPA , 233 F.3d 625, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 71 of 135\n-57- \n explained, \u201cthe concentration floor is based on the ranking of concentration data, and \nthe [pounds -per-hour]  floor is based on the ranking of the [pounds -per-hour]  data.\u201d  \nId.   \nEPA\u2019s decision to set alternative emission limits for mercury and non -mercury \nmetals for brick tunnel kilns is consistent with the statutory language.  Section 7412(d) \ndirects EPA to promulgate \u201c[e]missions standards . . . [that] require the maximum degree  of reduction in emissions,\u201d and requires those standards to be based on the \nbest-performing source or sources for which the Administrator has emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  Nothing in the plain language of the \nstatute forecloses the promulgation of multiple, alternative standards that each independently meets  those requirements.  \nMoreover, the statute does not specify what unit of measurement EPA must \nuse in expressing  its emission  limitations or identifying the best- performing source or \nsources to determine  the MACT floor.   Congress therefore left to EPA\u2019s discretion \nthe selection of an appropriate metric by which to measure sources\u2019 performance.  Inherent in that discretion is the abi lity to set alternative floors based on differ ent \nmetrics.\n23  EPA has considerable discretion in its determination  of MACT floors as \nlong as its methodology is reasonable.  NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville; 370 \n                                                 \n23 EPA has promulgated alternative emission limits pursuant to section 7412(d) in \nseveral other rules.  See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, Subpt. UUU \u00a7 63.1564(a)(1) (setting \nalternative limitations for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units at \npetroleum refineries); Subpt. DDDDD \u00a7 63.7500(a), Tables 1 and 2 (major boilers).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 72 of 135\n-58- \n F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 661- 63.  EPA\u2019s decision to promulgate \nalternativ e limits is therefore reviewable under Chevron  step two, and is entitled to \ndeference so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d  \nChevron , 467 U.S. at 842 -43. \nPetitioners argue that because the alternative floors were not based on identical \nemission levels, they are not equal, and that two of the floors are therefore less stringent.  Environmental Br. 54.  Petitioners further claim that it is impossible for \nmultiple sources or groups of sources to all be the \u201cbest\u201d performing sou rce or group \nof sources unless their emission levels are identical.  Id.  This argument is rooted in an \noverly simplistic conception of when emission limits may be said to be based on the \u201cbest\u201d performing source s.  The alternative floors each reflect the \u201cbest\u201d performing \nsource s because each is based on the best-performing sources for the unit of \nmeasurement for that floor.    \nSimilarly, Petitioners\u2019 contention that the use of alternative floors allows \nregulated facilities to choose the least stringent floor with which to comply, see Environmental  Br. 53, mistakenly assumes that one of the alternative floors is the \nmost or least stringent.  Instead, the relative stringency of the alternative floors is an \napples -to-oranges comparison.  By way of analogy, in a comparison of the most \ntalented professional football, basketball, and baseball players, it would be impossible  \nto determin e which is the best-performing  athlete without establishing  a metric for \nevaluating overall athletic performance.  Furthermore, it is impossible to say that the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 73 of 135\n-59- \n football player who scores the most touchdowns is a better or worse -performing  \nathlete than the  basketball player who makes  the most three -point shots, or than the \nbaseball player who hits  the most home runs, because those metrics are not directly \ncomparable.   Given this, it would be reasonable to set a standard for athleticism that \nrequires an athl ete to have either scored at least a certain number of touchdowns, \nmake  at least a certain number of three -point shots, or hit at least a certain number of \nhome runs.  That athletes could  pick the metric that they are most capable of meeting \nwould  not make  the approach unreasonable.  \nThe same is true when measuring the performance of brick kilns.  For instance, \na smaller facility with fewer kilns may emit a smaller volume of pollutants overall as \nmeasured in pounds per hour, but it may emit more pollutants p er ton of bricks \nproduced.  By contrast, a larger kiln may emit more pollutants as measured in pounds per hour, but may run more efficiently and therefore have lower emissions as \nmeasured in pounds per ton of bricks produced.  See, e.g. , Brick MACT Floor M emo \nat A-2 (Table A-1), A-5 (Table A-2), A-9 (Table A-5), JA830, 833, 837 (showing Kiln \n514 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per ton of PM, Kiln 508 as \nthe top -ranking large kiln as measured by grams of PM per dry square cubic foot, and \nKiln 526 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per hour of non-\nmercury metal HAP).     \nEPA\u2019s decision to set al ternative emission  limitations for brick tunnel kilns was \ntherefore a reasonable exercise of it s discretion under section 7412(d ).  Having USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 74 of 135\n-60- \n decided  to promulgate alternative limits, EPA\u2019s method for calculating those limits \nwas also reasonable.  EPA explained this method and its rationale for calculating each \nMACT floor based on its own unit of measure dataset.  S ee 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2, \n65,507/1.  In  basing each alterna tive limit on the best- performing sources for that \nunit of measurement, EPA satisfied the requirement of section 7412(d)(3 ) to base its \nMACT floors on the best -performing sou rces in a category.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  \nFinally, Petitioners suggest that it was unnecessary for EPA to promulgate \nalternative limits because EPA could have divid ed tunnel kilns into further \nsubcategories (i.e., beyond two subcategories based on size), and then set a single \nemission  limit for each subcategory .  Environmental Br. 55.  While EPA has the \ndiscretion to  further subcategoriz e and considered whether to d o so, see 79 Fed. Reg. \nat 75,634/1, the discretion to identify subcategories does not foreclose the Agency\u2019s \nauthority  to promulgate alternative emission  limits  where appropriate .  \nIV. EPA reasonably considered emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determining major source MACT floors.  \nSynthetic area sources (or \u201csynthetic minor sources\u201d) are sources that have the \npotential to emit HAPs in excess of the major  source threshold, but whose emissions \nhave been controlled to the extent that they fall below  the threshold due to federally -\nenforceable emission  controls.  See Brick Rule Summary of Public Comments and \nResponses at 46 -47 (Sept. 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0685 (\u201cBrick Rule \nRTC\u201d) , JA907-908; 2003 Rule, 68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2.  Consistent with EPA\u2019s USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 75 of 135\n-61- \n interpretation of section 7412, EPA treats such sources as area  sources for \ndeterm ining applicability of emission  standards, but as major sources for other \npurposes.  Because the statute directs EPA to identify the level of control achieved in \npractice by the best-performing  sources, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3), EPA consid ers \nemissions information from synthetic area sources when determining  which sources \nare the best-performing  sources.  EPA continued to use this approach in setting the \nbrick industry standards.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A-6, A-9, A -10 to A -12 \n(Tabl es A-1, A-2, A -5, A-7, A -8, A -9), JA830 -834, 837, 838-840. \nBIA challenges EPA\u2019s inclusion of emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determin ing existing source MACT floors for the PM and mercury \nstandards for large kilns.  Industry Br. 20.  Because BIA did not challenge this  same \napproach to determining MACT floors in the 2003 Rule, see  68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2 -\n98/3, its argument is time-barred.  Med . Waste Inst.  v. EPA, 645 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. \nCir. 2011)  (holding that a challenge to EPA\u2019s approach not raised within sixty days of \nEPA\u2019s first use of the approach was barred).  The argument also fails because EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the ambiguous statutory text is reasonable and consistent with the statute\u2019s structure, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA policy.   \nA. Syntheti c area sources do not fit neatly within the s ection 74 12(a) \ndefinition of either a major s ource or an area s ource . \nSection 7412(a) of the CAA defines a \u201cmajor source\u201d based on a thresh old \namount of HAPs that a source \u201cemits or has the potential to emit considering USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 76 of 135\n-62- \n controls.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1).  A source with the potential to emit at or above the \nthreshold is a major source, and any other source is an area source.  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) , \n(a)(2).  Major sources are treated differently from area sources in certain respects.  See, \ne.g., id. \u00a7 7412(c) (requiring EPA to list all categories of major sources, but only \nrequiring EPA to list area sources in certain circumstances); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(5) (allowing \nEPA to set standards for area sources based on \u201cgenerally available control technologies or management practices\u201d rather than the MACT floor). \nDetermining whether a source should be considered as a major source or an \narea source is not always straightforward.  The definition of a major source includes the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering controls .\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  This phrase is not defined in the statute, and its meaning is ambiguous.  Although this phrase would not matter for determining whether most sources are major sources, it does matter for synthetic area sources.  EPA interprets the phrase to \nshow that consideration of a source\u2019s potential to emit before and after controls is relevant to how the source is treated (in both setting and applying standards).  See 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,509 /1-2.  This interpretation is entitled to considerable deference, as it \nis a permissible construction of a complex statute that is within the agency\u2019s area of expertise.  See Chevr on, 467 U.S. at 842- 43; United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218, \n227-31 (2001).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 77 of 135\n-63- \n B. EPA\u2019s consideration of synthetic area source data is consistent \nwith the CAA and longstanding EPA policy.  \n Section 7412 expresses Congress\u2019s intent that emission standards fo r existing \nmajor sources are based on levels that are actually achieved by the \u201cbest performing\u201d \nexisting sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A) (basing  standards on the \u201cbest \nperforming 12 percent of the existing sources\u201d); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B) (basing  standards \non the \u201cbest performing 5 sources\u201d).  Consistent with this intent, EPA includes \nemission s information from synthetic area sources when determin ing the MACT floor \nfor existing major sources.  Synthetic area sources demonstrate \u201cemission limitation [s] \nachieved\u201d by major sources because their controls have effectively reduced their \nemissions  from above major source threshold levels to below major source threshold \nlevels .  It would be contrary to congressional intent to exclude synthetic area sources \nfrom the MACT floor determination simply because their controls decreased their \nemissions enough to fall below the major  source threshold level.  This approach is \nalso consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history.  See Floor Statement of Sen. \nDurenber ger, 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 870 (clarifying  the intent that EPA collect \u201cdata \non all of the better -performing sources within each category\u201d and ensure that EPA \n\u201cdoes not miss any sources that have superior levels of emission s control\u201d ).  EPA\u2019s \ninclusion of synthetic area sources for p urposes of determining the MACT floor \nensures \u201csources that have superior levels of  emission s control \u201d are considered. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 78 of 135\n-64- \n Further, section 7412(d)(3) expressly exclude s from the MACT floor \ncalculation  those sources that meet the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nof section 7501 .  See 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A), 7501(3).  The express exclusion of \nthose  sources demonstrates that Congress considered the issue of which sources \nshould be excluded from the MACT floor determination , but did not conclude that \nsynthetic area sources should be excluded .  Instead, Congress provided EPA the \nflexibility to include synthetic area sources.  \nEPA has consistently treated synthetic area sources as area sources when \ndetermining the applicability of particular requirements, but as major sources for \ndetermin ing major source MACT floors.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.2 (defining \u201cpotential to \nemit\u201d as the \u201cmaximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its \nphysical and operational design,\u201d and a limitation on the capacity of the source \u201cshall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on \nemissions is federally enforceable\u201d \u2014i.e. , a synthetic area source would not be subject \nto major source stan dards); Memorandum from John S. Seitz to EPA Regions, \nPotential to Emit for MACT Standards \u2013  Guidance on Timing Issues (May 16, 1995) , \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0569  (\u201cSeitz Memo\u201d), JA 441-450 (addressing  when a \nmajor source can become a synthetic area source).  And EPA has included synthetic \narea sources in MACT floor calculations in prior rulemakings.  E.g., NESHAP for \nMunicipal Solid Waste Landfills , 68 Fed. Reg. 2227, 2 232/2 (Jan. 16, 2003); NESHAP USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 79 of 135\n-65- \n for Polyvinyl Chloride and Copolymers  Production , 77 Fed. Reg. 22,848, 22,876/3-\n78/1 (Apr. 17, 2012) . \nC. The CAA allows EPA to treat synthetic area sources as major or \narea sources depending on context.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires exclusion of synthetic area \nsources wrongly assumes that synthetic area sources can never be considered major \nsources for any purpose.  BIA argues that EPA may only use sources \u201cin the \ncategory\u201d to determine the MACT floor for that category , thus excluding synthetic \narea source data from consideration , since they are n ot subject to major source \nstandards .  Industry Br. 19-20 .  BIA\u2019s argument is based on the assumption that a \nsource must be treated as either a major or an area source for every purpose .  As \nexplained above, that is not how EPA interprets the statutory def inition of \u201cmajor \nsource\u201d in the context of  synthetic area sources.   \nContrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, EPA does not \u201cadmit[  ] that synthetic [area] \nsources are not major sources.\u201d  Industry Br. 21.24  EPA has stated that although \nsynthetic area sources \u201care not subject to the requirements imposed on major sources \n. . . that does not equate to a conclusion that they are no longer major sources in any respect.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  EPA considers synthetic area sources to be major \n                                                 \n24 That the standards\u2019 appl ication is \u201climited to brick plants located at a major source ,\u201d \nIndustry Br. 20,  demonstrates only that EPA does not subject synthetic area sources \nto major source standards , which is consistent with EPA\u2019s position.  See 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 63.8385.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 80 of 135\n-66- \n sources in certain respects, such as when EPA identifies the best -performing major \nsources as part of the MACT floor determination.  Id.   Thus, eve n if, as BIA \ncontends, section 74 12(d)(3)(A) requires that all sources considered in determining the \nMACT floor be \u201cin the category,\u201d see Industry Br. 21, synthetic area sources are  major \nsources that are \u201cin the category\u201d for the purpose of determining the MACT floor.  \nFurther, this does not mean that section 74 12(d)(3)(A)\u2019s phrase  \u201cin the category  or \nsubcategory \u201d is meaningless.  The phra se limits the sources that EPA considers.  Here, \nfor example, when setting standards for brick sources, EPA only look ed at the \nemission limitations achieved by brick sources\u2014not the emission limitations achieved \nby tile sources or other non-brick sources.  The phrase also means that brick sources \nthat are true area sources are excluded from major source MACT floor \ndeterminations.  \nNowhere does the statute require that once a source is treated as \u201cin\u201d (or out \nof) a category , it must be treated that way for all purposes.  BIA\u2019s argument that \nCongress excluded sources meeting the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nfrom section 7412(d)(3) because they are \u201cin\u201d the major source category while synthetic area sources are excluded by definition because they are not \u201cin\u201d the major source category only continues to rely on BIA\u2019s preferred interpretation of the statute.  See Industry Br. 22.  EPA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering \ncontrols\u201d  is consistent with Congress\u2019s direction to use the \u201cbest performing\u201d sources \nin the category or subcategory and is entitled to deference.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 81 of 135\n-67- \n Further, this Court has acknowledged that synthetic area sources should not \nnecessarily be treated the same as area sources.  See U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at  650 \n(finding that EPA had not adequately explained \u201cwhy the rationale it used to exempt \nnatural area sources from Title V could be identically applied to synthetic area  \nsources.\u201d).  And for a major source included in more tha n one source category, if the \nsource\u2019s compliance with major  source standards for one source category results in \nthe source\u2019s potential to emit falling below the major  source threshold, EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation allows the source to be treated as a synthetic ar ea source for later-\npromulgated standards for a different source category .  See Seitz Memo at 9-10, \nJA449-450.   This Court should therefore defer to EPA\u2019s reasonable and longstanding \ntreatment of synthetic area sources as major sources for the purpose of determin ing \nthe MACT floor.  \nV. The PM standards are consistent with the statute and rationally \ndeveloped, and EPA adequately responded to BIA\u2019s comments.  \nA. EPA reasonably determined the MACT floor s using the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for which it ha d emissions \ninformation. \nFor a category with 30 or more sources, section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires EPA to \ndetermine  the existing  source MACT floor by calculating  the \u201caverage emission \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sourc es (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 82 of 135\n-68- \n This is precisely what EPA did in determining the MACT floor for PM from existing \nbrick sources.  \nEPA  initially identified two potential approaches for determining the existing \nsource MACT floor for PM emissions from brick sources, and sought information from the brick industry to use in determin ing MACT floors.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,635/1-2, 75,649/1- 2.  The first p roposed approach was based on the possibility \nthat EPA could identify the best- performing 12 percent of sources in the entire \ncategory, in which case the MACT floors could be based on a larger number of \nsources.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,506/3; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1- 2.  At the time of the \nproposal, EPA assumed that kilns with fabric filters would be the best-performing sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1; Analysis of Potential Subcategories for BSCP \nTunnel Kilns at 6 -7 (Nov. 6, 2014)  EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0122 , JA530-531.  \nEPA explained that if  kilns with fabric filters were the best-performing sources and if  \nit had information from all fabric filter -controlled sources, then EPA could identify \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1-2; 80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,506/ 2-3.  Because the category contained 225 sources at the time of \nproposal and 220 when the standards were issued, the best-performing 12 percent of the category would be represented by 27 sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 7 5,635/2 ; Brick \nMACT Floor Memo at 10 (Table  1), JA 824 (showing 122 large kilns and 98 small \nkilns).  EPA expressed concern, however, that although kilns with fabric filters were statistically better -performing as a group, emissions data reflected that some  sources USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 83 of 135\n-69- \n with other or no controls performed better  than some of the fabric filter -controlled \nkilns.  7 9 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1 -2.  EPA therefore requested information on the \nreliability of data showing low emissions from kilns without fabric filters.  Id. \nThe second proposed approach was simply to set  emission limits \u201cbased on the \ntop 12 percent of the data available in each of the kiln size sub categories.\u201d  Id. at \n75,635 n.1; see id. at 75,649/1-2; Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) \nFloor Analysi s for Brick and Structural Clay Products at 11-12, A -5 to A -8 (T ables  A-\n4, A-5) (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0291 -0119 (\u201cProposed Brick MACT \nFloor Memo\u201d ), JA522-523, 525-528.25  EPA proposed  emission  limits under this \napproach, Proposed Brick MACT Floor Memo at 12  (Tables 5, 6), JA523, and  \nrequested comment on  the method of generating th ose limits , and on whether the \navailable-data approach should be used instead of the fabric filter -based approach.  79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,649/2.  EPA noted that the reliabili ty of the data from non-fabric \n                                                 \n25 To determine  MACT floors based on the total number of sources in the category \n(with 30 or more sources), EPA would need sufficient information about all sources \nin the category to conclude that it had emissions data from the best-performing 12 \npercent of sources.  For  example, if a category has 100 sources, EPA could base the \nMACT floors on 12 sources only if it has information to show that those 12 sources are the best performers in the category.  Alternatively, EPA could determine the floor \nbased on 12 percent of the  sources for which it has emissions information.  For \nexample, if EPA has information for only 50 of 100 sources, the MACT floor could be calculated based on the best- performing 6 sources for which EPA has data, even \nthough some of the sources fo r which EP A does not have data  might be better -\nperforming sources.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 84 of 135\n-70- \n filter-controlled  kilns was \u201ca key factor\u201d in determining which approach is \nappropriate.  Id.  at 75,635 n.1.  \nBetween the proposal and the final rule,  EPA did not receive information \nsufficient to exp lain why some non-fabric filter -controlled sources emitted at levels as \nlow as or lower than some sources with fabric filter controls .  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/1.  EPA therefore had no basis for excluding data from those lower -emitting \nnon-fabric filter -controlled sources and thus c ould no longer assume that fabric filter -\ncontrolled sources were the best performers.  Additionally, EPA d id not have \nemissions data from all the fabric filter -controlled sources, so even if it could have \nexcluded the lower emitting data, it would not nece ssarily have had information from \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources in the category .  Id. at 65,484 /3-85/1.  For \nthese reasons, EPA determined  the final PM MACT floors using the best -performing \n12 percent of sources for which it had emissions information.   Id. at 65,485/1-2 .  EPA \nfinalized the standards using subcategories based on kiln size, consistent with the \nsecond  approach it had proposed.  Id.   Because the data showed that some non -fabric \nfilter kilns had lower emissions th an fabric filter -controlled kilns, EPA reasonably \nconcluded that it could not assume that fabric filter -controlled kilns were the best-\nperforming kilns, and EPA appropriately set the PM MACT floors based on the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for whi ch it had emissions information.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 85 of 135\n-71- \n B. The PM MACT standard reasonably represents the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources.  \nBIA\u2019s contention that the PM MACT floors are unrepresentative because the \ndata were skewed toward the best-performing sources, Industry  Br. 24-28, is not \nsupported by the record .  See White Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1247 (considering similar \nallegations, and finding that  \u201casser tions of a biased or irrational data collection \nprocess are not  supported by a review of the record \u201d).  EPA relied on  data from a \nvariety of sources, including responses to EPA surveys, test data compiled during the \n2003 rulemaking, and additional data from Petitioner BIA.

And BIA could have provided emissions data \nfrom more sources.  Although data from fabric filter -controlled sources were a large \nportion of EPA\u2019s dataset, these sources were not consistently the best performers.  \nIndee d, EPA included data from non -fabric filter -controlled sources to determin e the \nMACT floors.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A -9, JA 830-837, (showing non-\nfabric filter -controlled sources ranked in the top twelve percent).  And like the data at \nissue in Wh ite Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1248, here, some of the best-performing sources for \nPM were worse -performing for mercury.  Compare  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 \nto A-6, JA 830-834 with id. at A-10 to A -12, JA838-840.  \nEPA has provided ample support and justificatio n for its  method , and had no \nreason to believe that the lower non -fabric filter emissions data were inaccurate.  See USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 86 of 135\n-72- \n 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,484/3 -85/1 ; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635 /1-2, 75,649/1-2 .  EPA \nproceeded cautiously in questioning the data that were  counter to its expectations and \nrequesting comment, and the  industry responses did not show that the data were \nunreliable.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,48 4/3-8 5/1.  Moreover, contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion \nthat \u201c EPA made no attempt to reconcile the suspicious data ,\u201d Industry Br. 25, EPA \ncontacted kiln owners to request information concerning the test results, requested \ninput from BIA, and undertook a technical review of the data.  See, e.g., Telephone \nContact Summary for Lee Brick (May 2015) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0650 , JA781; \nTelephone Contact Summary for Boral Industries (May 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0291- 0649, JA780; Email from Sharon Nizich to Terry Schimmel and Susan Miller, \nRe: More Information Needed on Kiln Test Reports for Uncontrolled Kilns at 4 -6 \n(June 8, 2015 at 10:42 am), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0607, JA785-787; Brick Test \nData Memo at 6 , JA814.  Therefore, EPA reasonably relied on these  data in \ndetermin ing the PM MACT floors.  \nC. EPA complied with procedural requirements.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that EPA failed to respond to information it provided  \nconcerning  lower emissions data  for some non-fabric filter -controlled sources, \nIndustry Br. 28-29 , lacks merit .  EPA is only required to respond to significant \ncomments.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(6)(B); Covad Commc\u2019ns Co. v. FCC, 450 F.3d 528, 550 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) .  Here, the sole \u201ccomment\u201d that BIA cites is an email providing  a list \nof kilns with short notes on factors BIA suspected might affect the test data, without USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 87 of 135\n-73- \n explaining why the factors might cause the data to be unrepresentative of the kiln\u2019s \nemissions.  See Email from Susan Miller to Sharon Nizich, DLA/Uncontrolled Kilns \n(June 25, 2015 at 2:43 pm ), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0614, JA788 (listing notes  \nsuch as \u201c[i]nitial MACT compliance test- suspect all new limestone\u201d).  This  can hardly \nbe considered a legally significant comment.  Indeed, BIA\u2019s explanation of these \nfactors in its b rief provides more explanation than was provided  in its email.  See \nIndustry Br. 28 -29.   \nFurthermore, the information in BIA\u2019s email would not have chan ged how \nEPA determin ed the MACT floors.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(8) (\u201cIn reviewing alleged \nprocedural errors, the court may invalidate the rule only if the errors were so serious \nand related to matters of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made.\u201d).  In the absence of additional evidence, BIA\u2019s identification of factors \nthat it suspected might  potentially indicate unrepresentative emission s data would not \nhave provided sufficient justification for EPA to exclude data from low -emitting \nsources without fabric filter controls.  BIA did not show that the non -fabric filter data \nwere unreliable, nor did it provide additional data so that EPA could conclude that it \nhad information from all best -performing sources.  Without such evidence, EPA \ncould not have justified using data from 12 percent of sources in the industry \u2014i.e., \nfrom more than the top-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had emi ssions \ndata\u2014in finalizing the fabric filter-based proposed standards.  80 Fed.

The mercury standards for the brick industry are consistent with the \nstatute and congressional intent.  \nContrary to BIA\u2019s  argument, Industry Br. 29 -39, EPA determin ed the mercu ry \nMACT floor for the brick industry exactly as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  \nLegislative history cited by  BIA does not negate what the statute and case law require.  \nFurther, EPA reasonably found that sources can comply with the standard through means other than switching raw materials (although no such finding is necessary).  \nFinally, EPA reasonably declined to establish subcategories based on raw materials.  \nA. EPA appropriately determined the MACT floors for mercury and \nset standards at the floor leve ls. \nAs this Court has emphasized, \u201cEPA may not deviate from section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s \nrequirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve.\u201d  Sierra  Club, \n479 F.3d at 880 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cWhen setting the MACT floor, [  ] EPA considers only the performance of \nthe cleanest sources in a category . . . it does not take into account other factors, \nincluding the cost of putting a source in line with its better -performing counterparts.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 89 of 135\n-75- \n In its decision vacating the 2003 Rule, this Court held that where EPA had \nfound that raw material content has an appreciable effect on HAP emissions from \nbrick kilns, EPA could not set MACT floors based solely on the use of p ollution \ncontrol technology.  Sierra Club,  479 F.3d at 882- 83.  The Court stated that a purely \ntechnology -based approach would satisfy the CAA \u201cif pollution control technology \nwere the only  factor determining emission levels of that HAP.\u201d  Id.  at 882 (quoting \nCement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 863) (internal quotation marks and further citations omitted).  \nBy contrast, if factors other than technology \u201cinfluence a source\u2019s performance, it is not sufficient that EPA consider [ ] sources using only . . . MACT controls.\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 864- 65).     \nHere, EPA determined the mercury MACT floors for brick kilns by calculating \nthe emissions from the best-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had \nemissions information, as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  EPA set standards for \ntwo subcategories, small kilns and large kilns, and allowed kilns to use one of three \nalternative measurements to comply.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 /2-3, Table 4.  EPA set \nthe mercury standards under section 7412(d)(3) at the MACT floor level because it \nfound that more stringent limits (whi ch would have to be based on a beyond -the-floor  \nanalysis under section 7412(d)(2)) were \u201cnot reasonable relative to the level of emission reduction achieved\u201d due to the costs of addition al controls.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,638/2.  Further, because mercury emissions result from the mercury content in the raw clay used, and mercury content varies by the location where clay is quarried, EPA USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 90 of 135\n-76- \n developed a variability factor for mercury content in r aw clay and incorporated it into \nthe UPL equation used to determine the MACT floors.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2 -3.  \nAs a result, the final mercury standards are less stringent than the proposed standards.  \nCompare  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,628  Table 4 (proposing m ercury standards for large kilns as \n0.00002 2 pounds per ton) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 Table 4 (finalizing mercury \nstandards for large kilns as 0.000041 pounds per ton).  EPA  also noted that the \nmercury standards provide flexibility for sources by \u201callow ing a regulated source to \nchoose any control technology or technique to meet the emission limits, rather than \nrequiring each unit to use a prescribed control method.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,633/2.  \nSee also Brick Rule RTC at 27, JA 901 (\u201c[I]t is up to each fac ility to determine the type \nof emission control that works best for their particular situation.\u201d).  \nBIA\u2019s arguments that the mercury standards are invalid proceed from the \nincorrect assumption that EPA must ensure that all sources are able to achieve MACT \nfloor-based standards.  But that is not what the CAA requires.  Rather, this Court has \nclarified that the MACT floors must be set regardless of whether all sources can achieve them.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (stating that section 7412(d)(3) \u201climits the \nscope of the word \u2018achievable\u2019 in section 7412(d)(2),\u201d and  that \u201cEPA may not deviate \nfrom section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve by claiming that floors must be achievable by all sources using MACT technology\u201d);  Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v.

EPA\u2019s finding that sources could install controls or switch raw \nmaterials to meet the standards  was not a basis for the standards , \nbut was reasonable.  \nIn its response to comments, EPA noted that activated -carbon injection \ncontrol devices were an available compliance option for brick kilns.  See Brick Rule \nRTC at 13, 26-27, JA 894, 900-901.  BIA argues that because no sources in the \nindustry use such  devices to reduce mercury emissions, and EPA has not shown that \nthey would be effective, the controls are not a realistic compliance option, so that \nEPA has effectively required brick facilities to switch raw materials.  Industry Br. 30 -\n32. \nIn fact, the record fully supports EPA\u2019s statements concerning the \neffectiveness of activated carbon injection controls.  See  Brick Rule RTC at 26-27, \nJA900-901 (noting proven ef fectiveness of controls in similar industries and noting \nlack of evidence that controls would interfere with operation of brick sources).  See also Methodology and Assumptions Used to Estimate the Model Costs and Impacts of \nBSCP Air Pollution Control Devices for the Final Rule at 7 -9 (Sept. 24, 2015) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0662  (\u201cBrick Cost Memo\u201d), JA 870-872 (consider ing activated \ncarbon injection controls in the cost analysis).  Activated carbon injection controls \nhave proven effective in controlling mercur y emissions from similar sources in other \nindustries.  Brick Rule RTC  at 13, JA 894.  EPA has used its technical expertise to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 92 of 135\n-78- \n reasonably determine that such controls would be effective for the brick industry as \nwell.  That technical determination is entitle d to considerable deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.  Therefore, there is no basis for BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe \nonly available means of controlling mercury emissions is raw material substitution.\u201d  Industry Br. 32.   \nIn any event, as explained supra in Section VI.A , EPA does not need to \ndetermine how sources can meet the MACT floor, let alone whether  sources can meet \nthe MACT floor at all.  BIA\u2019s statement that EPA asserts that brick plants could meet the standard by \u201c switching to clay with lower mercury content,\u201d Industry Br. 30, \nwrongfully assumes that EPA\u2019s assertion  could have any bearing on the level s at \nwhich MACT floor -based standards were set.  While EPA noted in its cost analysis \nthat \u201cif significant amounts of  mercury are found at one location onsite, material \nfound at another onsite location with a lower mercury content could be used,\u201d Brick \nCost Memo at 9, JA 872, EPA  explained elsewhere that it was  \u201cnot requiring the use \nof offsite raw materials in this rule. \u201d  Brick Rule RTC  at 26, JA 900.  Stating that \nsources may be able to comply if they switched raw materials does not amount to a requirement.  But even if EPA had found that switching clays was the only way sources could comply with the standard s, that find ing would not have allowed EPA to \nset less stringent standard s, because the standard s are already at the MACT floor level.  \nSee Sierra  Club, 479 F.3d at 880.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 93 of 135\n-79- \n C. The CAA legislative history do es not prohibit raw material \nsubstitution requirements for brick kil ns. \nLargely ignoring the statutory text and this Court\u2019s decision in Sierra Club, BIA \nargues that legislative history indicates that EPA may not require raw materials \nsubstitution for brick kilns.  See Industry Br. 33 -34.  As explained supra in Sections \nVI.A and VI.B, this argument proceeds from the flawed premises that EPA must \nexplain how all sources could meet the standards, and that all sources must meet the \nstandards through raw material substitution.  E ven if BIA\u2019s premises were correct, \nthis argument would lack merit.   \nTo support its position, BIA c ites an explanatory statement in a Conference \nReport for the 1990 Amendments, which states that in setting standards for categories \nof sources \u201cengaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and pr ocessing of \nnonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in -process materials, the \nAdministrator shall not consider the substitution of, or other changes in, metal - or \nmineral -bearing raw materials that are used as feedstocks or materials i nputs, or metal - \nor mineral -bearing materials processed or derived from such feedstock s or materials.\u201d  \nIndustry Br. 33 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101 -952 at 339 , 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 1989).  \nHowever, the clear language of the statute requires EPA to determi ne the MACT \nfloor by estimating the emissions actually achieved by the best-performing existing sources.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (\u201cEPA may not deviate from section \n7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 94 of 135\n-80- \n achieve.  . . .\u201d).  The statutory language provides no allowance to set the MACT floor \nat a less stringent level if some sources would otherwise need to switch raw materials.  \nIndeed, Sierra Club held that MACT floors could not be justified by the Agency\u2019s \n\u201cconcer n that floors based on clean clay would be unachievable.\u201d  479 F.3d at 883.   \nBIA\u2019s request for en banc  review of Sierra Club or an Irons  footnote , Industry Br. \n38, is unjustified because no  prior conflicting  holdings are a t issue .  See Irons v. \nDiamond, 6 70 F.2d 265, 267-68, n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1981) .  As in the cases BIA cites, \n\u201c[t]his case does not present the very rare situation where the legislative history  of a \nstatute is more probative of congressional intent than the plain text.\u201d  Consumer Elecs. \nAss\u2019n v. FCC , 347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see Engine Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 88 \nF.3d 1075, 1088 (D.C.

Here, interpreting \nthe legislative history to deviate from the plain text of the CAA\u2019s MACT floor \nrequirements would uproot not only the holding of Sierra Club , but also this Court\u2019s \nlongstan ding precedent that MACT floors must be set at the lowest levels achieved.   \nFinally, while the directive of the statute is clear, the legislative history is not.  I t \nis not apparent that the statement even intended to refer to and include the brick industry among industries \u201cengaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and \nprocessing of nonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in -process USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 95 of 135\n-81- \n material s.\u201d  Although brick facilities could  be considered as \u201cprocessing\u201d clays and \nshales to produce bricks, it is not clear that these clays and shales are among the types \nof raw materials identified in the statement.26  Therefore, the plain language of the \nstatute, not legislative history, controls.  \nD. EPA\u2019s decision not to establish subcategories based on raw \nmaterials is rational and entitled to deference.  \nAt the time of proposal, EPA stated that it would consider subcategorizing \nbased on the mercury content of raw materials if data were provided showing \u201ca \ncorrelation between raw material content and mercury emissions and . . . sharp \ndisparities in raw material mercury content that readily differentiate among types of \nsources.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,650/3-51/1.  E PA specifically requested \u201cmercury \nemissions data coupled with raw materials mercury data.\u201d  Id.  at 75,651/1.  During the \nrulemaking , however, although EPA assumed a correlation existed between the \nmercury content of clay and mercury emissions, EPA did not  receive sufficient data to \nsubcategorize on that basis.  Brick Rule RTC at 13, JA 894.  Because emissions data \n                                                 \n26 If the legislative history were to have any controlling weight, it would only be to \nlimit EPA\u2019s considerations when setting beyond -the-floor standards for specific \nindustries.  This is because sect ion 7412(d)(2) allows EPA to consider ways in which \nsources could reduce emissions, such as materials substitution, in setting standards \nmore stringent than MACT floors.  And contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 34, \nthis interpretation is consistent w ith how EPA considered legislative history in a prior \nrulemaking.  See Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 988 (discussing EPA\u2019s decision not to \nset beyond- the-floor standards for copper smelters based in part on legislative history).  \n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 96 of 135\n-82- \n were collected years prior to data on raw material content,27 and because the mercury \ncontent of clay varies even within a quarry, see Mercury Con tent of Oklahoma and \nOhio Shale Deposits Supplying the Brick Industry at 6, 9 (T ables 1,  2) (Sept. 23, \n2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291-0659, JA805, 808, EPA could not demonstrate a \ncorrelation between the mercury content in the raw materials and mercury emissi ons.  \nAccordingly, EPA reasonably concluded that it could not justify subcategorization \nbased on raw material content.  \nBIA contends that subcategorization would \u201censure that MACT floors are truly \n\u2018achievable\u2019\u201d and would \u201cavoid the need for raw material sub stitution.\u201d  Industry Br. \n37.  As stated above, h owever, there is no requirement that MACT floors be \nachievable by all sources,28 nor has EPA required material substitution.  EPA \nexplained what data it would need to justify subcategories, but then  determine d that it \ndid not receive enough information to justify that approach.  EPA\u2019s decision not to \nsubcategorize based on raw materials is rational and entitled to deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.   \n                                                 \n27 While the most recent mercury emission test was conducted in 2011, see Cover \nSheet, \u201cTest run data showing mercury emissions and emissions of hydrogen fluoride \nin relation to other gases,\u201d JA924, the samples for raw material content were collected \nbetween 2013 and 2015.

TCNA lacks standing to challenge the standards for the tile industry \nand EPA\u2019s decision to list the major source category.  \nTCNA challenges EPA\u2019s promulgation of standards on the grounds that they \nare for a subcategory that did not include any major sources at the time of \npromulgation, and arg ues that the hypothetical possibility of a major source arising in \nthe industry in the future is not enough to support EPA\u2019s promulgation of the \nstandards.  Industry Br. 41.  As discussed in greater detail infra  at 85-88, although \nmajor sources in the tile  industry existed when EPA listed the category and were \nsubject to the 2003 Rule, no major sources in the tile industry were subject to the Clay Rule at the time it was promulgated.   \nIn challenging EPA\u2019s major source standards for the tile industry and EP A\u2019s \nlisting of the major source category including the tile industry, TCNA bears the \nburden of proving that it has Article III standing.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555 , 561 (1992) .  TCNA must show that its members suffer an injury caused by \nthe promulgation of the standards that could likely be redressed by this Court.  Id.  at \n560-61; Sierra v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 738-40  (1972) .  And TCNA must prove that \ninjury is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.   \nTCNA incorrectly claims that \u201c [t]he legitimacy of the promulgation is dependent \nupon TCNA\u2019s right to judicial review challenging it.\u201d  Industry Br. 18.  Rather, TCNA \nmust affirmatively establish its right to seek judicial review before its arguments may be considered.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at  560.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 98 of 135\n-84- \n To demonstrate that it satisfies Article III requirements, TCNA must show that \nat least one of its members likely would be subject to the standards.  But any such \ndemonstration would undermine TCNA\u2019s argument t hat EPA inappropriately \npromulgated the standards.  Accordingly, TCNA has not identified a single member who is or will be harmed, and has failed to allege specific facts sufficient to prove it has standing.  See Industry Br. 17 -18, Attachment B; Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n , 497 \nU.S. 871, 888 (1990) (holding \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d are insufficient to establish standing); Sierra Club v. EPA , 292 F.3d 895, 899 ( D.C. Cir. 2002) (finding petitioner\u2019s \nburden to prove standing is the same as a plaintiff\u2019s bur den at summary judgment).  If \nTCNA views the \u201chypothetical possibility\u201d of a future source becoming subject to the standards as so remote as to preclude EPA from promulgating the standards, then TCNA lacks standing to challenge them.  And as discussed infr a in Sections VIII -XII, \nTCNA\u2019s arguments fail on the merits even if this Court determines that TCNA has \nstanding.  \nVIII.  EPA complied with the CAA in setting standards for major sources in \nthe tile industry.  \nTCNA argues that the CAA requires that EPA issue standa rds under section \n7412(d)  only if it finds that there are major sources in the category that would be \nsubject to the standard s.  Industry Br. 39 -44.  This argument lack s merit.  EPA \nappropriately determined that there were major sources in the listed categ ory at the \ntime of listing, consistent with CAA requirements.  A fter EPA properly listed the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 99 of 135\n-85- \n category, the CAA required it to promulgate major source standards for sources in \nthat category.  Accordingly, EPA properly issued standards for the tile industry.     \nA. EPA set standards for major sources in the tile industry consistent \nwith CAA requirements.  \nIn the 1990 CAA amendments, Congress requ ired EPA to publish an initial \n\u201clist of all categories . . . of major sources,\u201d and certain area sources of HAPs.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1), (c)(3).  To supplement its initial list, EPA \u201cmay at any time list \nadditional categories . . . according to the same criteria for listing\u201d applicable under section 7412(c)(1) and (c)(3).  Id. \u00a7 7412(c)(3).   For major sources, the only \u201c criter [ion] \nfor listin g\u201d is that the category contain  major sources of HAPs.  See id.  Any person \ncan petition to have a category deleted  from the list, and EPA may delete a category \nonly if it makes certain determinations specified in section 7412(c)(9).  Id.  \u00a7 7412(c)(9); \nNew Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574, 578-79, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  Otherwise, once a category is listed, EPA must establi sh emission standards for major sources in that \ncategory.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (c)(5), (d)(1), (e)(1); see Sierra Club v. EPA, 850 F. \nSupp. 2d 300, 304 (D.D.C. 2012).   \nEPA promulgated  the Clay Rule consistent with those requirements.  In 1992, \nEPA pub lished the initial list of source categories, which included a \u201cclay products \nmanufacturing\u201d source category.

Industry Br. 39.  In other words, TCNA interprets subse ctions 7412(c)(1), \n(c)(2), and (d) to prohibit  EPA from setting standards for a listed source category \nunless major existing sources that will be subject to the standards remain in the listed \ncategory at the time of the standard s\u2019 promulgation.  Id. at 40.   This interpretation is \ninconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain text.   \nThe CAA  clearly provides that EPA must promulgate standards for listed \ncategories, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (e)(1), absent a decision to delist (see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(c)(9)).  Further, it is at the time of listing that EPA\u2019s determination that there are \nmajor sources in the category is relevant.  As explained supra in Section VIII.A, EPA  \nis required to list categories of major sources, and it is the listing of a category that triggers EPA\u2019 s obligation to set standards.  The CAA does not require EPA to \nreevaluate its decision to list a category before issuing standards.\n31  Indeed, this Court \n                                                 \n31 TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA interprets the statute to allow major source \n\u201cregulations for every existing or imaginable  industry, regardless of whether a major \nsource had been or would ever exist in the industry,\u201d Industry Br. 42, is incorrect.  \nRather, EPA interprets the statute to only direct it to list categories of major sources \nwhen the categories contain major source s.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at 31,579/3 (noting that USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 103 of 135\n-89- \n has considered unlawful EPA\u2019s removal of a source category from the list on any \nbasis other than th ose provided in section 7412(c)(9) , which does not authorize \ndelisting on the basis of a  finding that the source category no l onger contains major \nsources.  New Jersey , 517 F.3d at 582- 83. \nNor is there any reason to doubt that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation i s \nconsistent with congressional intent.  Congress required EPA to set standards for \nboth existing sources and new sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d) .  In requiring EPA to \nset standards for new  major sources, Congress clearly contemplated that EPA could \nset standards that might never apply, as it is possible that no new major sources would \nbe built in a source category.  \nFurther, even if no major existing sources are subject to the major source \nstandards when they are promulgated, those standards can still hav e environmental \nbenefits.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,508/3 -09/3 .  First, major sources in a given category may \nchoose to become synthetic area sources before major source standards go into effect, see Seitz Memo at 5 -7, JA 445-447, thus reducing th ose sources\u2019 emissions in advance \nof the reductions required by the standards.  Second, having major source standards \n                                                 \nEPA only listed categories of major sources \u201cwhere there was reasonable certainty \nthat at least one stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources \nin the category are commonly located on the premises of major sources\u201d).  Further, \nTCNA does not, and cannot , contend that major sources never existed  in the tile \nindustry.  See, e.g., Updated Inventory Database and Documentation fo r Clay Ceramics \nProposed Rule at 1 -3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0290- 0222 , JA264 -266 \n(describing  major tile industry sources); Astrachan Letter  at 1, JA261 (stating that \nformer major sources in the tile industry had become synthetic area sources). USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 104 of 135\n-90- \n in effect may deter natural area sources and synthetic area sources from increasing \ntheir emissions to avoid becoming subject to the major source standard s.  See Industry \nBr. Attachment B \u00b6\u00b6  5-7.  In the absence of major source standards, area and \nsynthetic area sources  might  have an incentive to increase emissions to become major \nsources.  And, as EPA explained, this incentive is greater when sources are a lready \nsubject to area source standards.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  Further, if EPA were required to identify a source emitting at major source levels at the time of setting standards , as preferred by TCNA , then it is possible that sources emitting at maj or \nsource levels could become synthetic area sources during the rulemaking process to head off the promulgation of major source standards.  See id.  Indeed , after EPA listed \nthe clay ceramics manufacturing  source category, and while EPA was in the process of \nsetting these standards, the remaining major sources in the tile industry become synthetic area sources.  See Astrachan Letter , JA260-262; Updated Inventory Database \nand Documentation for Clay Ceramics Proposed Rule  at 2-3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013 -0290- 0222 , JA265-266  (showing changes in tile industry sources\u2019 \nstatus).\n32  Under TCNA\u2019s interpretation, EPA would have to hold off on setting \nstandards for the listed source category until it could again identify a source emitting \n                                                 \n32 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, the distinction between a major sour ce and an area \nsource is not as clear as it may at first seem.  See supra Section IV.A.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 105 of 135\n-91- \n at major source levels,  at which point the source could become a synthetic area source \nand (again) foreclose EPA from setting standards.   \nIn addition to creating a regulatory loophole that would prevent EPA from \nsetting appropriate major source standards,33  TCNA\u2019s interpretatio n would be \nincredibly inefficient, as EPA would possibly need to rework or abandon proposed \nstandards every time sources changed their status.  In short, even if there were any \nambiguity in the statute (and there is not), EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable, and should be upheld under Chevron  step two.\n34 \nC. EPA complied with notice and comment procedures in issuing the \nstandards.  \nTCNA argues that it \u201cwas never afforded the opportunity to comment\u201d on \nEPA\u2019s position that listed sources must be regulated, and that it \u201chad no reasonable \nnotice of this position\u201d from the proposal.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA also argues that \n                                                 \n33 TCNA asserts that there is no such loophole because section 7412(j) applies to \nrequire case -by-case emission limits when section 7412(d) standards have been \nvacated, and cites a 2010 proposal to revise EPA\u2019s section 7412(j) rule as support.  \nIndustry Br. 41 n.6.  However, case -by-case standards are intended to be a stopgap for \nthe period of time before EPA promulgates standards for a source category, not a \npermanent su bstitute for source category standards.  Further, the existence of section \n7412(j) does not change EPA\u2019s duty to promulgate section 7412 standards for the clay \nceramics category.  See  Sierra Club, 850 F. Supp. 2d. at 304.  \n \n34 Additionally, because EPA did not act beyond the scope of the CAA, there is no \nlegitimate constitutional challenge to EPA\u2019s actions.  See Industry Br. 44 (arguing that \nEPA violated Article II).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 106 of 135\n-92- \n EPA\u2019s position was not a logical extension of the proposal.  Id.  at 46-47.  TCNA is \nwrong on all counts.   \nFirst, when EPA proposed standards in 2014, EPA specifically requested \ncomment on whether it must set major source standards for the tile industry in light \nof the fact that all of the major sources had become synthetic area sources.  79 Fed. \nReg. at 75,665/ 2-3.  But EPA also noted that it was required to set standards for the \nlisted clay ceramics manufacturing source category pursuant to section 7412(c), and \nthat the D.C. District Court had already found EPA\u2019s mandatory duty to set standards \nfor this listed  source category remained in place after vacatur of the 2003 Rule.  Id. at \n75,627/1-2.  Further, EPA\u2019s longstanding position, as reflected in its initial 1992 listing notice, is that the CAA requires EPA to set standards for listed sources.  See 57 \nFed. Re g. at 31,577/ 3.  In any event, EPA made clear it was proposing to set \nstandards for major sources in the tile industry, and TCNA had ample opportunity to \ncomment on all aspects of whether such regulation was legally appropriate.  See 79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,657- 58 (Tables 10,  11).   \nIX. TCNA cannot now challenge EPA\u2019s listing of the major source \ncategory, and its challenge is without merit.  \nA. TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing is untimely.  \nTCNA challenges EPA\u2019s section 7412(c) listing of the major source category \ncontain ing the tile industry.  EPA agrees that section 7412(e)(4) prohibits legal \nchallenges to EPA\u2019s decision to list categories of major sources prior to the issuance USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 107 of 135\n-93- \n of emission  standards.35  See Industry Br. 45.  However, TCNA\u2019s challenge to the \nlisting decisi on is un timely.  As provided in section 7412(e)(4), the time to challenge \nthe listing of a source category arises \u201cwhen the Administrator issues emission \nstandards for such . . . category.\u201d  With respect to the clay ceramics category, that occurred in 2003 , when EPA promulgated the initial Brick/Clay Rule.  At that time, \nTCNA had 60 days to challenge the category\u2019s listing.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(b)(1).  TCNA \ndid not do so.  Having waived its arguments concerning the validity of the listing \ndecision after the standards were issued in 2003, TCNA cannot now assert them.  The vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not change or affect the prior listing , and does not \nchange TCNA\u2019s inability to raise this argument.  Petitioners had an opportunity to challenge the listing and fa iled to pursue any timely challenge.  \nFurther, it would be nonsensical to read Section 7412(e)(4) to allow litigants to \nreassert challenges to the listi ng decision every time emission  standards are issued, \nreissued or revised for a category.  Section 7412( e)(4) is more reasonably read to allow \nEPA to list categories of major sources of HAPs and begin the process of setting emission  standards for those categories without interruption from protracted \nlitigation.  In short, Congress provided an opportunity to challenge listing decisions, \n                                                 \n35 Section 7412(e)(4) states that \u201cno action of the Administra tor . . . listing a source \ncategory or subcategory under subsection (c) of this section shall be a final agency \naction subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be reviewed under \nsubsection 7607 of this title when the Administrator issues emission standards for \nsuch . . . category.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(e)(4).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 108 of 135\n-94- \n even though it delayed judicial review of the listing of a category until after emission \nstandards for that category were issued, but Congress limited the timeframe for \nchallenges  to EPA\u2019s actions.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss TCNA\u2019s challenge \nto the listing decision as untimely, and need not reach the merits of this issue.  \nB. EPA\u2019s listing of the major source category was proper.   \nEven if TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing were timely, it would fail on the merits.  \nTCNA claims that the listing was not adequately supported, and was unlawfully \nfinalized because EPA failed to provide notice and an opportunity to comment.  Industry Br. 44 -47.  TCNA is wrong on both counts.  \n1. EPA adequately supported its basis for the listing.  \nTCNA argues that there must be a \u201ccitation in the relevant EPA docket to a \nmajor source\u201d in the tile industry before EPA can promulgate section 7412(d) standards for the industry.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA cites the initial 1992 listing notice \nand claims that  the docket contains no citation to any sources in the ceramic tile \nmanufacturing industry.  Id.   This argument misses the mark.  EPA replaced the 1992 \nlisting of the clay products manufacturing category with the listing of the clay \nceramics manufacturing category in 2002, at the same time that it proposed setting \nstandards for the listed category.  Because the 2002 listing superseded the 1992 listing, any challenge TCNA would have to the listing would be to EPA\u2019s 2002 decision.  See 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/ 2-3.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 109 of 135\n-95- \n When EPA listed the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2002, it had \nample information to conclude that sources in that category, including tile industry sources , \nwere major sources.  See supra  note 30; 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,91 3/3-1 4/1; Documentation \nof Database of Responses to the 1997 EPA Information Collection Request for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing  at 306-09 (Table 11) (Dec. 6, 2001), A-2000- 48; II -B-20, \nJA205-208 (showing four major sources in the tile industry).  And the fact that there \nwere major sources at the time of listing cannot be disputed.  Further, prior to the promulgation of the 2003 Rule, EPA received no comments challenging t he listing of \nthe category based on the absence of major tile industry sources.  See generally 2003 \nClay Rule Summary of Public Comments and Responses (Feb. 2003) , A-2000-48, IV -\nA-1 (\u201c2003 Clay Rule RTC \u201d), JA214.   \nEven if TCNA could challenge the initial 1992 listing, whether the docket for \nthe initial list identifies any ceramic tile manufacturing sources has no effect on the \nvalidity of the listing, because the listed category at that time was clay products \nmanufacturing.\n36  EPA needed only to conclude th at there were major sources in the \ncategory it listed , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(c)(1),  and EPA did just that.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at \n31,591/3 (Table 1), 31,592/3 n.a.  EPA\u2019s rationale for listing all categories, including \nclay products manufacturing, was based on \u201cr easonable certainty that at least one \n                                                 \n36 TCNA is careful to describe its challenge to the listing based on a lack of material in \nthe docket \u2014rather than claiming that major sources in the tile industry did not exist \nat that time\u2014presumably because it could not credibly asse rt that there were not \nmajor til e industry sources at the time.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 110 of 135\n-96- \n stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources in the category \nare commonly located on the premises of major sources.\u201d   Id. at 31,579/3.  And EPA \nexplicitly found that it had \u201cinformation indicating that [the clay products manufacturing] source category contains a major source.\u201d  Documentation for \nDeveloping the Initial Source Category List, Final Report at B-45 (July 1992) , A-90-\n49, IV -A-55/V-B-1, JA928.  Although the tile industry would later be described as \npart of the initially- listed clay products manufacturing category, see supra at 85-86, \nthere is no requirement that at the time EPA listed the category, it had to identify major sources of every industry that might later be co nsidered part of that initially -\nlisted category.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1) (requiring publication, and revision if \nappropriate, of a list of categories of major sources).\n37  Therefore, EPA\u2019s 1992  listing \nof the cla y products manufacturing category as a major source category pursuant to \nsection 7412(c)(1) was valid . \n                                                 \n37 EPA explained that in proposing standards for each category, it planned to revise \nthe list and better describe the industries in each categ ory.  57 Fed. Reg. at 31,590/3 -\n91/1.  This approach ensured that as EPA accumulated information and developed \nproposed standards for a category, it could properly describe the sources within the \nlisted category that would be subject to the standards.  See, e.g., 67 Fed. Reg. at \n47,896/2-3, 47,898/3- 99/2, 47,913/3-14/1 (replacing one initially-listed category with \ntwo categories and describing sources in those categories).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 111 of 135\n-97- \n 2. TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the 2002 \nlisting decision in the rulemaking for the 2003 Rule.  \nTCNA had notice and an opportunity to comment on the listing in 2002, when \nEPA  proposed standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category.38  67 Fed. \nReg. at 47,896/ 2-3.  Providing notice of and opportunity to comment on the listing at \nthe time standards are proposed is consistent with section 74 12(e)(4), which provides \nthat the window  for judicial review commences when EPA issues  emission standards.   \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(4).  This approach is also pragmatic:  it allows EPA to better \ndescribe the sources within the listed category that will be subject to the standards; \nand until standards are developed, listing of a category has no actual effect on its sources.  See supra note 37.  In the  2002 proposal preamble , EPA explained that it was \nreplacing the clay products source category with two categories, including the clay ceramics manufacturing category.  67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/2 -3.  EPA requested \ncomment on the listing and the sources covered by the listing.  Id.  at 47,896/3.  After \npublication of the 2002 proposal , TCNA could not credibly claim that its members \nhad no notice of the listing and no opportunity to comment on it.  In fact, tile companies commented  that EPA \u201cshould delist ceramic tile roller kilns from the final \n[standards].\u201d   Comments on  Proposed Rule Submitted for American Marazzi Tile and \nMonarch Ceramic Tile at 32 (C omment  4) (Sept. 19, 2002), A -2000-48 , IV-D-07, \n                                                 \n38 Although TCNA asserts these claims under the APA, these claims can only be \nconsidere d, if at all, under CAA section 7607.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(1).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 112 of 135\n-98- \n JA209; 2003 Clay Rule RTC at 2-38, JA 214.  Therefore EPA has satisfied any notice \nand comment requirements for the listing.  \nX. EPA reasonably set the dioxin/furan standards and adequately \nresponded to public comment.  \nIn the Clay Rule, EPA issued numeric dioxin/furan MACT emission limits for \nall new and existing ceramic tile roller kilns, sanitaryware tunnel kilns, floor tile press \ndryers, and ceramic tile spray dryers.  80 Fed. Reg . at 65,478 /3, T able 5.  TCNA \nargues that the dioxin/furan standards are not based on \u201cemissions information\u201d \nbecause EPA requested that sources use a flawed test method to report emissions.  Industry Br. 48 -50.  Additionally, TCNA argues that EPA did not comply with notice \nand comment procedures and that the standards were not a logical outgrowth of the proposal.  Id. at 51.  These arguments lack merit.  EPA prov ided su fficient support for \nthe test method.  Additionally, TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the use \nof the test method, and EPA responded to TCNA\u2019s comments.   \nA. EPA reasonably determined that Method 23 provided emissions \ninformation that could be u sed in determining MACT floors for \nceramic tile sources.  \nBecause each tile industry subcategory contained less than 30 sources, EPA \ndetermin ed the MACT floors based on the lowest-emitting 5 sources for which EPA \nhad emissions information.   See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(B).

See, e.g., 2010 Section 114 Information Collection Request to \nDal-Tile Corp. , Enclosure 3 at 1 -3 (Table 1.1) (Mar. 9, 2010), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290- 0023, JA218- 220.  EPA used the information submitted in response to \ndetermin e the dioxin/furan MACT floors for the tile industry.  See Clay MACT Floor \nMemo  at 2, 8 -12, JA336, 342-346. \nTCNA argues that Method 23 is outdated and does not account for naturally -\noccurring non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials used by the \ntile industry.  Industry Br. 49.  For this reason, TCNA argues that Method 23 \nerroneously reports n on-gaseous dioxin/furan as emissions, and therefore the data \nproduced by Method 23 are not \u201cemissions information.\u201d  TCNA asserts that EPA \nignored this problem and unlawfully relied on the Method 23 data.

Furthermore, the fact that EPA is working to revise  Method 23, Industry \nBr. 49- 50, does not invalidate the data collected using the method.  See Clay Rule RTC \nat 15, JA 393.  EPA specifically determined that the method produced useful emissions \ninformation for ceramic tile sources, and TCNA \u201cfailed to demonstrate that EPA\u2019s [method] \u2018bears no rational relationship to the reality it purports to represent. \u2019\u201d Cement \n                                                 \n41 Cont rary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 48, EPA is not required to make an \nexplicit finding in the rulemaking docket that test data or other sources of information \nEPA considers are \u201cemissions information.\u201d   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 115 of 135\n-101-  \n Kiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (quoting Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. v.

See Cement \nKiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (noting that the Court will \u201cdefer to an agency\u2019s dec ision to \nproceed on the basis of imperfect scientific information, rather than to invest \nresources to conduct the perfect study,\u201d and finding reasonable EPA\u2019s interpretation \nthat \u201cemissions information\u201d in section 7412(d)(3) included compliance data gather ed \nunder another statute  (quoting Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 662) (internal quotation  marks  \nomitted)).   \nB. EPA provided notice and adequately responded to comments \nregarding the dioxin/furan standards.  \nEPA provided sufficient opportunity for TCNA to comment on EPA\u2019s use of \nMethod 23, and EPA was not required to describe in the proposal its justification  for \nusing Method 23.  See  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3) (requiring a statement of the basis and \npurpose of a proposed rule, including a summary of the factual data and  methodology \nused).

As required, EPA responded to those comments and provided \njustification for using Method 23.  Clay Rule RTC at 11-19, JA 389-397.  \nFurther, EPA considered and rejected TCNA\u2019s arguments against using \nMethod 23.  EPA explained that \u201cthe quality control inherent in the method provides USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 116 of 135\n-102-  \n adequate support for the validity and accuracy of the emission results.\u201d  Clay Rule \nRTC at 12, JA 390.  In responding to TCNA\u2019s concern that Method 23 does not \naccount for non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials, EPA explained that it had no basis to conclude (and TCNA did not provide any) that TCNA\u2019s concern was warranted.  Id.   Method 23 had been successfully implemented \nto measure dioxin/furan from other source categories, and EPA noted that the same requirements for evaluating the validity of the data still applied.  Id. at 12, 16, JA390, \n394.  EPA reviewed the Method 23 data submitted by tile industry sources and found they \u201cmet method requirements\u201d and \u201cgenerated valid data on emission concentration.\u201d  Id. at 12, JA 390; see id. at 16 -18, JA 394-396 (describing validation \nmethodology  for data collected from tile industry sources). \nIn characterizing EPA\u2019s response to TCNA\u2019s comments in the preamble as \u201ca \nsix-sentence non -responsive brush-off,\u201d Industry Br. 51, TCNA overlooks (1) EPA\u2019s \nmore thorough responses to TCNA\u2019s comments in its r esponse -to-comments \ndocument, see Clay Rule RTC at 1 2-19, JA 390-397; and (2) the fact that the cited \nstatements in the preamble, 80 Fed.

And with respect to TCNA\u2019s \nargument that EPA\u2019s final rule was not a logical outgrowth of the proposal, see Industry Br. 51, EPA did not change its position:  EPA proposed to and did use \nMethod 23.  Thus, the question of logical outgrowth does not even arise here.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 117 of 135\n-103-  \n XI. EPA\u2019s decision not to set standards for periods of malfunction is \nreasonable and entitled to deference.  \nTCNA argues that EPA arbitrarily and capriciously failed to set standards for \nperiods of malfunction.  Industry Br. 52.  Because EPA did not use emissions data \nfrom periods of malfunction in setting standards, TCNA argues that EPA unlawfully \nset standards that EPA knew the regulated community had not and could not achieve.  \nId. at 53.  TCNA is wrong and ignores clear precedent that is contrary to its position.  \nThis Court recently recognized that because the best- controlled similar source \nis unlikely to be a malfunctioning source, the CAA, if anything, \u201cprevents [  ] EPA \nfrom takin g into account the effect of potential malfunctions when setting MACT \nemission standards\u201d and \u201c[a]t the very least\u201d \u201cpermits [  ] EPA to ignore malfunctions \nin its standard -setting and account for them instead through its regulatory discretion.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  TCNA seeks to \ndistinguish the standards at issue here from the boiler standards at issue in U.S. Sugar  \nby arguing that, in this case, the docket contained information from a single facility \nduring som e malfunction events.  Industry Br. 52.  TCNA cites data from times when \nemission control devices were shut down, resulting in higher than normal emission levels.  See Dal Italia Responses to EPA 2010 Information Collection Request Startup \nand Shutdown Events  (Sept. 22, 2010) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0290-0028, Enclosure 1 \n(\u201cDal Italia Responses\u201d), JA 238-241.  Although some portions of the data were from \nmalfunctions of control  devices, EPA reasonably did not use those data to set USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 118 of 135\n-104-  \n standards.  EPA\u2019s rationale here is essentially the same as the rationale upheld in U.S. \nSugar .  Compare 830 F.3d at 606-09 (noting that EPA based its position on \u201cthe \nimpracticality of accounting for events that are necessarily unpredictable\u201d and that \nEPA explained that it would use its enforcement discretion to determine when \nemission exceedances were excusable) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3-83/2 (explaining \nthe impracticability of accounting for malf unctions in setting standards and asserting \nEPA would use its enforcement discretion).  As this Court has acknowledged, \u201c[w]hile the existence of malfunctions is entirely predictable, the nature of those malfunctions is not, and it is the malfunction\u2019s nature that affects emissions and thus is relevant to the application of emission limits.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And the Court \nupheld EPA\u2019s decision not to set alternative standards to cover malfunctions because \nthe decision to set those standards is purely within EPA\u2019s discretion and any such \nstandard applicable to malfunctions \u201cis likely to be hopelessly generic to govern such \na wide array of circumstances.\u201d  I d. at 608.  Here as well, EPA reasonably declined to \nconsider malfunction data in setting the standards.  See  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3 \n(explaining that \u201caccounting for malfunctions in setting emission standards would be difficult , if not impossible\u201d).  Further, EPA adequately explained why it did not rely \non malfunction data.  Id.  at 65,482/3-8 3/2; Clay Rule RTC at 73 -74, JA 406-407.\n42   \n                                                 \n42 EPA disagrees with TCNA\u2019s assertion that it \u201ck nows from data in the docket that \nthe regulated community has not and cannot achieve [the] standards.\u201d  Industry  Br. \n53.  Because malfunctions are unpredictable, there is no way of knowing when they USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 119 of 135\n-105-  \n TCNA also argues that EPA should have identified legal defenses in the \nregulation s.  Industry Br. 54.   To the extent TCNA seeks to have EPA write \naffirmative defenses into the regulations to protect sources that e xceed  standards due \nto malfunctions , this Court\u2019s past decisions clearly bar EPA from doing so.  NRDC  v. \nEPA , 749 F.3d at 1057 ; U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And, to the extent TCNA seeks \nto have EPA simply list defenses without adopting them or otherwise changing their \navailability, doing so  would neither affect  a defense\u2019s availability  nor change a court \u2019s \nrole to determine what, if any, defenses are properly con sidered in determin ing \npenalties.  NRDC  v. EPA, 749 F.3d at 1063.  In any event, EPA\u2019s statement that a \nsource \u201ccan raise any and all defenses,\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,483/2, simply states the \nlaw, and does not require or empower EPA to specify what defenses c ould possibly \nbe asserted.   \nXII. The mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile sources do \nnot require the use of activated carbon injection controls.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that the mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile \nkilns, spray dryers, an d tile dryers unlawfully require installation of activated carbon \ninjection controls is based on numerous flawed premises.  See Industry Br. 55 -56.  \nFirst, TCNA incorrectly suggests that the standards require use of a particular control \ntechnology.  Simila r to the brick standards discussed supra in Section VI, EPA set the \n                                                 \nwill occur or what their  effect on emissions will be.  EP A therefore reasonably set the \nstandards based on emissions information demonstrating what sources have achieved.  \nSee U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 120 of 135\n-106-  \n standards for the tile industry in the form of numeric emission limits, at the MACT \nfloor levels.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,478 /2-3, Table 5.  Such standards do not require \nthe use of any pa rticular control technology, but instead allow for flexibility in the \nmethod sources use to comply.  Clay Rule RTC at 10 4, 10 5, JA 409, 410 (noting that \n\u201c[i]ndustry may use whatever means and methods they deem necessary to achieve \ncompliance with the emissi on limits\u201d).  And because the standards were set at the \nMACT floor level, they are based on emissions from the best-performing sources.  See \nid. at 103, JA 408.  The cost of using controls was not (nor could it have been) a \nconsideration in determin ing the MACT floor.  I d.; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d); NRDC v. \nEPA , 489 F.3d 1364, 1376 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[C]ost is not a factor that EPA may \npermissibly consider in setting a MACT floor.\u201d).   \nSecond, contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA was not required to conduct a \nbeyon d-the-floor analysis to prove that activated carbon injection controls would be \neffective for tile industry  sources.  See NRDC v. EPA, 489 F. 3d at 1376 (\u201c[The \npetitioner] relies on an incorrect premise that the MACT level of emissions reduction is invalid if it is based on control technology that a source cannot install.\u201d).  Although  \nin response to comments, EPA explained that activated carbon injection controls \nwould be appropriate for controlling mercury and dioxin/furan emissions for sources in the  tile industry, Clay Rule RTC at 104, JA 409, this was not a consideration in \nsetting the standard s and therefore would not be a valid basis for vacating the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 121 of 135\n-107-  \n standards even if EPA had failed to support its reasoning.43  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d); \nNRDC  v. EPA, 489 F .3d at 1376.  \nFinally, TCNA\u2019s argument that the cost of using activated carbon injection  \ncontrols  would be unconscionable, see Industry Br. 56, fails to present a legitimate \nlegal attack on the standards.  Because EPA set the standards at the MACT floor \nlevel, EPA was prohibited from setting less stringent standards based on costs.  NRDC  v. EPA, 489 F.3d at  1375 -76.\n44  Instead, th e standards must be based on \nemission levels actually achieved in the source category.  TCNA\u2019s challenge to the mercury and dioxin/furan emission standards for ceramic tile sources should \ntherefore be rejected.  \nXIII.  EPA set the standards for sanitaryware source s in compliance with the \nCAA.  \nTo obtain information for determin ing the MACT floor for sanitaryware \nsources, EPA sent information collection requests to manufactures of sanitaryware.  \n                                                 \n43 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA did  conduct a beyond -the-floor analysis and \nconcluded that, for tile in dustry sources, \u201cthe incremental costs of additional control \nabove the MACT floor emission limits are not reasonable relative to the level of \nemission reduction achieved.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,659/3.  Based on this finding, EPA \nproposed setting standards at the MACT floor levels.  Id.  \n \n44 It is only where EPA sets a more stringent \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d standard that it has \nto justify the more stringent standards by considering control types, costs, and other \nfactors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2); NRDC  v. EPA, 749 F .3d at 1057.  See also White \nStallion , 748 F .3d at 1238-39 (noting that costs are reflected in MACT floor standards \nto the extent that MACT floors are determin ed based on what is already achieved by \nsources, which presumably reflects what is cost-effective).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 122 of 135\n-108-  \n See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1-2 .  One source from which EPA requested emi ssions \ninformation had installed controls to comply with the new source MACT standards \nfrom the 2003 Rule.  See id. at 65,510/1.  That source, \u201cKiln 10,\u201d had stopped running \nthe controls in 2009, after its state operating permit was modified to reflect the  \nvacatur of the 2003 Rule.  Industry Br. 57 -58; see 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1.  However, \nthe controls remained functional and attached to the source.  See Industry Br. 58; 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,510/1 -2.  When EPA requested information from Kiln 10, it \nrequested that information be gathered while the controls were operating.  See 80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,510/ 1-2. \nKohler argues that EPA should have based its MACT floor calculations on  \ndata from when Kiln 10 was operating without  its controls.  Industry Br. 56 -63.  \nKohler contends that the Kiln 10 data were not representative of any existing source \noperating at the time when EPA determined the MACT floors, and that the MACT \nfloors for s anitaryware are improperly based on emissions data originating from a \nvacated standard, rather than on the actual performance of the best-performing sources.  Id.  Additionally, Kohler argues that the standards are inconsistent with \nEPA\u2019s stated objective that emission standards should reflect real -world performance.  \nId. at 62.   These arguments are wrong.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 123 of 135\n-109-  \n A. EPA set the MACT floors as required by the CAA, based on what \nhas been achieved.  \nKohler argues that EPA violated the CAA requirement that MACT floors be \nbased on the actual performance of the best-performing sources by artificially creating \na better -performing source.  Industry Br. 58.  EPA did nothing of the sort.  \nThe CAA requires EPA to set the MACT floors based on the \u201caverage \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources\u201d for which EPA has \nemissions information or could reasonably obtain emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  The CAA does not set a time limit for when the emissions \ninformation that EPA uses in setting the MA CT floor is collected, nor does it specify \ncriteria for what emissions information may be used to show what has been achieved; it simply requires that the emissions limitation has been \u201cachieved.\u201d  See id.  Kohler  \nprovided dat a to EPA demonstrating emissio n levels Kiln 10 actually achieved with \ncontrols.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1-2.\n45  Although Kiln 10 does not currently operate \nthe controls, that does not change the fact that it had \u201cachieved\u201d emission  reductions \nwith the controls.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  And the data provided to EPA were not \nhypothetical speculation on what Kiln 10 could potentially achieve.  Rather, it was real-world emissions information that was produced from the actual operation of Kiln \n                                                 \n45 Kiln 10 not only provided data showing levels it had achieved during testing, it had \noperated for several years with controls.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1.  In fact, Kiln \n10 was operating its controls in the year preceding EPA\u2019s request for emissions \ninformation.  Id.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 124 of 135\n-110-  \n 10.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/2.   Because info rmation from Kiln 10 demonstrated \nemission  levels actually achieved by the source, EPA permissibly relied on it in \ndetermin ing the MACT floors.46  \nB. EPA was not required to omit emissions data bec ause a source \nachieved emission reductions to comply with a vac ated standard.  \nKohler argues that because Kiln 10\u2019s controls were installed to comply with a \nstandard that was subsequently vacated, EPA should be prohibited from using Kiln \n10\u2019s emissions inf ormation.  Industry Br. 56 -60.  But vacatur of the 2003 Rule does \nnot affect the appropriateness of EPA\u2019s use of the Kiln 10 data.  Although the vacatur invalidated the obligation to comply with the 2003 standards, it did not erase the ability of the source to demonstrate emission  reductions that were actually achieved  in \npractice.  This Court has ruled that EPA acted lawfully in setting MACT floors using data collected from sources complying with a remanded standard.  Med . Waste Inst ., \n645 F.3d at 426.  The Court explained that it was \u201cnot persuaded that remand without \nvacatur as opp osed to vacatur has the outcome -changing significance that petitioners \nascribe to it.\u201d  Id.   The same principle applies where, as here, a standard has been \nvacated.  EP A had no reason to doubt that the data from Kiln 10 demonstrat ed \nanything other than emission reductions that the source had actually achieved.  See 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,510/2.

The co-signers\u2019 institutional affiliations are included for identification purposes \nonly and do imply institutional endorsement or support. We appreciate the opportunity to provide  \nwritten comments on EPA\u2019s Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) \n(hereafter referred to as the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation) conducted under the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA),1 which requires EPA to evaluate chemical risks based on the \u201cbest available \nscience.\u201d2 TCEP is a flame retardant chemical that is also used as a plasticizer and in paints and \ncoatings.  \nEPA appropriately determined that TCEP as a whole chemical presents unreasonable risk to \nhuman health and the environment based on high risks of cancer (including some exposures \nexceeding 1-in-1,000 cancer risk) and non-cancer effects to workers, consumers and the general \npopulation from multiple TCEP conditions of use. However, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation \nalso failed to evaluate risks for several conditions of use and relied  on scientific methods and \nassessments that are not consistent with the \u201cbest av ailable science,\u201d3 which can lead to \nunderestimating risk to human and environmental health.   \nEPA continued to rely on a systematic review methodology that is not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA \u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. The National Academies of \nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) recommended the use of exis ting systematic \nreview methods and improved approaches for TSCA risk ev aluations in 2021, and EPA has still \nnot implemented most of these recommendations.\n4 EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on \nChemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) has also recommended best practices in systemati c review to the Agency in \nmultiple reports.5  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is \naligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review \nprotocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.     \nThe TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation also relied on a hazard assessment that violates TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest \navailable science\u201d requirement. While EPA found that neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, \ndevelopmental toxicity, kidney toxicity and cancer  are all likely hazards of TCEP , it failed to \n1 U.S. EPA (2023) .

EXHIBIT E\n    \n 2 provide quantitative estimates of non-cancer risk. We applied methods developed by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) to quantify the non-cancer risk of male reproductive harm from chronic oral TCEP exposure, and found that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of exposures producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40, a risk level 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (1-in-1,000,000). EPA also inappropriately stated that a threshold exists for cancer risk, and did not appropriately use science-based adjustment factors.  EPA also failed to adequately identify and calculate risks posed to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (\u201cPESS\u201d), as required under TSCA.6  Among the populations exposed to high risks from TCEP are breast-fed infants and people who consume fish (fishers in the general population, subsistence fishers and tribal populations), but EPA failed to consider individuals with pre-existing disease, genetic factors, lifestyle factors, or exposures to other chemical and non-chemical stressors that may increase susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposure. A failure to evaluate risk to these groups violates TSCA and results in risk characterization that is not representative of the human population.   EPA also failed to estimate risks for some TCEP conditions of use (for example, cushions in commercial furniture, consumer paints), claiming that it lacked sufficient data and that most of these uses have been discontinued  EPA is obligated under TSCA to estimate risks for all conditions of use that are \u201creasonably foreseen.\u201d7 Since any use that is voluntarily discontinued could resume, they should be considered \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d and EPA should include risk estimates for these uses in the final TCEP risk evaluation. TSCA also requires EPA to consider \u201creasonably available information\u201d when conducting risk evaluations,8 which includes data and information that EPA \u201ccan reasonably generate, obtain, and synthesize for use in risk evaluations.\u201d9 EPA failed to use its authority under TSCA to fill critical data gaps that could result in a more complete assessment of conditions of use. EPA also failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) in time to generate chemical release data to inform exposure assessments in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, which precluded its ability to adequately assess fenceline community exposures and risks.   Finally, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is the first EPA has released since it completed the initial 10 risk evaluations conducted under the amended TSCA in January 2021, and the first to not undergo panel peer review by EPA\u2019s SACC. EPA relied on the SACC to conduct panel peer reviews of the first 10 risk evaluations as well as EPA\u2019s proposed methods for fenceline assessment and systematic review to be used in the forthcoming risk evaluations, and provided EPA with numerous critical recommendations for improvement. For the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA has chosen to conduct a letter peer review, which precludes collaboration and consensus among reviewers and transparency and public participation in the review process, all of which are critical to maintaining scientific integrity and addressing potential financial conflicts of interest among reviewers. SACC panel peer review would also enable the examination of cross-cutting issues that arise in multiple evaluations and the extent to which EPA has addressed previous SACC recommendations, including those made to improve the fenceline  6 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12). 7 15 USC \u00a72602 (4). 8 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(k). 9 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.33 (defining \u201creasonably available information\u201d). \n    \n 3 screening methodology. We therefore urge EPA to conduct a SACC panel peer review for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and all TSCA risk evaluations that are currently in development  Our detailed comments on the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation address the following issues:  1. EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required. a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook. b. EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review. c. Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices. i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the risk evaluation. ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete. iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes. iv. The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  v. EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard and risk assessment. a. EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed. c. EPA failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects. This along with other appropriate factors needs to be added into the assessment.   3. EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.         \n    \n 4 We appreciate the opportunity to provide public input.

EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required.  a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook.   We support EPA\u2019s decision to discard the quantitative scoring method, which was previously used in TSCA systematic reviews and methodology documents to assess study quality and exclude some studies from consideration based on their quantitative scores, despite repeated criticism from peer reviewers and public commenters. EPA originally put forward its approach to systematic review under TSCA in 2018.10  In its review of the 2018 TSCA systematic review method, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) said:  The reliance on numeric quality scores is problematic because scores do not distinguish between high- and low-quality studies, and the relationship between quality scores and an association or effect is inconsistent and unpredictable\u2026More generally, the use of numerical scoring in critical appraisal does not follow standards for the conduct of systematic reviews.11     Do not use numeric scores to evaluate studies.12    In 2021, EPA released its Draft Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Systematic Review Protocol (hereafter referred to as the 2021 Draft TSCA Method), asserting that this document addressed the NASEM recommendations.  However, the 2021 draft retained a quantitative study scoring method.  The review of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method by EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) reiterated the earlier NASEM recommendation:  EPA should follow NASEM recommendations and best practices of systematic review by removing its approach to determine an overall quality score based on the combination of quantitative ratings of each individual data quality evaluation metric, which is essentially a quantitative scoring approach.13  Since completion of the SACC review of the 2021 method, EPA has not issued an updated systematic review methodology.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and its systematic review protocol provide the first indication of how EPA will proceed in conducting TSCA systematic review.  According to the risk evaluation and the protocol, EPA has now taken an important step by discarding the previous quantitative study scoring approach:   10 U.S. EPA (2018).

EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review.   The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation retains certain study quality evaluation metrics that are not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA\u2019s requirement for EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d16 when conducting risk evaluations and make decisions based on the \u201cweight of the scientific evidence.\u201d17 EPA\u2019s approach to study quality evaluation typically applies a set of metrics that assessors must evaluate for each relevant study during systematic review. The TCEP systematic review protocol states that the study quality metrics in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method were retained for the TCEP risk evaluation without revision (with the exception of minor edits to one toxicology metric).18  In applying the 2021 metrics, EPA inappropriately applied metrics to evaluate study quality based on statistical power and statistical significance, disregarding recommendations by the NASEM.  In The Use of Systematic Review in EP A's Toxic Substances Control Act Risk Evaluations, the NASEM stated that:   Many markers of a high-quality study (e.g., whether a study\u2019s investigator has performed a sample size calculation and whether the study is reported adequately or has received appropriate ethical approvals) are unlikely to have any direct implication for the potential for a study to be affected by bias.19  Statistical power and statistical significance are not markers of risk of bias or quality. Statistical significance is not a measure of association or strength of association and should not be used to evaluate studies. In fact, combining multiple  14 U.S. EPA (2023).

Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices.  i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Along with TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA released a Systematic Review Protocol for the Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) as a supplemental file.  This is the first time EPA has released a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for a TSCA systematic review, which is consistent with best available scientific methods in systematic review and responds to recommendation of the NASEM and the SACC.    However, for future TSCA risk evaluations, EPA must publish a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for public comment first in the process of conducting each risk evaluation (well in advance of completing the draft risk evaluation), which is also consistent with best practices for systematic review.22,23  EPA\u2019s TSCA program should follow the established procedures of EPA\u2019s IRIS program, which makes a draft protocol for each assessment publicly available in advance of its release for public comment. Following the public comment process, the IRIS program then publishes an updated protocol, as needed. For example, for the IRIS assessments of five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d), a draft protocol was made available for public comment for 45 days. The IRIS program then followed up with a revised protocol to address public comments, with documentation of the changes, that was published before the release of the PFAS draft assessments.24  EPA should be following this same approach for all TSCA risk evaluations.   ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete.  The application of systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation includes elements that are not included in the TCEP systematic review protocol.  For example, EPA\u2019s TCEP systematic review protocol continues to require an overall study quality rating. EPA says that it is no longer  20 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2021).

The draft risk evaluation\u2019s description of the approach to human health hazard assessment includes:  EPA considered studies that received low, medium, or high overall quality determinations for hazard identification, evidence integration, and dose-response analysis\u2026Information from studies of uninformative quality were only discussed on a case-by-case basis for hazard identification and evidence integration and were not considered for dose-response analysis. For example, if an uninformative study identified a significantly different outcome compared with high- or medium-quality studies and the uninformative rating was not expected to influence the specific results being discussed, EPA considered the uninformative study for the hazard outcome being considered.25  (emphasis added)  The systematic review protocol, however, does not state that the overall quality ratings that may be selected for a study are high, medium, low, or uninformative, nor does it state how ratings of the many individual study metrics are combined to determine an overall rating.  The study quality term \u201cuninformative\u201d does not appear anywhere in the protocol. This indicates that the TSCA Draft Risk Evaluation is inappropriately applying methods that are not stated in the systematic review protocol.  To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should not derive an overall study rating, and instead implement the domain-based approach of the Navigation Guide.26  However, if EPA continues to develop overall study ratings, the method for doing so must be stated in systematic review protocols prior to their application.   In addition, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation acknowledges that studies rated as uninformative may provide useful information (for example, in the quotation above); therefore, EPA should not use the term \u201cuninformative\u201d to describe relevant studies.    The TCEP systematic review protocol also fails to present a PECO statement for identifying relevant health hazard studies. A PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) statement provides criteria used to decide which studies are relevant to include in a systematic review and is a critical element of any systematic review protocol.27,28  EPA instead references the previous draft PECO statement for TCEP included in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.  Other elements of the hazard evidence identification process similarly reference the 2021 document, which is cited repeatedly in Section 5.5 \u201cEnvironmental and Human Health Hazard\u201d of the TCEP protocol. Similarly, as discussed above, the 2021 Draft TSCA Method is referenced for the approach to study quality evaluation. Each chemical-specific protocol should be a stand-alone document that  25 U.S. EPA (2023).

Dividing the methods across multiple documents increases the risk of mistakes and confusion in conducting the risk evaluation, and makes review of the risk evaluation challenging for peer reviewers and the public. As recommended by the SACC,29 EPA should develop a TSCA systematic review handbook that can be cited in future protocols for specific elements that do not vary across risk evaluations, but only a final handbook should be cited in protocols and not the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.    iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes.  As noted above, the TCEP-specific systematic review protocol issued in 2023 references the 2021 Draft TSCA Method concerning the PECO statement used for identification of evidence relevant to assessing TCEP\u2019s human health hazards. The protocol states:  During data screening, EPA followed the process described in Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft Systematic Review Protocol (U.S. EPA, 2021), to conduct TIAB and full-text screening for TCEP literature search results, as guided by the PECO statement. The same PECO statement was used during TIAB and full-text screening for references considered for the evaluation of environmental and human health hazard resulting from exposure to TCEP.30  (emphasis added)   This statement is unclear because Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method presents two different PECO statements:  one to be used for title-abstract screening (Table_Apx H-31) and a different PECO to be used for full text screening Table_Apx H-33). The 2023 TCEP systematic review protocol does not indicate which PECO statement has been used in conducting the TCEP risk evaluation. One important difference between the two versions of the PECO statement is in specifying the outcomes considered relevant. In Table_Apx H-31, outcomes are:  Human: All health outcomes (both cancer and non-cancer)  Animal and Plants: All biological effects (including bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured water and tissue concentrations).   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact effects.31  In Table_Apx H-33, important changes are made to the outcomes (additions are underlined, deletion shown in strikethough):   29 U.S. EPA (2022).

Draft Systematic Review Protocol Supporting TSCA Risk Evaluations for Chemical Substances Version 1.0, Table_Apx H-31. \n    \n 10 Human: All health outcomes (cancer and non-cancer) at the organ level or higher.  Animal and Plants: All apical biological effects (effects measured at the organ level or higher) and bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured media and/or tissue concentrations. Apical endpoints include but are not limited to reproduction, survival, and growth.   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact (irritation and sensitization) effects.  \u2022 Effects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.32    The PECO statement in Table_Apx H-33 incorporates several limitations on health effects studies that are considered by EPA to be relevant for hazard identification. For human studies, this second PECO statement specifies that only studies \u201cat the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. For animal studies, the second PECO statement specifies that only \u201capical\u201d effects \u201cmeasured at the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. The \u201cscreener note\u201d for this PECO deletes \u201ccellular\u201d from the list of relevant measurable biological effects and indicates that \u201cEffects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.\u201d33  EPA says in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation that the same PECO was used for title-abstract and full-text screening, but it never states which version of the PECO was used.  If EPA used the second version of the PECO (Table_Apx H-33) in conducting the risk evaluation, this would be contrary to the clear advice of the SACC, which said:   EPA should not limit PECO/RESO statements to apical endpoints but consider expanding outcomes to include known upstream markers of effect such as biochemical markers of effect or other outcomes at the cellular level.34   Public comments on the 2021 Draft TSCA Method also detail the many problems with restricting the included studies to only those with apical outcomes or effects at the organ level or higher.35 Inclusion of the PECO in the TCEP systematic review protocol would have avoided any confusion regarding which version of the PECO was applied. To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should specify which PECO statement was used in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and include that PECO statement in the chemical-specific systematic review protocol.  32 U.S. EPA (2021).

February 18, 2022.  EPA-HQ-OPPT-2021-0414-0015. https://www.regulations.gov/comment/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2021-0414-0015. \n    \n 11   iv. The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  EPA\u2019s use of unclear terminology for evidence synthesis and integration is an additional shortcoming of the TCEP systematic review protocol. The NASEM has recommended the use of the term \u201cevidence synthesis\u201d for assembling the evidence and drawing conclusions from a single evidence stream (e.g. toxicology, epidemiology), and \u201cevidence integration\u201d for the subsequent process of drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams.  The SACC review of EPA\u2019s 2021 Draft TSCA Method document reiterated this recommendation:  The EPA did not follow the recommendation of NASEM to separate evidence synthesis from evidence integration. To quote NASEM: \"Evidence synthesis deals with more homogeneous data within a single stream, and evidence integration deals with more heterogeneous data from multiple streams.\u201d36   The EPA could improve the clarify, transparency, and efficiency of its process by adopting the NASEM recommendation to use \u201csynthesis\u201d for drawing conclusions separately for each evidence stream (i.e., human, animal, and mechanistic evidence) and use \u2018integration\u2019 for drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams in combination \u2013 in context of the risk evaluation process/needs.37  In the TCEP systematic review protocol, however, EPA disregards the advice of both the NASEM and the SACC by continuing to use the term \u201cevidence integration\u201d for both steps.38 This is one more area in which EPA\u2019s approach differs from best practices in systematic review, violating TSCA. In addition, failing to adopt consistent and vetted terminology decreases the clarity of the risk evaluation and creates confusion for peer reviewers and the public regarding the procedures applied to drawing conclusions from a single stream of evidence.   v.  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    EPA has made some improvements in its approach to  systematic review under TSCA, particularly regarding the discontinuation of its quantitative approach to study quality evaluation. However, EPA has not indicated if these improvements, including changes to study quality evaluation, will be applied in all future TSCA risk evaluations.  EPA has instead stated that systematic review methods may vary across TSCA assessments.  In doing so, EPA has failed to  36 U.S. EPA (2022).

To adhere to best practices in systematic review, including those recommended by the NASEM and SACC, EPA should issue a new TSCA systematic review methodology document that states methods to be applied consistently to all TSCA rulemakings, which must include applying only qualitative methods for study quality evaluation.  EPA should also prepare a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for each TSCA risk evaluation it conducts, and these protocols should be complete, stand-alone documents that do not refer to the 2021 Draft TSCA Method for critical elements, such as PECO statements and methods for study quality evaluation.  The chemical-specific protocols for ongoing and future risk evaluations should also be released for public comment well before the draft risk evaluations are completed to allow for public input, scrutiny, and opportunities for improvement. We urge EPA to consistently adopt the practices of the IRIS program for systematic review protocol development and publication across all EPA programs and offices.     2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard assessment.  a.  EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation continues to rely on the scientifically-deficient methods for non-cancer dose-response analysis and risk characterization employed in previous TSCA risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s methods for non-cancer risk evaluation do not provide a quantitative estimate of risk. Instead, they rely on calculation of a margin of exposure (\u201cMOE\u201d), defined as:  Margin of Exposure = Non-cancer point of departure / Human exposure.39  The MOE approach is a scientifically inappropriate approach for characterizing risk and is inconsistent with amended TSCA\u2019s requirements to use the \u201cbest available science\u201d and to ensure protection of \u201cpotentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations\u201d (\u201cPESS\u201d).40 Use of the MOE, which relies on a point of departure (\u201cPOD\u201d) with no extrapolation to lower doses, is a simplistic approach that only examines the ratio of the POD to the exposure level and determines whether this ratio \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d or if \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d41 The MOE does not estimate the proportion of the exposed population projected to experience a specified health endpoint or the number of individuals affected, and it perpetuates the scientifically flawed notion that a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cno risk\u201d level of  39 U.S. EPA (2023).

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 13 chemical exposure can be identified for a diverse exposed population.42,43 The National Academies44 and the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d)45 have outlined more robust methods for risk estimation that more accurately account for variability and vulnerability across the human population and have been demonstrated in published case studies.46,47,48,49   We applied the WHO methodology to estimate risks of adverse effects from chronic inhalation and oral exposure to TCEP using EPA\u2019s identification of hazards and estimation of points of departure (PODs).  Specifically, we estimated risks of male reproductive effects (decreased numbers of seminiferous tubules), using EPA\u2019s POD of 2.73 mg/kg-d for oral exposure and 14.9 mg/m3 for inhalation exposure.50  The PODs are drawn from a 35-day study in mice.  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characterization (i.e. selection of a \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d) included an interspecies adjustment factor and a human variability adjustment factor, but inappropriately omitted an adjustment factor accounting for the subchronic duration of the mouse study.  Our application of the WHO methodology includes an adjustment for study duration along with the interspecies and human variability adjustments.   In applying the WHO methodology (see Technical Appendix for details) to risks of adverse male reproductive effects from oral exposure to TCEP, we found that: \u2022 0.06 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 1% of the population, \u2022 0.02 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.1% of the population, \u2022 0.008 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for oral exposure to TCEP uses 2.73 mg/kg-d as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.51 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d52 for any chronic exposure less than 2.73 mg/kg-d / 30 = 0.09 mg/kg-d. By applying the WHO methodology, we found that the upper bound risk at an exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. This risk level is  42 Woodruff, T. J., Rayasam, S. D. G., Axelrad, D.

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 14 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (see below).  Following EPA\u2019s approach for extrapolating from oral exposures to inhalation exposures, the above values can be expressed as inhalation exposures in mg/m3 by multiplying by 5.44.53  For example, the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population is 0.008 x 5.44 = 0.04 mg/m3.  EPA must incorporate this approach to non-cancer dose-response and risk characterization in the final TCEP risk evaluation.  Our analysis demonstrated that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of any exposures less than those producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40,  a risk level that is unacceptably high, even by EPA\u2019s own standards;  EPA typically applies a target range of protection for carcinogenic risks of 1-in-10,000 (10-4) to 1-in-1,000,000 (10-6).54 To offer the strongest public health protections, EPA should target any upper bound risks of non-cancer effects from TCEP exposure to be no more than 1-in-1,000,000 risk level. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed.  EPA has appropriately modeled cancer dose-response as a linear relationship with no threshold, consistent with EPA\u2019s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment for a carcinogen without an identified mode of action (MOA).  However, EPA  incorrectly states  that because TCEP does not act through a known mutagenic MOA, there is a threshold below which there is no cancer risk:  Because direct mutagenicity is not likely to be the predominant MOA, using linear low dose extrapolation is a health conservative analysis that would overpredict risks assuming that TCEP acts via a threshold MOA.55 (emphasis added)  Assuming all TCEP exposure is associated with some risk is likely to be health conservative because EPA does not believe that a mutagenic MOA is likely for TCEP and a threshold below which cancer does not occur is expected to exist. However, information is lacking with which to determine an appropriate threshold.56 (emphasis added)  EPA provides no evidence to support its speculation that there is a threshold for TCEP\u2019s cancer risk.  The absence of a known mutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other MOAs can operate with no threshold.  Further, the NASEM states that human variability, exposure to other chemicals, and background disease processes alone can result in linear dose-response relationships at low doses, regardless of whether mutagenic MOAs are known:   53 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 54 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. 55 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 291. 56 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 334 (repeated on page 418). \n    \n 15 Background exposures and underlying disease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population doses of concern.57  The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for mechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose-response relationship can be linear at a low dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to background processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a baseline level of dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the background process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That may be difficult to measure because of background noise in the system but may be addressed through dose-response modeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic cancer mechanism can result in linear dose-response relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, nonlinear dose-response processes\u2014for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor surveillance, DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles\u2014may be found to cause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background processes, given cancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures and high variability in human susceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low-dose linear dose-response relationships in the human population.58  To adhere to best practices in risk characterization, EPA must remove the statements quoted above regarding a cancer threshold for TCEP from the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation before it is finalized.    c. EPA incorrectly failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects.  EPA omitted critical uncertainty factors (UFs) when characterizing non-cancer risk in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, violating TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. To estimate the non-cancer risks of TCEP, EPA used data from a 35-day mouse study (Chen et al. 2015)59 to derive a POD for male reproductive effects (decreased number of and degeneration of seminiferous tubules), and employed the \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d bright-line approach to determine whether a chronic exposure is sufficiently below the POD.  To calculate the benchmark MOE for risk characterization using the Chen et al. POD, EPA applied an interspecies uncertainty factor (UF) of 3 to account for uncertainties related to any animal-to-human differences remaining after calculation of a human equivalent concentration, and an intraspecies UF of 10 to account for uncertainties around human variability, for an overall UF of 30 (10 x 3).  Thus, according to EPA, any exposure less than 30-fold lower than the POD \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d and for exposures more than 30-fold lower \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d60   57 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 8. 58 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, pp. 129-130. 59 Chen, G; Jin, Y; Wu, Y; Liu, L; Fu, Z. (2015). Exposure of male mice to two kinds of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) induced oxidative stress and endocrine disruption. Environ Toxicol Pharmacol 40: 310-318.  60 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 16 The section of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation on determination of the benchmark MOE makes no mention of the subchronic-to-chronic study duration UF that is usually applied to account for the lower dose that may produce the same effect if a chronic study were conducted.  Inclusion of a subchronic UF would increase the benchmark MOE and in turn lower EPA\u2019s bright line for identifying risks of concern by a factor of 3 to 10.  Failure to increase the benchmark MOE applied to the POD for male reproductive effects from Chen et al. with a subchronic UF therefore results in significant underestimation of risk, potentially by up to an order of magnitude.  The risk evaluation acknowledges the uncertainty in using a POD from a subchronic study:  it is uncertain whether the POD would be lower if Chen et al. (2015a) extended the exposure duration.61  Using Chen et al. (2015a) to represent chronic exposure durations adds uncertainty to the risk evaluation. If the specific effect identified by Chen et al. (2015a) were measured in a chronic study in the same species starting in adolescence, the POD could be more sensitive. Therefore, it is possible that risks might be under-predicted.62  However, the risk evaluation lacks any discussion of the possible use of a subchronic UF to address that uncertainty.  As discussed above, EPA must use probabilistic methods, including adjustment for the subchronic study duration, for dose-response assessment and risk characterization of non-cancer effects.    3.  EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.  In the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA identifies the following groups as PESS:  infants exposed through human milk from exposed individuals, children and male adolescents who use consumer articles or are among the exposed general population, subsistence fishers, tribal populations, pregnant women, workers and consumers who experience aggregated or sentinel exposures, fenceline communities who live near facilities that emit TCEP, and firefighters.63  Identification of PESS for each chemical assessed is a critical aspect of conducting risk evaluation under TSCA, and TSCA requires EPA to  determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.64    61 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 283. 62 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 290. 63 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 329. 64 15 USC \u00a72605(b)(4)(A). \n    \n 17 In the final 2017 TSCA Risk Evaluation Framework Rule, EPA defined PESS (using the statutory definition) as:  a group of individuals within the general population identified by the Administrator who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.65   To date, EPA has not employed a consistent or structured approach to identifying PESS in its TSCA risk evaluations, including scope documents for ongoing risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s approach and terminology for identifying PESS varied considerably in the first 10 risk evaluations. Among the inconsistencies were differences in whether health conditions related to a chemical\u2019s hazards were considered and whether fenceline communities were included.66,67 For example, fenceline communities were identified as PESS for hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), but not for 1,4-dioxane, 1-bromopropane (1-BP), or C.I. Pigment Violet 29 (PV-29); children were identified as PESS for 1-BP and HBCD, but not for 1,4-dioxane or PV-29.68 To remedy the problem of inconsistent and incomplete identification of PESS, Rayasam et al. recommended that:  EPA should prepare a comprehensive methodology to identify PESS and quantify their risks consistently within and across the TSCA risk evaluations.69  EPA has not yet proposed such a methodology. The consideration of PESS in Table 5-69 and Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is a useful initial step towards developing a consistent, structured approach to identifying PESS in TSCA risk evaluations. The table gives explicit consideration to each of the following factors that may lead to increased chemical exposures or susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures: lifestage, pre-existing disease, lifestyle activities, occupational and consumer exposures, socio-demographic factors, nutrition, genetics/epigenetics, unique activities, aggregate exposures, and other chemical and non-chemical stressors.  EPA, however, has violated TSCA\u2019s mandate to consider each of the relevant factors in identifying populations groups that \u201cdue to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects.\u201d70  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:   65 U.S. EPA (2017).

The effect of these factors on susceptibility to health effects of TCEP is not known; therefore, EPA is uncertain about the magnitude of any possible increased risk from effects associated with TCEP exposure.71  EPA\u2019s default approach seems to be that a susceptible subgroup will not be identified as PESS when there are not chemical-specific quantitative data on the magnitude of increased susceptibility for a given susceptibility factor.  TSCA does not require chemical-specific quantitative data to identify or evaluate risk to PESS; TSCA simply requires EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d when evaluating risk to PESS. The best available science demonstrates that both intrinsic factors, which include biological traits like age, genetic makeup, and pre-existing health conditions, and extrinsic factors, which include psychosocial stress from experiencing income inequality, violence, racism, healthcare inequity, or food insecurity, can individually or collectively increase susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures.72 EPA should therefore focus first on identifying susceptible subpopulations based on either chemical-specific evidence or the broader literature on intrinsic and extrinsic susceptibility factors, and then, as a separate step, consider how to account for the elevated risks for each group.  The initial identification of PESS, however, should not be contingent on chemical-specific data to quantify risk for a susceptible subgroup.  Once the appropriate groups are identified as PESS, EPA should then consider the availability of chemical -specific data. When such data are absent, the application of generic adjustment factors (beyond the customary 10x factor for human variability) should be applied to ensure that risks to PESS are not underestimated.73  Lifestage. EPA has appropriately identified infants (exposed from human breast milk), children, male adolescents and pregnant women as PESS. However, infants as PESS should not be restricted to human breast milk exposure, as infants are also likely to be exposed to TCEP via ingestion of household dust (e.g. hand to mouth behaviors). In addition, EPA\u2019s risk evaluation understates the magnitude of human breast milk exposures for some infants by assuming a maximum breastfeeding duration of one year. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) indicate that 37.6 percent of infants born in 2020 were breastfeeding at age 12 months, and 17.3 percent were breastfeeding at age 18 months.74  71 U.S. EPA (2023).

Enhanced susceptibility of infants, children, women of reproductive age and people of age 65 years or older is well-established, and these groups should be identified as PESS for each TSCA risk evaluation, regardless of whether there are chemical-specific data to quantify those differences. Further, EPA makes no adjustments to quantify the enhanced risks to the susceptible lifestages. Instead, EPA applies the customary 10x human variability factor, which is routinely applied in EPA risk assessments and is not sufficient to address human variability in response to chemical exposures.75 EPA acknowledges that \u201cThe magnitude of differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics for some individuals may be greater than accounted for by the UFH of 10,\u201d76 but it then continues to apply this insufficient value. The WHO\u2019s International Programme on Chemical Safety (\u201cIPCS\u201d) found that an adjustment factor of approximately 42X is needed to account for the range in human variability in response to chemical exposure when estimating a risk-specific dose intended for a risk of 1% (1-in-100), with larger factors necessary for protection of the population at lower risk levels.77    Pre-existing disease. EPA did not identify any groups as PESS based on pre-existing disease or health conditions. EPA identified neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and kidney toxicity as likely hazards of TCEP, but it disregarded the prevalence in the U.S. population of vulnerabilities to these hazards. For example, the CDC estimates that 14% of U.S. adults have chronic kidney disease; this affects not just older adults, but also 6% of adults ages 18-44 years.78  Given that kidney toxicity is a hazard of TCEP, people with chronic kidney disease should be considered a susceptible subpopulation in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Risk estimation for this group should also incorporate an adjustment factor (in addition to the customary human variability factor) representing the enhanced risk of kidney effects from TCEP exposure. Similarly, population groups with biological susceptibility to the neurotoxic, reproductive and/or developmental effects of TCEP should also be considered PESS, and appropriate adjustments to the estimation of risks of each outcome for these groups should be made.  Individual activities. Subsistence fishers (including tribal populations) are identified as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation based on elevated TCEP exposures. However, no \u201clifestyle\u201d or \u201cindividual\u201d activities are identified for enhanced susceptibility. EPA mentions smoking as a lifestyle factor that could influence susceptibility to chemical exposures, but it failed to identify smokers as PESS because it found no chemical-specific information. Smoking tobacco has numerous biological effects that could enhance susceptibility to the hazards of TCEP, such as adverse effects on the kidney. Smokers should be considered PESS even if there is not direct TCEP-specific evidence. In addition, we recommend using the term \u201cindividual activities\u201d instead of \u201clifestyle activities.\u201d   75 Julia R.

EPA appropriately identified firefighters as an occupational group with elevated TCEP exposures. However, in discussing the relevant evidence, EPA omitted the important 2022 study by Trowbridge et al.79  EPA also failed to consider firefighter exposures in its unreasonable risk determination for TCEP. According to Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, firefighter exposures are classified as \u201cbackground\u201d and \u201cEPA did not identify sources of increased COU or pathway specific exposure for firefighters.\u201d80 However, it is highly likely that elevated firefighter exposures arise from the presence of consumer and commercial products containing TCEP in burning structures, and firefighter exposures should be a consideration in EPA\u2019s unreasonable risk determinations for those products. In addition, EPA failed to consider that workers may be occupationally exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse outcomes with TCEP (e.g. neurological, reproductive and kidney effects).  People who experience occupational exposures to other toxic chemicals that are linked to similar adverse health outcomes as TCEP can have enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of TCEP and should be identified and evaluated as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Geographic factors.  Geographic factors were not included in Table 5-69 of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. However, EPA has considered geographic factors as contributors to PESS in previous assessments and appropriately identified fenceline communities near facilities that emit TCEP as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, so it is unclear why an entry for this factor is omitted from Table 5-69. Although EPA has estimated exposures to fenceline communities, it has not considered the many characteristics that can enhance susceptibility to the effects of TCEP and are common in fenceline communities. In general, people living in fenceline communities are more likely to be people of color and are more likely to experience increased exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors that make them more susceptible to harm, including a broad range of non-chemical stressors like pre-existing disease, racism, and poverty.81 EPA is therefore required under TSCA to account for these enhanced susceptibilities when evaluating risks to fenceline communities.  Socio-demographic factors. The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says \u201cEPA did not evaluate exposure differences between racial groups.\u201d82  At a minimum, EPA should assess the demographic profile of populations living in locations likely to experience elevated exposures (e.g. sites with TCEP in groundwater, sites near facilities producing, using, or disposing of TCEP).  EPA conducted such an analysis for the proposed TSCA risk management rule for trichloroethylene,83 and this approach should be incorporated in all TSCA risk evaluations.  If EPA does not have the data necessary to conduct a robust, accurate, and scientifically-sound environmental justice analysis of chemicals subject to TSCA risk evaluation, it should develop and execute a strategy for obtaining the data and analyzing it.  For example, EPA could use its TSCA authorities to gather information from industry on TCEP manufacturing/processing sites and products containing TCEP. EPA failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release  79 Trowbridge J, Gerona R, McMaster M, Ona K, Clarity C, Bessonneau V , Rudel R, Buren H, Morello-Frosch R (2022).

The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:  EPA did not identify specific evidence that sociodemographic factors influence susceptibility to TCEP although it is known that they can affect susceptibility to disease.84     TSCA requires EPA to account for enhanced susceptibility to chemical exposures in chemical risk evaluations.  EPA must account for socio-demographic factors associated with enhanced susceptibility in its identification of PESS and in analyzing risks to those groups.  For example, people experiencing poverty or racial discrimination may experience psychosocial stress85,86,87,88,89 that can enhance susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Nutrition. EPA correctly states that \u201cNutrition can affect susceptibility to disease generally,\u201d but it did not identify any PESS because it \u201cdid not identify specific evidence that nutritional factors influence susceptibility to TCEP.\u201d90  People with food insecurity or lack of access to nutritious food can experience enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals, including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Genetics.  EPA states that \u201cgenetic disorders may increase susceptibility to male reproductive effects; this was addressed through a 10\u00d7 UF for human variability.\u201d91  EPA assumes that a 10-fold factor is sufficient to account for human variability in response to chemical exposures, including the impacts of genetics and all the other susceptibility factors in the table, even though the National Academies92 and the WHO93 have both compiled evidence that a larger factor is necessary to ensure public health protection. EPA must accordingly increase the uncertainty factor it uses to account for enhanced susceptibility to TCEP based on genetic disorders.  Aggregate exposures. EPA has only partially accounted for aggregate exposure in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. EPA aggregated across exposure pathways for consumers and separately for workers, but it did not aggregate exposures for workers who also experience consumer and general population exposures, and did not aggregate exposures for consumers who have  84 U.S. EPA (2023).

EPA says that these exposures were not aggregated because it did not have data indicating such co-exposures. EPA should not require chemical-specific evidence to conduct aggregate exposure evidence. It can reasonably model scenarios in which exposures are combined across products and across worker, consumer and general population exposures. For example, some individuals with occupational exposure to TCEP are likely to live close to where they work and would therefore also be exposed as members of the general population.  Other chemical and non-chemical stressors. EPA\u2019s approach to consideration of other stressors in identifying PESS and accounting for risks to PESS is too narrow. EPA mentions experimental findings of benzo-a-pyrene interactions with TCEP, but does not specifically identify persons with exposure to benzo-a-pyrene as PESS and makes no effort to account for the elevated risks arising from those exposures. Further, EPA does not give any consideration to other chemical stressors that share common adverse outcomes with TCEP.  For example, the draft risk evaluation identifies \u201cdifferences in numbers and degeneration of seminiferous tubules\u201d as the \u201cMost Critical Endpoint\u201d among TCEP non-cancer effects.94 EPA\u2019s 2023 draft document on application of cumulative risk assessment to phthalates under TSCA discusses the extensive experimental evidence of seminiferous tubule atrophy/degeneration from phthalate exposure and finds that it is \u201ca sensitive, adverse effect frequently reported by board certified pathologists.\u201d95     EPA should consider males who experienced prenatal exposure to phthalates as a PESS for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation to recognize that pre-existing damage to the seminiferous tubules that may have occurred from phthalate exposure would make males more vulnerable to further harm from TCEP exposure. The consequence of early-life phthalate exposure would be that the risks of male reproductive harm would occur at lower TCEP doses than EPA has estimated in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and an adjustment factor should be incorporated to account for that increased vulnerability to damage of the seminiferous tubules. In addition, TCEP and phthalates can be used together in polyvinyl chloride,96 further supporting the joint consideration of TCEP and phthalates under TSCA. Direct experimental evidence of joint action of phthalates and TCEP is not necessary; the joint action can be inferred from the evidence of a common adverse outcome. Populations exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse effects with TCEP should similarly be identified as PESS.    EPA should expand its identification of PESS based on the factors described above and should expand on the approach of Table 5-69 and Appendix D to develop a comprehensive, consistent, and structured methodology for identifying PESS in all TSCA risk evaluations.         94 U.S. EPA (2023).

For risk characteriza?on of non-cancer health e\ufb00ects, the TSCA risk evalua?on calculates a \u201cmargin of exposure\u201d (MOE) for each exposure scenario, which is the ra?o of the point of departure (POD) to the exposure level.  For the TCEP male reproduc?ve e\ufb00ects, the TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on concludes that an MOE of 30 or more indicates that \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d97  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characteriza?on does not actually es?mate risks of adverse e\ufb00ects in the popula?on with chronic exposure to TCEP, but instead simply applies a \u201cbright line\u201d judgment of whether or not the MOE is adequate.  A more informa?ve approach for both risk characteriza?on and risk management would be to apply the probabilis?c dose-response assessment methods of the Interna?onal Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS),98 part of the World Health Organiza?on (WHO), to es?mate the risk of adverse e\ufb00ects at various levels of exposure.  The IPCS methodology has previously been described and applied in several peer-reviewed journal ar?cles.99,100,101,102,103    We applied the IPCS approach for \u201cquantal-determinis?c\u201d endpoints and the \u201capproximate probabilis?c\u201d calcula?on (see IPCS report Fig 3.5, panel C)104 to es?mate risks of reduced numbers of seminiferous tubules from chronic oral and inhala?on exposure to TCEP .  The analysis involved the following steps: 1. Derivation of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments 2. Application of study duration adjustments 3. Application of interspecies adjustments 4. Application of intraspecies adjustments 5. Calculation of HDMI - the human dose (HD) of TCEP associated with a particular magnitude of effect M at a particular population incidence I.   For each aspect of the analysis, including the values used to derive the IPCS POD and the adjustment factors applied to derive the HDMI, the IPCS methodology uses a 50th percen?le value (P50) as a central es?mate and the ra?o of 95th percen?le to 50th percen?le (P95/P50) as a measure of uncertainty.  All POD and HDMI values presented in this analysis are for con?nuous exposures.  We demonstrate each of these steps star?ng with the EPA oral exposure POD to derive a set of oral HDMI values for di\ufb00erent levels of popula?on incidence, then discuss deriva?on of a corresponding set of inhala?on exposure HDMI values.    97 U.S. EPA (2023).

Guidance document on evaluating and expressing uncertainty in hazard characterization, 2nd edition. \n    \n 24  STEP 1:  Deriva?on of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments  The IPCS methodology requires the use of an ED50 (median e\ufb00ec?ve dose) value as the POD for quantal-determinis?c endpoints.  Since an ED50 is not available from the EPA risk evalua?on, we began with EPA\u2019s benchmark dose, lower con\ufb01dence limit (BMDL) and applied adjustments provided by the IPCS methodology.  At the same ?me, we incorporated quan?ta?ve uncertain?es for each of these adjustments.  EPA used a benchmark response (BMR) of 5% to derive the BMDL for decreased numbers of  seminiferous tubules from TCEP exposure.  The chronic oral non-cancer BMDL05 value expressed as a human equivalent dose (HED) is 2.73 mg/kg-d.105      The \ufb01rst POD adjustment in the IPCS methodology is to convert the BMDL05 to a BMD05 as follows:  BMD05(HED) = BMDL05(HED) x (BMD05 / BMDL05)  This adjustment is used because the Dra) TCEP Risk Evalua1on does not report the BMD05 as an HED.  However, both the BMD05 and BMDL05 are available in terms of the animal dosage, before deriva?on of the HED, and can be used for computa?on of the BMD05 / BMDL05 ra?o.  The necessary values for this ra?o were obtained from EPA\u2019s supplemental \ufb01le of BMD modeling results,106 and the ra?o calculated as follows:    BMD05 / BMDL05 = 28.8 / 20.8 = 1.38  The BMD05(HED) is then:  BMD05(HED) = 2.73 mg/kg-d x 1.38 = 3.77 mg/kg-d  In the IPCS methodology, uncertainty in the BMD is represented by the P95/P50 ra?o, which is equal to the same ra?o of BMD / BMDL, or 1.38.    The second POD adjustment is to convert from the BMD to an ED50.  The ED50 and its uncertainty are determined by applying the following conversion from Chiu et al. 2018:  \u201cif ED50 not reported: BMD at the reported BMR is mul?plied by an addi?onal factor of 3.0; addi?onal uncertainty through adding 1.52 to (P95/P50)2.\u201d107  The median (P50) es?mate of the ED50 is then derived by mul?plying the BMDL05(HED) by the two adjustment factors (P50).  The uncertainty adjustments (P95/P50) for each POD aspect are combined into a composite P95/P50 value.  In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template, those values are entered as follows:    105 U.S. EPA (2023).

Since the determination of the EPA BMDL05 values incorporate dosimetric adjustments, no further adjustment for body size is necessary (P50 = 1).  The uncertainty in the bodyweight scaling is not quantified in this analysis (P95/P50 = 1).    For the TK/TD di\ufb00erences remaining afer bodyweight scaling, the IPCS report recommends a central es?mate (P50) of 1 (i.e., no addi?onal interspecies di\ufb00erences) and represen?ng uncertainty with a P95/P50 factor of 3.112  We incorporated these IPCS recommenda?ons, which are entered In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template as follows:  Interspecies adjustments (AFInterspecies) for probabilisDc  dose-response analysis of chronic TCEP exposure Aspect P50 P95/P50 AFInterspecies-BS 1 1 AFInterspecies-TK/TD 1 3  Step 4:  Applica?on of intraspecies (human variability) adjustments   In the IPCS methodology, the value of the human variability adjustment factor (AFintraspecies) varies depending on the incidence of the adverse e\ufb00ect in the exposed popula?on \u2013 with a larger adjustment factor necessary to extrapolate from the POD to lower levels of incidence.  The IPCS report provides AFintraspecies for several incidence (I) values.

The corresponding values for inhala?on exposure can be derived in two ways, which each provide the same results: 1. Multiply oral HDMI values by a factor of 5.44 mg/m3 per mg/kg-d.  This factor is obtained from information provided in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.113 2. Replace EPA\u2019s oral BMDL05 (2.73 mg/kg-d) in the above tables with EPA\u2019s inhalation BMDL05 (14.9 mg/m3) and recalculate the ED50 and the HDMI values using the same adjustments.   The National Academies and the WHO/IPCS have both recommended using the lower confidence limit (LCL) on a probabilistic dose-response distribution for use in decision-making, in place of a traditional reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC). The National Academies said in Science and Decisions that:  multiple risk-specific doses could be provided\u2026in the various risk characterizations that EPA produces to aid environmental decision-making.114    113 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 114 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 140. \n    \n 34 A Risk-Specific Reference Dose: For quantal effects, the RfD can be defined to be the dose that corresponds to a particular risk specified to be de minimis (for example, 1 in 100,000) at a defined confidence level (for example, 95%) for the toxicity end point of concern.115  The WHO/IPCS said:   the LCL of the HDMI can be used as a probabilis?c RfD to replace the determinis?c RfD. In this case, the probabilis?c RfD is the dose that protects the popula?on from a speci\ufb01ed magnitude and incidence of e\ufb00ect with a pre-speci\ufb01ed per cent coverage (con\ufb01dence).116  Consistent with the guidance from the Na?onal Academies and the IPCS, we summarize the above results in the following table of the lower con\ufb01dence limit (5th percen?le or P05) risk-speci\ufb01c doses (HDMI) for mul?ple levels of risk (incidence or I), for both oral and inhala?on exposures.

Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an oral exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for inhalation exposure to TCEP uses 14.9 mg/m3 as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.119 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d120 for any chronic inhalation exposure less than 14.9 mg/m3 / 30 = 0.50 mg/m3. Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an inhalation exposure of 0.50 mg/m3 is 2.5%, or 1-in-40.  The es?mates of HDMI presented here were based en?rely on input values and equa?ons available from the WHO/IPCS methodology document and from EPA\u2019s TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on.  An important caveat to these calcula?ons is that the values used to represent human variability may be understated.  The IPCS default human variability distribu?on is based on 37 data sets for human toxicokine?c variability and 34 data sets for human toxicodynamic variability.   Most of these data sets were obtained from controlled human exposure studies of pharmaceu?cals conducted in small samples of healthy adults, represen?ng considerably less variability than found in the general popula?on.121,122,123 If human variability is underes?mated, then the actual dose associated with each incidence level (e.g. I =1%, I = 0.1%) will be lower than the values obtained from this analysis \u2013 or in other words, risk at each dose will be underes?mated.       \n 117 U.S. EPA (2023).

TCEP is found in fu rniture and textiles, insulation and flooring, \nbaby carriers and car seats, and other widely us ed products. It contamin ates indoor and outdoor \nair, drinking water supplies, and fish and wildli fe. When materials containing TCEP are disposed \nof or recycled, TCEP\u2014and sometimes other high ly toxic byproducts\u2014are released from waste \nincinerators, recycling fa cilities, and landfills and can leach out of recycled-content products.   \nTSCA requires EPA to comprehensively evalua te TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks, including \nrisks to subpopulations who expe rience greater risk than the ge neral population because they \nhave greater exposures or are more  susceptible to harm from TCEP.2  Where, as here, EPA finds \nunreasonable risk, it must regulate the chemical \u201ct o the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents such risk.\u201d3 The draft risk evaluation, while co rrectly finding that TCEP presents \nunreasonable risk to human health and the environment, fails to consider the full ex tent of those \nrisks and deprives EPA of the information it need s to ensure the protection of public health and \nthe environment. \n1 EPA, EPA-740-D-23-002, Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris (2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP)   \n(Dec. 2023) (\u201cDraft TCEP Risk Evaluation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n12/tcep_draft_risk_evalua tion_20231207_hero_pub lic-release.pdf.  \n2 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A) (requiring EPA to evalua te chemicals\u2019 risks to  \u201cpotentially exposed \nor susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d); id. \u00a7 2602(12) (defining \u201cpotential ly exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d). \n3 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). EXHIBIT F\n2 First, despite EPA\u2019s mandate to conduct ri sk evaluations using the \u201cbest available \nscience,\u201d4 EPA disregards the broad scientific consensus that flame retardants like TCEP should \nbe evaluated and regulated as a class, as expr essly authorized by TSCA . While other agencies, \nstates, and scientific bodies ar e actively pursuing that recommended class-based approach, EPA \nevaluates TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks in isol ation, understating the ch emical\u2019s real-world \nimpacts and inviting the substitution of one  toxic flame retardant for another.   \nSecond, EPA unlawfully excludes multiple conditions of use from its TCEP risk \ndetermination, claiming that it lacks the info rmation needed to evaluate them. But TSCA \nrequires EPA to assess the risks a ssociated with all of a chemical\u2019s conditions of use and to \ncollect or generate the information it needs to do so. Here, not only has EPA failed to use \nTSCA\u2019s information collection auth orities to fill asserted data gaps, it also denied a petition \nseeking additional testing of TCEP  by asserting that such testi ng was not necessary and that EPA \ncould evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks adequately using existing data and models . Most problematically, \nEPA fails to use reasonably available informatio n to calculate the full risks from TCEP disposal, \none of the chemical\u2019s most sign ificant conditions of use.   \nThird, for the conditions of use that it does consider, EPA repeated ly understates TCEP\u2019s \nexposures and risks. EPA relies on unsupported assu mptions about exposure  rates and durations, \nignores the impact of background exposures to TCEP, improperly discounts the studies that \ndemonstrate the greatest hazards, and disreg ards its own guidance concerning the use of \nuncertainty factors. Compounding those flaws, EPA violates TS CA\u2019s mandate to evaluate \nTCEP\u2019s risks to potentially e xposed or susceptible subpopulat ions, including people who are \nexposed to TCEP from multiple conditions of us e and exposure pathways and routes, or who are \nmore susceptible to harm because of their exposures to multiple flame retardants that can \nexacerbate the risks from TCEP. EPA also undere stimates risks to tr ibal populations who \nexperience increased TCEP exposures not only fro m the consumption of contaminated fish but \nalso from other subsistence foods and from heig htened exposure associ ated with inadequate \nwaste management infrastructure  and open burning of solid wast e, among other pathways. EPA \nsubstantially understates TC EP\u2019s risks to wildlife and fails to consider the chemical\u2019s effects on \nthreatened and endangered species and other sp ecies of special conser vation concern. Finally, \nEPA relies on vague and underprotective unreasonable risk thresholds that  would leave workers, \nconsumers, and fenceline communities exposed to unacceptable harm.   \nWe acknowledge and appreciate the work that went into EPA\u2019s draft risk evaluation, \nwhich does improve on prior risk ev aluations in several respects. EPA correctly identifies tribal \npopulations as a potentially expos ed or susceptible subpopulati on, recognizes the increased \nexposures and risks tribal popula tions often face from fish consumption, and calculates those \ndietary exposures using bot h contemporary and heritage tribal fish consumption rates. EPA also \nconsiders aggregate risks to certain populations  who are exposed from multiple exposure routes, \na legally required analysis that EPA has negl ected in the past. But EPA cannot adequately \nevaluate the risks associat ed with TCEP, or protect the people who are exposed to it, if it persists \nin ignoring 30 percent of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e and systematically un derstates the risks from \n4 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n3 the other 70 percent. TSCA require s EPA to evaluate the risks fro m all of TCEP\u2019s conditions of \nuse, to all potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations, so EPA has the information it needs \nto fully eliminate TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. We urge EPA to revise its risk evaluation, as set \nforth in greater detail below, so it compli es with those statut ory requirements.   \nI. EPA Cannot Meaningfully Evaluate or Su ccessfully Regulate Individual Flame\nRetardants in Isolation\nOrganohalogen flame retardants (\u201cOFRs\u201d), in cluding TCEP, are added to furniture and\ntextiles, furniture foam and vehicle cushioning, building and construction materials, and a broad \nrange of other products.5 Because they are \u201cmixed into but not chemically bonded to materials, \n[they] can leach out of products\u201d and into people, wildlife, and the environment.6 Ninety-seven \npercent of people in the Unite d States have at least one flame retardant in their blood,7 and 75 \npercent of people tested in one study had a TCEP metabolite in their urine.8   \nPeople are routinely exposed to, and harm ed by, combinations of OFRs in their \nworkplaces, homes, and communities. Multiple fl ame retardants, including TCEP, have been \ndetected in household dust,9 college dormitories,10 daycare centers and nurseries,11 and a range of \nwildlife species.12 Multiple OFRs, including TCEP, are also associated with an increased risk of \ncancer, reproductive harm, and othe r overlapping health effects.13 Evaluating the individual \n5 See, e.g.,  Joseph A.

In the 1970s and 1980s, polyc hlorinated biphenyls \n(\u201cPCBs\u201d) and polybrominated biphenyls (\u201cPBBs\u201d) were widely used as flame retardants until \nthey were found to cause cancer and other severe environmental and health impacts.15 The \nregulation of PCB and PBB flame retardants resulted in the in creased use of polybrominated \ndiphenyl ethers (\u201cPBDEs\u201d), which were later fo und to cause reproductive , developmental, and \nneurodevelopmental harm.16 Even within the PBDE subcla ss, chemical manufacturers often \nresponded to regulation of a particular chemic al by making minor chan ges to its underlying \nchemistry and replacing it with a closel y related, similarly toxic substitute.17 As phaseouts of \nPBDEs began in the 1990s, industry turned to harmful organophosphate ester flame retardants \nlike TCEP, tripentyl phosphate (\u201cTPP\u201d), a nd tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (\u201cTDBPP\u201d).18  \nEven now, as production of TCEP has decrease d in recent years, other organophosphate ester \nflame retardants like 2-Propanol, 1-chloro-,  2,2\u2019,2\u2019\u2019-phosphate (\u201cTCPP\u201d) and 2-Propanol, 1,3-\ndichloro-, phosphate (3:1) (\u201cTDCPP\u201d ) have emerged as replacements.19 As the United Nations \n \nConsumer Product Safety Commission (Sept. 14, 2014), \nhttps://greenscience policy.org/docs/eastmond-cpsc- supporting-materials-14-09-15.pdf .  \n14 See infra Point VI.B. \n15 Barbara Hales & Shirra Freeman, Nat\u2019l Collaborating Ctr. for Env\u2019t Health, Regrettable \nReplacements: The Case of Chemical Flame Retardants  (July 8, 2020), \nhttps://ncceh.ca/resources/evidence-briefs/reg rettable-replacements -case-chemical-flame-\nretardants . \n16 Id.; Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (\u201cATSDR\u201d), Toxicological Profile for \nPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs)  11\u201326 (Mar. 2017) (\u201cTox Profile for PBDEs\u201d), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp207.pdf . \n17 Martin Sharkey et al., Phasing-Out of Legacy Brominated Flame Retardants: The UNEP \nStockholm Convention and Other Legislative Action Worldwide , 144 Env\u2019t Int\u2019l 106041, at *3 \n(2020) (\u201cPenta- and Octa- BDE commercial mixtures were liste d in the Stockholm Convention \nin 2004, while Deca-BDE\u2014used as a replacem ent for Penta-/Octa-BDEs in several \napplications\u2014was listed much later, in 2019.\u201d). \n18 Arlene Blum et al., Organophosphate Ester Flame Retardan ts: Are They a Regrettable \nSubstitution for Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers? , 6 Env\u2019t Sci. & Tech Letters 638, 639 (2019). \n19 See EPA, EPA-740-R1-5001, TSCA Work Plan Chemical Pr oblem Formulation and Initial \nAssessment: Chlorinated Phosphate Ester Cluster Flame Retardants  at 11 (Aug. 2015) (\u201cTSCA \nProblem Formulation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-\n09/documents/cpe_fr_clus ter_problem_formulation.pdf  (\u201c[A]lthough commercial uses of TCEP \nas a flame retardant were declining . . .

The National Academies \nhave found that a class-based approach would \u201cmake regulatory hazard and risk assessment \nmuch more efficient\u201d and \u201cbegin to . . . addres s[]\u201d the \u201cproblem of re grettable substitution,\u201d \nmaking it \u201cthe only possible practic al approach for a set of che micals as large as the OFRs.\u201d30 A \nclass-based risk evaluation would also facilitate the considerati on of cumulative risk, as the \nNational Academies and EPA\u2019s Science Advi sory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) have \nconsistently called for.31 Recognizing the benefits of a multiple-chemical assessment, in 2014 \nEPA commenced a TSCA risk assessment for TCEP along with two st ructurally similar \nphosphate ester flame retardants that were \u201cincreasing[ly used] as substitutes for TCEP.\u201d32 And \nEPA and other governmental aut horities have long evaluated other organohalogen chemicals\u2014\nsuch as PCBs, organophosphate pesticides (\u201cOPs\u201d ), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances \n(\u201cPFAS\u201d)\u2014by class because of their sh ared toxicity and persistence. \nThere is no legal or scientific basis for EPA to reject this \u201cmovement toward a class \napproach\u201d and to evaluate the ri sks posed by TCEP in isolation.33 In addition to violating TSCA\u2019s \n\u201cbest available science\u201d requirement, EPA\u2019s propos ed approach is a poor use of the Agency\u2019s \nlimited resources. EPA should not spend years on the evaluation and management of TCEP\u2019s \nrisks only to see TCEP replaced by TCPP, TDCPP, and other toxic flame retardants that EPA has \nnot targeted for TSCA regulation. To fully acc ount for TCEP\u2019s risks and minimize the likelihood \nof regrettable substitutions, we urge EPA to: (1 ) evaluate the cumulative risks from exposures to \nTCEP and other flame retardants, as set forth in greater detail below,34 and (2) pursue a class-\nbased evaluation of OFRs or identified OFR subclasses, which include k nown TCEP substitutes. \n26 See List of State or Local La ws Banning Organohalogen Flame Retardants in Upholstered \nFurniture (Sept. 22, 2022) (attached as Exhibit A ). \n27 ATSDR, Toxicological Profile for P hosphate Ester Flame Retardants  (Sept. 2012), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp202.pdf . \n28 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(c). \n29 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n30 NASEM OFRs Approach at 4, 6.  \n31 See infra Point VI.B . \n32 TSCA Problem Formulation at 11.  \n33 NASEM OFRs Approach at 6. \n34 See infra Point VI.B.  \n7 II. EPA Appropriately Found That TCEP Pres ents Unreasonable Risk to Human\nHealth and the Environment\nThe draft risk evaluation appropriately concludes that \u201cTCEP presents unreasonable risks\nto human health and the environment.\u201d35 While EPA overlooks and underestimates many of \nTCEP\u2019s risks, its finding that  TCEP presents unreasonable risk  is well supported by the record. \nTCEP is associated with an increased risk  of cancer, neurological  harm, and reproductive \nharm, as well as other serious health and environmental effects.36 According to EPA\u2019s own \nestimates, nearly every occ upational condition of use presen ts unreasonable cancer risks, \nincluding risks as high as 6.9-in-100 from worker s\u2019 dermal exposure to TCEP in paints and \ncoatings alone.37 Inhalation of TCEP from roofing insu lation presents a 4.5-in-100 cancer risk, \nmore than 40,000 times higher than EPA\u2019s standard 1-in-1,000,000 unreasonable risk \nbenchmark.38 TCEP has been widely used in car seats, nursing pillows, and baby toys, and EPA \ncalculated reproductive risks fr om infants\u2019 mouthing of TCEP -containing blocks that are 30 \ntimes worse than the Agency\u2019s accepted benchmark level.39 TCEP presents particularly severe \nrisks to tribal communities, including a greater than 1-in -10 cancer risk from  the consumption of \nTCEP-contaminated fish alone.40 Finally, EPA also calculated un reasonable risks to aquatic life \nfrom multiple uses of TCEP, some of which we re up to 30 times greate r than EPA\u2019s benchmark \nRisk Quotient (\u201cRQ\u201d) of 1.0.41 \nWhile those calculations fail to capture the full extent of TCEP\u2019s risks, the draft risk \nevaluation does contain several important improvements from EPA\u2019s prior TSCA risk \nevaluations. Among them: \n\uf0b7EPA made a risk determination for TCEP as  a whole chemical, as required by TSCA\u2019s\nmandate \u201cto determine whether a chemical s ubstance presents an unreasonable risk of\ninjury to health or the environment.\u201d42\n\uf0b7EP\nA calculated the aggregate risks to consumers who are exposed to TCEP from multiple\nexposure routes,43 although it failed to consider aggreg ate risks to workers, to the general\npopulation, and to people who were expos ed from multiple conditions of use.44\n\uf0b7EP\nA evaluated TCEP\u2019s risks to fenceline co mmunities, a legally re quired analysis that\nEPA nonetheless excluded from its fi rst ten TSCA risk evaluations.45\n35 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n36 Id. at 250\u201385. \n37 Id. at 302. \n38 Id. at 310. \n39 Id. at 308. \n40 Id. at 321. \n41 Id. at 132. \n4215 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). \n43 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 338\u201340. \n44 See infra Point VI.A . \n45 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 205\u201306. \n8 \uf0b7EPA correctly identified tribal populations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible\nsubpopulation\u201d46 whose risks EPA must specifically consider, acknowledged that tribal\npopulations\u2019 distinctive cultures and lifewa ys give rise to many unique exposure\nscenarios and increased exposures to chemi cals such as TCEP, and calculated exposure\nand risk associated with one such scenario\u2014fish consumption.\nIII. EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate All of TCEP\u2019s Conditions of Use\nA.EPA\u2019s Risk Calculations and Unreasonabl e Risk Determination Exclude Six of\nTCEP\u2019s Twenty Identified Conditions of Use\nWhile the draft risk evaluation identifie s 20 conditions of use for TCEP, EPA only \ndetermines the risks associated  with 14 of them. For the re maining six conditions of use\u2014\ncommercial use of fabric and textile products , commercial use of fo am seating and bedding \nproducts, commercial use of  wood resin composites, commercial use of insulation, consumer use \nof paints and coatings, and di sposal (collectively, the \u201cUna ssessed Conditions of Use\u201d)\u2014EPA \nclaims that it \u201cdoes not have sufficient information to determ ine whether they contribute to \nTCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks.\u201d47 \nEPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the risks associat ed with those conditions of use violates \nmultiple provisions of TSCA. First and foremo st, TSCA section 6(b) requires EPA to \u201cconduct \nrisk evaluations . . . to determin e whether a chemical substance pr esents an unreasonable risk . . . \nunder the conditions of use.\u201d48 It is well established that when the word \u201cthe\u201d precedes a \ncollective or plural noun, such as \u201cconditions of use,\u201d it is equivalent to \u201call.\u201d49 TSCA therefore \nrequires EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d the risks associated w ith a chemical under all of the \u201ccircumstances \n. . . under which a chemical substance is in tended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be \nmanufactured, processed, distributed  in commerce, used, or dispos ed of,\u201d which EPA concedes it \ndid not do for the Unassessed Conditions of Use.50 As EPA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit have both recogni zed, the plain text of TSCA and of EPA\u2019s implementing \nregulations \u201cunambiguously do not  grant EPA the discretion\u201d to exclude conditions  of use from a \n46 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A), (F). \n47 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. In additi on to the Unassessed Conditions of Use, EPA \nfailed to measure the risks associated with ot her conditions of use, such as recycling, but \nnonetheless asserted that those uses would not contribute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. As \ndescribed below, those conclusory determinations also violate TSCA. See infra  Point IV .E. \n48 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). TSCA defines \u201cconditions of use\u201d as \u201cthe circumstances . . . under \nwhich a chemical substance is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, \nprocessed, distributed in commer ce, used, or disposed of.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2602(4). \n49 See, e.g., Dutcher v. Matheson , 840 F.3d 1183, 1194 (10th Cir. 2016); Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. \nIns. Co ., 561 F.3d 144, 155 (3d Cir. 2009); Frazier v. Pioneer Ams. LLC , 455 F.3d 542, 546 (5th \nCir. 2006). \n50 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(4), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n9 \n risk evaluation.51 But EPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the risks associated with the Unassessed \nConditions of Use and to determine whether they  contribute to unreasonable risk has the exact \nsame effect as excluding those conditi ons of use from th e risk evaluation.  \n Second, TSCA section 6(a) prov ides that, \u201cif the Administr ator determines\u201d through a \nrisk evaluation under TSCA section 6(b) \u201cthat the manufacture, proce ssing, distribution in \ncommerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or mixture, or  that any combination of such \nactivities, presents an unreasona ble risk of injury to health or the environment,\u201d EPA \u201cshall\u201d \nregulate the chemical \u201cto the extent necessary so that the chemical substance or mixture no \nlonger presents such risk.\u201d52 EPA cannot comply with that mandate to eliminate TCEP\u2019s \nunreasonable risks if EPA has not determined th e extent to which each condition of use, \nindividually and in \u201ccombination,\u201d  contributes to such  risks. The draft risk evaluation thus \ndeprives EPA of the information and analysis that it needs to satisfy TSCA\u2019s risk management \nrequirements. Even if risks from certain Unassessed Conditions of Use \u201care expected to be lower \nthan those associated with [conditions of use] already quantified,\u201d53 as EPA claims, EPA would \nstill need to evaluate those conditions of use to address the risks pres ented by \u201cany combination \nof\u201d TCEP\u2019s uses.54 TSCA\u2019s mandate to \u201cdetermine whether a chemical substance presents an \nunreasonable risk . . . under the conditions of us e\u201d does not permit EPA to stop looking as soon \nas it identifies some unreasonabl e risk from some condition of use.55 Instead, EPA must evaluate \nthe full extent of a chemical\u2019s risks under al l its conditions of use,  individually and in \ncombination.   \nThird, EPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the Una ssessed Conditions of Use violates TSCA\u2019s \nrequirement to \u201ctake into consideration informa tion . . . that is reas onably available to the \nAdministrator\u201d when conducting risk evaluations.56 EPA\u2019s regulations define \u201creasonably \navailable information\u201d to include  not only information in EPA\u2019s possession but also \u201cinformation \nthat EPA . . . can reasonably generate, obtain, and synthesize for use in risk evaluations, \nconsidering the deadlines specified in TSCA.\u201d57 Congress provided EPA up to three-and-a-half \nyears to complete a TSCA risk evaluation, followi ng a year-long prioritiza tion process, precisely \n \n51 Safer Chems., Healthy Fams. v.

EPA also failed to add TCEP  to the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) until \n2023\u2014too late to generate release information fo r the draft risk evaluation\u2014and to lower the \nreporting threshold for the Che mical Data Reporting (\u201cCDR\u201d) ru le and eliminate reporting \nloopholes that allow TCEP manuf acturers and importers to av oid reporting. EPA\u2019s failure to \ncollect information that it claims is needed to ev aluate TCEP \u201cstands in th e face of its significant \nstatutory authority to require that this informat ion be reported . . . and runs contrary to its \nobligation to collect r easonably available information to in form and facilitate its regulatory \nobligations under TSCA.\u201d60 \n While TSCA\u2019s prioritization and risk eval uation deadlines provide d ample time for EPA \nto collect the informatio n it needs to fully evaluate TCEP, in  this case EPA has known of TCEP\u2019s \nlikely risks and data gaps for far longer.

To the extent that EPA lacks chemical-\nspecific exposure data for certain conditions of us e, EPA can use data from other flame retardants \nwith similar uses or, if needed, model exposur es based on reasonable and health protective \nassumptions.69 EPA cannot, however, rely on its own inacti on over the last decade to excuse its \nfailure to conduct the risk evaluation required by TSCA.  \nB.EPA Has Not Adequately Assessed the Risks to Health and the Environment from\nTCEP Disposal\nTSCA requires EPA to comprehensively evaluate  the risks to health and the environment \nfrom TCEP disposal and determine whether dispos al contributes to the chemical\u2019s unreasonable \nrisks.

As noted, EPA asserts that \u201cw aste disposal (landfill or \nincineration, [is] covered in each [condition of use/occupational exposure s cenario]\u201d addressed in \nthe risk evaluation, \u201cas opposed to a separate [condition of use].\u201d78 This approach is flawed, first, \nbecause it inherently fails to capture the full extent of disposal-related exposures for people \nworking in disposal facilities and people living near those facilities.  Facilities such as landfills \nand incinerators likely receive TCEP-containing wastes generated through multiple conditions of \nuse. Accordingly, people who work in, or liv e near, a facility processing or holding TCEP-\ncontaining wastes will not  just experience exposure associated with a single use of TCEP. It is \nirrational for EPA to \u201cconsider\u201d disposal-related releases and exposures in  the context of single \nconditions of use as this is not  how relevant populations will actually be exposed. In addition, \nEPA\u2019s approach is flawed because it omits major categories of TCEP disposal, including disposal \nvia wastewater discharges and disposal of imported articles.79 Further, for many of the conditions \n72 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n73 Id. at 47. \n74 See id.  at 22, 147, 175\u201376 (discussing use of TCEP in aerospace equipment and products, \npaints, construction material s, building insulation, matt resses, and furniture).  \n75 Id. at 42. \n76 Id. at 436; see also id.  at 42 (\u201cWhen used as an additive, TCEP is added to manufactured \nmaterials via physical mixing rather than chemical bonding and as a result, TCEP can easily \nleach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d). \n77 Id. at 19, 39, 84. \n78 Id. at 47. \n79 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating limited subset of conditions of use for which associated disposals \nwere assessed). \n13 \n of use for which EPA purported to consider a ssociated disposals, EPA made no attempt to \nquantify disposal-related releases  or exposures and there is no indication of whether or how EPA \nactually incorporated any \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of these re leases and exposures into its risk \ndeterminations.80 \nEPA\u2019s failure to quantify releases of TCEP associated with wastewater discharges is \nespecially concerning. EPA acknowledges that TC EP is widely detected in surface and \ngroundwater samples, is not effe ctively removed by conventional dr inking water or wastewater \ntreatment, and is released into  the environment through wastew ater effluent and landfill \nleachate.81 EPA observes that \u201cTCEP was among the 10 most frequently found compounds in a \nstudy that collected wastewater fro m multiple sites in the Research  Triangle Park area of North \nCarolina between 2002 and 2005,\u201d and that TCEP a nd other flame retardants \u201cwere measured \nprimarily at sites downstream from municipal wastewater discharges.\u201d82 EPA further notes that \n\u201c[l]aundry wastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastew ater treatment plant influent \nand subsequently to the aquatic environment.\u201d83 Yet EPA fails to utilize readily available data to \nestimate the volume of these releases. These data include multiple sampling studies that \nmeasured TCEP concentrations in wastewater  treatment plant discharges in Los Angeles\u2014\nstudies that EPA itself, as well as the Nationa l Marine Fisheries Service (\u201cNMFS\u201d) previously \nutilized to assess risks to wildlife prot ected under the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d).84 In \naddition, the Washington Department of Ecol ogy recently measured high concentrations of \nTCEP in wastewater discharges from aerosp ace/aircraft modificati on, industrial laundry, \nshipbuilding, and food processing facili ties, as well as in  landfill leachate.85  \n \n80 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating that EPA did not quantify releases or  exposures from disposals \nassociated with numerous commercial uses of TCEP); id. at 49 (acknowledging that \u201cthere may \nbe TCEP releases to the environment via the de molition and disposal of consumer articles, as \nwell as to wastewater via domestic laundry,\u201d but claiming that \u201cEPA  did not have enough \ninformation to assess [these] environmental releases quantitatively\u201d); id. at 51\u201352. \n81 Id. at 39, 42, 45. \n82 Id. at 149, 188. \n83 Id. at 75.  \n84 See Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7(a)(2) Biological \nOpinion and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Consultation and Management Act Essential Fish Habitat Response  80 (Mar. 2022), https://repository. library.noaa.gov/view /noaa/37544; EPA \nRegion 9, Biological Evaluation and Esse ntial Fish Habitat Assessm ent for Discharges to the \nPacific Ocean from Outfalls Associated w ith the City of Los Angeles Hyperion Water \nReclamation Plant and Wastew ater Collection Systems  at 7, 21 (Jan. 2023), \nhttps://repository .library.noaa.gov/ view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.38 of PDF); Los Angeles \nSanitation, Hyperion Treatment Plant and Te rminal Island Water Reclamation Plant Special \nStudy Final Report, Constituents of Emerging Concern (CECs) Special Study  at 5, 7\u20138 (Apr. \n2020), https://repository.libr ary.noaa.gov/view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.161 of PDF).  \n85 Siana Wong, Wash.

The study also \n \n14 \n It is unclear why EPA failed to utilize these da ta, in combination with information that is \nreferenced in the draft risk ev aluation, to estimate TCEP releases associated with municipal \nwastewater treatment plant discharg es and direct industrial discharg es. It is similarly unclear why \nEPA could not quantify releases fr om landfills and incinera tors. As to landfills, EPA claims it is \nimpossible to produce such estima tes \u201c[w]ithout a full characteri zation of non-hazardous landfill \n. . . conditions and historical wastes . . . around the country.\u201d86 But EPA modeled TCEP releases \nfrom landfills,87 and more recent data on organophosphate flame retardants in landfill leachate \nare available and could be combined with the da ta cited in the draft risk evaluation to better \ncharacterize environmental releases  of TCEP in landfill leachate.88 EPA\u2019s assertion that \u201c[s]ource \nattribution of the consumer uses to the leach ing concentration exhibited . . . [in the risk \nevaluation] are not available, \u201d purportedly precluding a dete rmination of whether \u201cthese \nconcentrations are the result of consumer an d/or commercial dispos al,\u201d is irrelevant.89 EPA must \nassess all \u201ccircumstances . . . under which [TCEP]  is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to \nbe . . . disposed of,\u201d90 and in prior risk evalua tions it has characterized disposal as a condition of \nuse, without attempting to allocate dispos al-related exposures between comme rcial and \nconsumer uses.91 Here, too, quantifying the proportion of landfill leaching attributable to \nconsumer versus commercial di sposal is not required.   \nMoreover, for the limited disposal -related releases that EPA did attempt to quantify, it \nutilized loading rates th at substantially understate the quantity of TCEP that is currently in, or \nwill foreseeably be entering, the waste phase. Specifically, EPA calcula ted disposal-related \nreleases based on estimated domestic produc tion volumes of 2,500 pounds  per year or 25,000 \npounds per year.92 Even assuming for the sake of argumen t that those estimates were accurate \nwith respect to current  TCEP production volume, EPA ac knowledges that U.S. production \nvolume for TCEP was nearly 100 per cent greater just ten years ago.93 That figure\u2014which does \n \ndetected V6\u2014a flame retardant that includes TC EP as an impurity\u2014in wa stewater from many of \nthose same source categories. \n86 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 149. \n87 Id. at 84\u201385. \n88 See, e.g. , Trine Eggen et al., Municipal Landfill Leachates: A Significant Source for New and \nEmerging Pollutants , 408 Sci.

Yet EPA\u2019s analysis fails to account for this reality.  \nIt is critical for EPA to char acterize these releases accurately  given, among other factors, \nthe \u201cpotential for TCEP to migrate to groundwater and dom estic wells from nearby non-\nhazardous waste landfills . . . or historic waste sites.\u201d97 Indeed, older landfills holding TCEP-\ncontaining articles are especially likely to leach  TCEP, as they \u201care more  likely to lack the \ninfrastructure of modern landfill s, such as liners, leachate co llection systems, and reactive \nbarriers, which would prevent leachate from entering the groundwater system.\u201d98 In revising the \ndraft risk evaluation, EPA must incorporate accu rate loading rates for TCEP-containing waste \ndisposed via landfilling, incine ration, and wastewater to a void substantially understating \ndisposal-related expos ures and risks. \nEPA also must correct additional flaws in its analysis of TCEP releases from waste \nincineration. First, EPA must eval uate exposure and risk associated with the toxic byproducts that \nresult from incineration of TCEP-c ontaining wastes. In the draft ri sk evaluation, EPA states that \n\u201cthermal treatment and open bur ning are not favorable options  for the disposal of TCEP\u201d \nbecause they generate significan t TCEP releases and also \u201cproduce numerous toxic byproducts, \n \n94 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 22 (\u201cIn the past, TCEP was processed in many products \nmade in the United States, includ ing fabrics and textiles, some types of foam, and construction \nmaterials\u2014some of which may still be in use today.\u201d); William A.

EPA must do so in the final \nrisk evaluation, utilizing waste-volume estimates th at reflect real world conditions. Second, in so \ndoing, EPA must consider the speci fic risks associated with treat ment of TCEP-containing wastes \nin nonhazardous solid waste incine rators versus open burning, as  these approaches will differ \nsubstantially in the extent of TCEP releases and releases of  toxic products of incomplete \ncombustion. As explained below, these differences must be accounted for in analyzing risks to \npotentially exposed or susceptible subpopul ations such as tribal populations.   \nC. EPA Fails to Evaluate Many of TCEP\u2019s Conditions of Use \nLike other OFRs, TCEP is used as a plasticizer  and a flame retardant in a range of plastic \nproducts. For instance, TCEP is \u201cused as an additi ve plasticiser . . . for polyurethane, polyesters, \npolyvinyl chloride and other polymers.\u201d100 TCEP has also been detected in high-density \npolyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d) water pipes,101 from which it can leach into water supplies and enter the \nenvironment.102 In some products, TCEP is also used \u201cas  a secondary plastici ser . . . to suppress \nthe flammability resulting from plasticisers such as phthalates.\u201d103 \u201cWhen used as an additive, \nTCEP is added to manufactured materials via ph ysical mixing rather th an chemical bonding and \nas a result, TCEP can easily leach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d104   \nThe foregoing plastic uses ar e all \u201ccircumstances . . . unde r which [TCEP] is intended, \nknown, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used, or \ndisposed of,\u201d and must th erefore be considered in the draft risk evaluation.105 But while EPA \nconsiders exposures to TCEP from plastics used  in certain aerospace equipment and children\u2019s \ntoys, it fails to evaluate the ma nufacturing, use, and disposal of  polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d) and \nHDPE pipes and other plastic material s that are known to contain TCEP.106 EPA also ignores the \n \n99 Id. at 437\u201338; see also id.  at 45 (\u201c[T]here is a robust conf idence that TCEP . . . produces \nhazardous byproducts when undergoing thermal degradation . . .\u201d). \n100 Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Biotechnology Info., Nat\u2019l Li br. of Med/, PubChem Annotation Record for \nTRIS(2-CHLOROETHYL) PHOSPHATE \u00a7 8.1, PubChem, https://pubchem.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/compound/8295  (last visited Feb. 6, 2024).  \n101 Tomas Diera et al., A Non-Target Screening Study of High-Density Polyethylene Pipes \nRevealed Rubber Compounds as Main Contaminant  in a Drinking Water Distribution System , \n229 Water Rsch.

It is irrelevant \nwhether TCEP is currently being used to ma ke those products, since TSCA requires EPA to \n \n17 \n presence of TCEP in microplastics that form from the breakdown of larg er plastics containing \nTCEP, or that adsorb and spr ead TCEP in the environment.107 This omission is particularly \nconcerning since studies have found that micr oplastic co-exposures can exacerbate TCEP\u2019s \nneurotoxicity.108 Microplastics containing TCEP can be ingested by fish, other wildlife, and \npeople, resulting in aggregate and cumulative risks that EPA unlawfully failed to address.109 To \nfully evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks \u201cunder the conditions of use,\u201d EPA must assess a broader range of \nplastic uses, as well as the presence of TCEP in microplastics, in its final risk evaluation.110 \nOther reported conditions of use, which are not mentioned in the draft risk evaluation, \ninclude the use of TCEP  in \u201clubricating oil,\u201d111 as \u201can extractant for rare metals,\u201d112 as a \u201cthermal \ncoolant\u201d for metals,113 and in \u201clithium batteries.\u201d114 EPA must look into those uses as well, and \neither include them in the TCEP risk evalua tion or justify its deci sion to exclude them.  \nIV. EPA Underestimates Exposures to TCEP \nA. The Draft Risk Evaluation Is Predicat ed on an Unsupported Assumption Concerning \nTCEP Manufacturing and Import V olumes \nEPA\u2019s calculations of TCEP\u2019s risks to workers, the genera l population, and the \nenvironment are based on an unsupported assump tion concerning the amount of TCEP that is \npresently manufactured or imported. Since EP A has no workplace monitoring or environmental \nrelease data for most of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e, the Agency instead evaluates TCEP exposures \n \nconsider a chemical\u2019s legacy us es as well as its ongoing ones.

Indeed, a 2018 study estimated 1,110 \nkilograms (2,425 pounds) of annual TC EP air emissions in the City of Toronto alone, with a \nhigh-end estimate (95% confidence in terval) of 26,000 kilograms (57,320 pounds)125 With a \nsingle Canadian city estimate d to release nearly 2,500 pounds of  TCEP per year, EPA cannot \njustify calculating national TCEP releas es and exposures based on a 2,500-pound production \nestimate. EPA should instead evaluate risk based on a current production level that is equal to or \ngreater than the CDR repor ting threshold of 25,000 pounds, while also accounting for \nsubstantially higher domestic production and imp ort of TCEP in the recent past.     \n EPA\u2019s reliance on current production levels to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks understates the \nchronic risks to people who were exposed to far greater amounts of  TCEP in earlier life stages.126  \nBetween 1986 and 2002, the CDR-reported produc tion volume for TCEP was between 1,000,000 \nand 10,000,000 pounds, and in 2006 it was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pounds\u2014several \norders of magnitude higher th an EPA\u2019s current 2,500-pound estimate.127 TCEP presents cancer \nand other chronic risks that accru e over a lifetime of exposures , and EPA calculates those risks \nusing a \u201clifetime averag e daily dose\u201d representing the averag e amount of TCEP that someone is \nexposed to each day over the course of their lifetime.128 For the purpose of determining a \nLifetime Average Daily Dose, past exposure levels within a person\u2019s lifespan are just as relevant \nas current ones. As the SACC advised EPA in  its report on the draft risk evaluation for \nperchloroethylene: \n[O]lder data should be used to estimate  prior exposure doses, which can then be \nadded to exposures going forw ard in time. It is unrealis tic to only address [those] \nwho start their exposures today (or within the last 10 years only).

Those older \nexposures are relevant to today\u2019s added risks.129   \nWhile EPA cannot turn back the clock and undo those prior exposures, it must regulate \ncurrent TCEP uses and exposure \u201cto the extent necessary\u201d so that the Lifetime Average Daily \nDose remains below the level a ssociated with unreasonable ris k. Moreover, as described above, \nEPA must consider prior production and import levels when evaluating the risks from TCEP \ndisposal, because much of the TC EP-containing waste that is curren tly being disposed of, or that \nis currently leaching out of landfills, comes from articles and products that  were manufactured or \nimported decades ago.130 By calculating risk using only an estimate of current production \nvolume\u2014which in itself is unjustifiably low\u2014EPA underestimates the chronic risks to workers, \nconsumers, and others who were exposed to much  higher levels of TCEP in earlier decades and \nviolates TSCA\u2019s mandate to appl y the \u201cbest available science.\u201d131  \nB. EPA Understates Infants\u2019 and Children\u2019s Exposures to TCEP \n The draft risk evaluation recognizes that \u201c[i]nfants are a pote ntially susceptible \npopulation because of their higher exposure per body weight, immature metabolic systems, and \nthe potential for chemical toxicants to disrupt sensitive developmental processes, among other \nreasons.\u201d132 Infants are exposed to TCEP from the milk they drink, the toys they play with, the \nmattresses they sleep on, and other sources. In multiple ways, however, EPA understates those \nexposures. \n First, EPA assumes that infants br eastfeed for a maximum of one year, 133 despite \nevidence and public health reco mmendations to the contrary . The American Academy of \nPediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend the contin uation of breastfeeding for at \nleast two years or longer,134 and CDC data show that more th an 17 percent of infants are still \nbreastfed at 18 months of age.135 EPA\u2019s assumption that breastfeeding will end after one year is \n \n129 TSCA Sci.

EPA concedes that \u201c[i]nformation on . . . \nmouthing durations\u201d was \u201climited,\u201d137 and the Exposure Factors Handbook recommends 95th \npercentile mouthing durations rangi ng from 11 minutes per hour (fo r children aged two to three \nyears) to 26 minutes per hour (for ch ildren aged three to six months.)138 EPA claims that its \nmouthing values were taken from EPA\u2019s Consumer  Exposure Model (\u201cCEM\u201d) but it does not say \nhow the model derived those estimates,  whereas the recommendations in the Exposure Factors \nHandbook  are backed by multiple studies of in fants\u2019 and children\u2019s mouthing behaviors.139 EPA \nshould use the 95th percentile mouthing durations from the Exposure Factors Handbook , or any \nhigher estimates in published literature, to calculate TCEP mouthing exposures. \n Third, while EPA separately calculated the risks from infants\u2019 breastfeeding and \nmouthing, it failed to consider  the risks to infants who ar e exposed to TCEP from both \nbreastmilk and the products they mouth, as  well as other exposure pathways.140 Breastfeeding \nand mouthing are both typical in fant behaviors, making it highly likely that a significant number \nof infants will be exposed from bo th pathways. Similarly, when calculating the concentrations of \nTCEP in breastmilk, EPA considered maternal TC EP exposures from individual conditions of use \nin insolation, but failed to cons ider aggregate exposures to la ctating people who are exposed \nfrom multiple conditions of use and thus have gr eater levels of TCEP in  their breastmilk. As \ndescribed in greater detail below,  EPA\u2019s failure to consider those aggregate exposures is contrary \nto TSCA and inconsistent with the best available science.141 \nC. EPA Also Understates Consumer, Worker , and General Population Exposures to \nTCEP \n EPA also understates consumer, worker, a nd general population exposures to TCEP.  \nFirst, EPA underestimates the c oncentrations of TCEP in polyu rethane foam products that are \nused by consumers and workers, including furn iture and automobile cushioning. While TCEP \nhas been detected at concentrations up to 19,800 mg/kg (1.98 percent)  in such foam, EPA \n \n136 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 195. \n137 Id. at 192. \n138 EPA, EPA/600/R-09/052F, Exposure Factors Handbook: 2011 Edition , at 4-3 (Sept. 2011) \n(\u201cExposure Factors Handbook\u201d), https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/e ims/eimscomm.getfile?p_downl oad_id=522996 (recommending \n95\nth percentile mouthing duration values of 11-26 minutes per hour, depending on age). \n139 Compare Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 197, with Exposure Factors Handbook at 4-3, 4-12 \nto 4-14. \n140 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 245. \n141 See infra  Point VI.A. \n22 \n disregards that data and assumes TCEP c oncentrations of less than one percent.142 EPA asserts \nthat the lower values were \u201ct hought to be more current and representative of the U.S. \npopulation,\u201d presumably because the higher conc entrations were taken from a German study \npublished in 2001 (the \u201cIngerowski study\u201d).143 But TCEP and TCEP-containing products are \nimported into the United States , and many older vehicles and products containing TCEP foam \nare either still in use or are being disposed  of. Moreover, EPA relies on the Ingerowski study\u2014\nand other data that predates that study by more than a decade\u2014to calculate other TCEP \nexposures.144 EPA should similarly use that study when calculating TCEP exposures from \npolyurethane foam products. \n EPA also ignores workers\u2019 incidental inges tion of TCEP-containing dust that settles on \ntheir hands and clothing, despite pr eviously \u201cacknowledg[ing] that oral exposures are a potential \nroute for workers and agree[ing]  that hand-to-mouth and inges tion of dust particles can be \nsources of occupational oral exposure.\u201d145 TCEP has been detected in dust samples taken from \nresidential spaces, public spaces, vehicles, and recycling facilities.146 While EPA considered \nconsumers\u2019 ingestion of TCEP-containing dust,  it excludes that e xposure route from its \noccupational risk assessment and thus unde restimates workers\u2019 exposures and risks.147  \n Finally, EPA understates the duration and vol ume of general population exposures to \nTCEP. EPA  falsely assumes that no one will be e xposed to TCEP in the ambient air or surface \nwater for more than 33 years, based on a decades-o ld study of how long most people remained in \na single residence.148 But as the SACC advised EPA in its recent report on th e supplemental 1,4-\ndioxane risk evaluation, the \u201c homeowner mobility value (33 years) \u2026 is inadequate for \n[potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulat ion] communities,\u201d which TSCA expressly \nrequires EPA to consider, and is \u201carguably invalid for the general population as well.\u201d149 EPA\u2019s \nassumption understates the risks to people who rema in the in same reside nce for longer than 33 \nyears, as well as to people who move within a given community but remain exposed to the same \n \n142 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 175. \n143 Id. \n144 Id.

It is \u201cclearly not representative of tribes [or] diverse socioeconomic \ncommunities,\u201d who often have lo wer levels of geographic mobili ty and stronger connections to \nthe places where they live.150 The best available science requir es EPA to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks \nto impacted communities and th e general population ove r an entire lifetime, as opposed to \narbitrarily cutting off its expos ure calculations after 33 years.151  \nD. EPA Unlawfully Ignores Most Dietary Exposures to TCEP \nEPA further understates risks to exposed populations by ignoring dietary exposures \nbeyond contaminated fish. According to EPA, \u201c[a]n Australian study indicated that more than 75 \npercent of the estimated daily intake  of TCEP came from dietary ingestion.\u201d152   \nBut EPA excludes the vast majority of t hose dietary exposures from its draft risk \nevaluation, improperly attributi ng them to \u201cnon-TSCA\u201d uses.153 Contrary to EPA\u2019s claim, many \ndietary exposures are subject to  regulation under TSCA and must be evaluated and regulated by \nEPA. While TSCA excludes from the definition of chemical substance \u201cany food,\u201d as defined in \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201c FFDCA\u201d), \u201cwhen manufactured, processed, or \ndistributed in commerce for use as a food,\u201d not  all foods and methods of food production fall \nwithin the scope of that exclusion.154 For instance, just as subsistence fishing does not constitute \nthe \u201cmanufactur[ing], process[ing], or distribu t[ion] in commerce\u201d of an FFDCA-regulated food \nproduct, neither does the cu ltivation of crops, gathering of pl ants, or raising of livestock for \npersonal consumption. Yet the draft risk evaluati on does not evaluate whether TCEP\u2019s conditions \nof use may cause soil, water, or biosolids cont amination that result in  non-excluded dietary \nexposures ( e.g., from personal garden ing and farming.) \nMoreover, even uses that are not regulate d under TSCA still must be considered as \nbackground exposures when evaluating the risk s posed by TCEP. As EPA has previously \nacknowledged, \u201c[t]he potential ri sks of non-TSCA uses may help inform the Agency\u2019s risk \ndetermination for the exposures from uses that are covered under TSCA.\u201d155 Here, people with \ngreater dietary exposures will have higher levels of  TCEP in their bodies, and will thus be more \nsusceptible to harm from additional exposures .

For example, in its a ssessment and regulation of the \npesticide fumigant sulfuryl fluoride, EPA\u2019s Office  of Pesticide Programs (\u201cOPP\u201d) considered all \nsources of exposure to fluoride,  including ones EPA does not re gulate (such as toothpaste). \nConsidering these exposures was critical for accurate risk calcula tion and decision-making\u2014\nOPP proposed to terminate pesticid al uses of sulfuryl fluoride b ecause children\u2019s total exposure \nto fluoride (mainly from drinking water and toothpaste) exceeded acceptable exposure levels.158 \nEPA\u2019s Office of Water similarly routinely acc ounts for background exposures to contaminants \nwhen establishing drinking water standards by ap plying a default assumption that 80 percent of \ntotal contaminant exposures ar ise from non-water sources, desp ite those exposures falling \noutside of the regulatory purview of the Safe Drinking Water Act.159 Here, too, dietary exposures \ncontribute to TCEP\u2019s total risks and exacerbate  the risks that people experience from TSCA \nregulated uses. EPA must consider those exposures in the final risk evaluation.  \nE. EPA Understates Exposure Associated with  Recycling of TCEP-Containing Materials \nEPA has not fully or accurately characteri zed environmental releases, occupational \nexposures, or consumer exposures associated with the recycling of materials containing TCEP. \nEPA understates releases and exposures associated with e-waste recycling and fails to consider \nenvironmental, occupational, or consumer expos ures associated with the recycling of other \nTCEP-containing products, such as polyurethane foam. EPA must co rrect the flaws, and fill the \ngaps, in its analysis of recycling-relate d exposures in the final risk evaluation. \nIn the draft risk evaluation, EPA asserts that it  \u201cwas not able to quantify releases of TCEP \nthat could occur during the recycling of e-waste.\u201d160 Nonetheless, EPA asserts that \u201ctotal releases \nare expected to be low since TCEP is  not typically used in electronics\u201d161 and on that basis \nconcludes that the recycling condition of use does not contri bute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable \n \n156 See infra  Point VI. \n157 See Nat\u2019l Rsch.

Indeed, \nthe source EPA cites for the proposition that TCEP is not typically used in  electronics, Stapleton \net al. 2011, concerns detections of TCEP in fo am and does not discuss th e extent to which TCEP \nor any other flame retardan t is used in electronics.163 Contrary to EPA\u2019s characterization, peer-\nreviewed literature analyzing TCEP concentrations in e-waste recycling facilities indicates that \nTCEP releases are strongly associated with e- waste recycling. For exam ple, Gravel et al. 2019 \ndetected TCEP in 100 percent of air samples from Canadian e-waste recycling facilities, \ncompared to 67 percent of control group samples.164 Along with triphenyl phosphate (\u201cTPhP\u201d), \nTCEP was measured at the hi ghest concentrations among all organophosphate esters analyzed \nand was associated with the processing of both older [cathode ray tube] televisions and newer \ntelevisions.165 Nguyen et al. 2019 also detected TCEP a nd other flame retardants in dust and air \nsamples at Canadian e-waste processing f acilities, with TCEP \u201cthe most abundant \n[organophosphate ester flame retardan t] in workbench air samples.\u201d166 Further, Nguyen et al. \n2019 measured higher dust concentr ations at workbenches compared  to a central location within \nthe facility, \u201cconsistent with the release of  contaminated dust during dismantling\u201d of \nelectronics.167  \nMoreover, EPA makes no attempt to characteri ze releases and exposures associated with \nthe recycling of other TCEP-containing material s, including polyurethane  foam, in which EPA \nasserts TCEP \u201cis predominantly found.\u201d168 Polyurethane foam is r ecycled through a variety of \nprocesses,169 including mechanical processes that genera te substantial amounts of dust during the \nchopping or shredding of foam.170 Recycling of polyurethane foam  exposes recycling workers, \ncommunities, and the environment near recycling facilities; carpet installers; and consumers who \npurchase recycled-content products such as \u201crebo nd\u201d carpet padding or upholstered furniture that \ncontains recycled foam. \u201cPost-consumer foam (o ld carpet cushion) now returning for recycling \nmay contain up to 12 percent by weight\u201d of TCEP and other halogenated flame retardants, which \n \n162 Id. at 355, 364. \n163 Heather M.

EPA Underestimates TCEP\u2019s Hazards \nA. EPA Overlooks and Misapplies Ne cessary Uncertainty Factors \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s hazards and risks, EP A disregarded the best available science, \nas well as EPA\u2019s own risk assessment guidance,  concerning the use of uncertainty factors.  \nUncertainty factors are \u201cvery impor tant . . . to determining the sa fety of [chemicals] . . . to \nhumans,\u201d172 since they account for gaps and uncertainti es in the risk assessment process that \ncould otherwise \u201cresult [in] an incomplete char acterization of the chemical\u2019s toxicity\u201d and an \n\u201cunderprotective\u201d risk calculation.173  The use of appropriate uncerta inty factors is necessary to \nconduct risk evaluations \u201cin a manner consis tent with the best available science.\u201d174 In its draft \nrisk evaluation, however, EPA failed to apply tw o critical uncertainty factors and misapplied \nanother.  \nFirst, when calculating TCEP\u2019s chronic repr oductive toxicity, EPA relied on a subchronic \nduration study without applying the recommended \u201csubchronic-to- chronic-duration\u201d uncertainty \nfactor.175 In the draft risk evaluation, EPA explains that it chose \u201ca study with a shorter exposure \nduration\u201d to assess \u201cchronic exposure scenarios because it resulted in a[] [human equivalent \ndose] that is more sensitive . . . than most longer-term results.\u201d176 The problem is not that EPA \nselected the wrong study to calcu late reproductive risks, but ra ther that EPA misapplied the \nresults of that study.

As described above, EPA claims that it la cks sufficient data to evaluate several of \nTCEP\u2019s conditions of use.180 EPA also asserts that \u201cthe currentl y available evidence is inadequate \nto assess whether TCEP may cause endocrine ch anges,\u201d \u201cthyroid change s,\u201d \u201clung or respiratory \neffects in humans,\u201d or \u201cimmunological or hematological effects in humans.\u201d181 Those asserted \ngaps do not excuse EPA from evaluating all of TCEP \u2019s conditions of use and health effects, and \nEPA has an established approach for addressing precisely those so rts of database deficiencies. \n\u201c[T]o account for the potential fo r deriving an underpro tective [risk estimate] as a result of an \nincomplete characterization of th e chemical\u2019s toxicity,\u201d EPA gui dance recommends the use of an \nadditional \u201cdatabase deficiency\u201d uncertainty factor.182 In light of EPA\u2019s own claims of inadequate \ndata, EPA must apply that uncertainty factor here. \n Finally, EPA misapplies the \u201cintraspecies\u201d uncertainty factor, which is intended to \n\u201caccount for variations in susceptib ility\u201d within the general population.183 The intraspecies \nuncertainty factor is designed to  cover the myriad sources of variations within the general \npopulation, not the increased risks faced by disc rete potentially expos ed or susceptible \nsubpopulations. EPA has applied that ten-fold uncer tainty factor even in  circumstances where it \nfound \u201cno evidence of increased susceptibility fo r any single group relative to the general \npopulation,\u201d184 while acknowledging that \u201ca 10 -fold factor may . . . be too small\u201d to account for \n \n177 EPA Review of Ref.

Instead of calculating the risks to  those subpopulations\u2014s uch as people who are \nmore susceptible to TCEP\u2019s risks because of genetic conditions like Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletion, and myotonic dys trophy\u2014EPA asserts that their increased \nsusceptibility is \u201c[a]ddressed\u201d through the \u201c[u]se of [the] de fault [intraspecies uncertainty \nfactor].\u201d\n186  But that uncertainty factor is intend ed to address unspeci fied variations in \nsusceptibility across the general pop ulation, not the heighted risks f aced by identified potentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulations. Indeed, if a ten-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is \nused to account for general popula tion variation even in the abse nce of a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation,187 the same adjustment plainly cannot account for those who are \nknown to experience increased susceptibility, and EPA offers no evidence that its default \nuncertainty factor would adequately capture the risks to all potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations. When EPA identifies potentiall y exposed or susceptible subpopulations, EPA \nmust calculate their risks separa tely from those of the genera l population, as opposed to relying \non a default uncertainty factor  that\u2014by EPA\u2019s own admission\u2014m ay not be up to the task.188 \nB. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Neurotoxicity Risks \nContrary to typical agency pr actice and the best available science, EPA failed to use the \nmost sensitive study when calculating TCEP\u2019s neurotoxic effects (the \u201cTilson study\u201d). EPA \nacknowledges that the Tilson study was the \u201cmos t sensitive\u201d neurotoxicity study after accounting \nfor uncertainty factors, resulting in risk esti mates that are far greater than those that EPA \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.189 But EPA did not use that study because \u201cthe authors \n \n185 EPA Review of Ref.

Inde ed, were EPA to maintain a singl e uncertainty factor to account \nfor all sources of intraspecies variability, the best  available science indicates that the uncertainty \nfactor would have to be far greater than 10.

In partic ular, the ratio of the benchmark margin of \nexposure (expressed as \u201ctotal UF\u201d)  to the point of departure (expr essed as human equivalent dose \nor HED) is approximately 4.6 for the Tilson stud y and approximately 3.2 for the study selected \nby EPA, indicating that the Tilson study is mo re sensitive and would result in higher risk \ncalculations than those calculated  in the draft risk evaluation. Id. at 276\u201377. \n29 \n tested only a single dose level, which did not allow a full understanding of the dose-response for \nTCEP\u201d and \u201conly a [Lowest Observed Adverse Ef fect Level, or \u201cLOAEL\u201d] was identified,\u201d as \nopposed to a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (\u201cNOAEL\u201d).190   \nNone of those arguments justifies the decisi on to understate TCEP\u2019s neurotoxicity risks. \nWhile the Tilson study did involve only one dos e, nothing precludes EPA from relying on a \nsingle-dose study when it is the most sensitive, and EPA does not  need \u201ca full understanding of \nthe dose-response\u201d in order to establish a point  of departure and calc ulate risks from that \nstudy.191 Indeed, the Tilson study has been favorabl y cited in an analys is conducted for the \nCPSC,192 by Environment Canada and Health Canada,193 and, previously, by EPA itself.194 \nSimilarly, the fact that the Tilson study did not identify a NOA EL does not support disregarding \nthe study. EPA frequently calculate s risks based on LOAELs, using a ten-fold uncertainty factor \nto account for the absence of a NOAEL.195 To capture all of TCEP\u2019s potential risks, it is critical \nthat EPA use the most sensitive study for each endpoint, including the Tilson study for \nneurotoxicity.  \nC. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Cancer Risks \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s cancer risks, EPA re lied exclusively on kidney tumor data even \nthough TCEP exposures have been associat ed with other cancer sites as well.196 In addition to \nkidney cancer, studies have linked TC EP to leukemia and thyroid cancer.197 EPA admits that \n\u201c[u]se of tumor data for only one target organ ( i.e., not combining incidence with other target \norgan tumors) may result in so me underestimation of risk.\u201d198 But EPA made no effort to address \nthat concern by calculating total cancer risks. \nEPA must consider all know n cancer sites in its dose -response analysis and its \ndetermination of whether TCEP presents unrea sonable cancer risks.

EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate TCEP\u2019s Risks to Potentially Exposed or \nSusceptible Subpopulations  \n The draft risk evaluation also violates TSCA\u2019s  mandate to evaluate risks to \u201cpotentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d who, \u201cdue to either greater susc eptibility or greater \nexposure, may be at greater risk than the ge neral population of advers e health effects from \nexposure\u201d to TCEP.201  As set forth below, EPA fails to consider several pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations\u2014including people w ho have \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP from \nmultiple conditions of use or exposure pathways or who have \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to harm \nbecause of their cumulative exposures to other flame retardants and toxi c chemicals in addition \nto TCEP. Additionally, EPA understates the risks to the potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations that it did identify.  \nA. EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Exposures and Risks to People Who Are \nExposed to TCEP From Multiple Conditions of Use and Exposure Pathways \n TSCA requires EPA to evaluate risks to those who are exposed to a chemical from \nmultiple conditions of use or from multiple exposure routes and pathways. First, such \npopulations experience \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater risk\u201d than  the general population because \nof those aggregate exposures, and thus consti tute a \u201cpotentially e xposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d that EPA must evaluate under TSCA section 6(b).202 In addition, TSCA section \n6(a) directs EPA to eliminate the unreasonable risks from \u201cany combination of\u201d a chemical\u2019s \nconditions of use, which is only possible if EPA fi rst evaluates the risks from such combinations \nof exposures and determines whether they are unreasonable.203 Finally, TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available \nscience\u201d mandate compels the considerat ion of aggregate exposures and risks.204 The National \nAcademies have acknowledged the \u201cneed for\u201d risk assessment to  cover \u201caggregate exposure . . . \n \n199 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment  at 1-12 to 1-13; see also EPA, EPA-740-R1-8012, \nRisk Evaluation for Asbestos  Part I: Chrysotile Asbestos  173\u2013175 (Dec. 2020),   \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-\n12/documents/1_risk_evaluation_for_asb estos_part_1_chrysotile_asbestos.pdf  (adding the risks \nassociated with multiple types of cancer associ ated with chrysotile asbestos to determine the \noverall cancer risk).   \n200 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 291. \n201 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n202 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n203 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n204 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n31 \n [from] all routes, pathways, and sour ces of exposure to a given agent,\u201d205 and EPA\u2019s SACC has \nspecifically advised EPA to aggregate exposures  from multiple conditions of use under TSCA.206 \n EPA itself has recognized that \u201cin devel oping a comprehensive risk estimate for a \nchemical substance, it is  the Agency\u2019s responsibility to consid er the aggregation of what may be \nlower individual exposures from individual c onditions of use and routes of exposure.\u201d207 In its \nrecently proposed revisions to the TSCA risk ev aluation rule, EPA states that it \u201cwill consider \naggregate exposures to the chemical substance.\u201d208   \n In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA ignores all aggr egate exposures from \ncombinations of conditions of use and most aggr egate exposures from combinations of exposure \npathways and routes.209 While EPA claims to \u201clack . . . r easonably available data indicating co-\nexposures of multiple TCEP containing activit ies or products in the occupational and indoor \nenvironment,\u201d EPA cannot disregard aggregate ex posures merely because it failed to gather \ninformation on them.210 TSCA requires EPA to evaluate the risks posed by TCEP through the \n\u201ccircumstances . . . under which [the] chemical  substance is intende d, known, or reasonably \nforeseen to be manufactured, processed, distribute d in commerce, used, or disposed of.\u201d211  \nTCEP\u2019s uses are neither rare nor  unforeseen; the chemical has been widely used as a flame \nretardant and plasticizer in hom e insulation, furniture, rugs, and other common products. It is \nthus virtually inevitable, and certainly \u201creasonably  foreseen,\u201d that some of the people whose roof \ncontains TCEP insulation also own a rug or a vehi cle with TCEP as well, and that some of the \npeople who are exposed to TCEP on the job also  have TCEP-containing products and materials \nin their homes.212 EPA must evaluate those reasonably fo reseen combinations of exposures, and \nthe risk evaluation contains all of the inform ation that EPA needs to do so. Since EPA has \ncalculated the exposures from those conditions of use individually, it can add them to calculate \nrisks to the people who are exposed  from reasonably foreseen combin ations of conditions of use. \nAs further support for those aggr egate exposure calculations, EP A should consider studies of \n \n205 Science and Decisions at 266. \n206 TSCA Sci.

First, as described above, EPA has not \nsupported its total produ ction volume estimate of 2,500 pounds per year.214 Second, even if that \nestimate were supported and all pr oduction-related re leases were attributed to a single pathway, \nthe public would still expe rience aggregate exposures that EPA has not accounted for. In addition \nto production-related releases of TCEP, people ar e also exposed to TCEP  from landfill leachate \n(which is the result of historic  as well as ongoing TCEP use), the consumption of contaminated \nfish and wildlife (which does not depend on cu rrent production volumes alone), and from other \nexposure routes and pathways. Rather than \u201cdou ble count[ing]\u201d exposures, the consideration of \nrisks across exposure routes and pathways\u2014ma ny of which are not tied to TCEP\u2019s current \nproduction volume\u2014would more accurately re flect real-world exposures and risks.  \n EPA also claims that when a single exposure pathway or condition of use is sufficient to \nestablish unreasonable risk, the consideration of additional, aggregate exposures is unnecessary.\n215 This argument misunderstands the central purpose of a risk evaluation, which is \nnot only to determine the n eed for risk management ( i.e., whether an unreasonable risk exists) \nbut also to determine the extent of the risk management needed. TSCA requires EPA to regulate \nchemicals \u201cto the extent necessa ry so that [they] no longer pr esent[] [unreasonable] risk.\u201d216 If \nEPA has not considered aggregate exposures to  determine the full extent of a chemical\u2019s \nunreasonable risks, then it will not have the in formation it needs during risk management to \nensure that such risks are eliminated. For in stance, someone may be exposed to unreasonable \ncancer risk from both the ingest ion of TCEP-contaminated fish and the inhalation of TCEP from \ntheir home insulation.

EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Sus ceptibility of People Who Are Exposed to \nTCEP and Other Toxic Chemicals That Contribute to Cumulative Health Risks \n EPA also fails to evaluate as potentially  exposed or susceptib le subpopulations people \nwho experience \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to ha rm from TCEP exposures because of their \ncumulative exposures to multiple ch emicals and non-chem ical stressors.218 Like the failure to \nconsider aggregate exposures, this  omission violates not only TSCA \u2019s mandate to evaluate risks \nto potentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulations but also the requirement to conduct risk \nevaluations using the \u201cb est available science.\u201d219 The National Academies ha ve repeatedly called \nfor the consideration of cumulative exposures in chemical risk eval uations, explaining that \u201cit is \ndifficult to imagine any risk assessment in which it would not be important to understand the \neffects of coexposures to agents or  stressors that have similar [mode s of action] . . . or to identify \ncharacteristics of the affected populations that could contribute to vulnerability to a given \nexposure.\u201d220 More recently, the National Acade mies called on agencies to \u201cmove beyond \nsource-by-source and pollutant-by-pollutant . . . risk assessment a nd toward a fuller \ncharacterization of the cumulative and potential ly synergistic health risks from multiple \nenvironmental and social stress ors that disproportionately imp act communities of color\u201d and \neconomically insecure communities.221 Similarly, the SACC has characterized cumulative \nexposure assessment as \u201ca necessary step \u201d in the TSCA risk evaluation process.222 EPA itself \nadmits that \u201cwithout considering the cumulative risk of chemicals,  the Agency\u2019s risk mitigation \nmay not fully be able to consider the public-h ealth implications of va rious risk management \noptions for reducing exposure.\u201d223 \nYet EPA makes no effort to address cumulative exposures and risks in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, despite available evidence of such risks.

Similarly, studi es have shown cumulative risks \nfrom co-exposures to TCEP and microplastics, which exceed the risks associated with TCEP \nalone.226 EPA did not consider those cumulative ex posures and the resulting increase in \nsusceptibility and risk.   \nNor did EPA evaluate cumulative risks fro m exposures to TCEP and other flame \nretardants. For instance, TCEP is an impurity in the flame-retardant mixture V6, and the two \nflame retardants are frequen tly detected in the same pr oducts and environmental media.227 While \nEPA considered exposures to TCEP from the use of products containing V 6, it never assessed the \ncumulative effects of those flame retardants together. TCEP also  is found alongs ide other flame \nretardants\u2014including PBDEs and other organophos phate ester flame retardants like TCPP and \nTDCPP\u2014in household dust, water, and other environmental media.228 Many of those flame \nretardants are associat ed with the same types of harm as TCEP,229 meaning people who are \nexposed to other flame retardants will be more su sceptible to harm from their TCEP exposures.  \nEPA has acknowledged the cumulative effects fro m other organophosphate chemicals, such as \norganophosphate pesticides.230 Organophosphate ester flame retardan ts are \u201cstructu rally similar\u201d \n \n224 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 333 (\u201c In vitro  data on co-exposure with benzo-a-pyrene \nshowed increased impacts on inflamma tion and proliferation pathways.\u201d). \n225 Youjian Zhang et al., Combined Effect of Tris(2-chlor oethyl)phosphate and Benzo (a) pyrene \non the Release of IL-6 and IL-8 from HepG2 Cells Via the EGFR-ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway , 7 \nRoyal Soc\u2019y Chem.

EPA Understates TCEP Exposures a nd Risks to Tribal Populations \nWe strongly support EPA\u2019s identifi cation of tribal popul ations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u201d  for purposes of the TCEP risk evaluation.232 As reflected in the draft \nrisk evaluation and elaborated below, TSCA\u2019s de finition of \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d indisputably includes tribal populations , who consistently face \u201cgreater risk than \nthe general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or \nmixture\u201d because of both \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater susceptibility.\u201d233 Yet, until now, EPA \nfailed to identify tribal populations as a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation \nrequiring particularized consider ation in risk evaluation and ri sk management. In taking the \ncritical step of identifying tribal populations as a higher- risk subpopulation, EPA correctly \nrecognizes that tribal populations \u2019 \u201cintricate connection to the la nd and . . . distinctive lifeways \nand cultures . . . create many unique exposure scen arios that can expose tr ibal members to higher \ndoses of contaminants in the environment.\u201d234  \nHowever, in the draft risk evaluation for TCEP, EPA failed to follow through on this \ninsight by comprehensively asse ssing the factors that increase tribal popul ations\u2019 exposure to\u2014\nand susceptibility to harm from\u2014TCEP. Indee d, \u201cEPA did not evaluate\u201d the heightened \nexposures associated with \u201cactivities that are uni que to tribal populations\u201d and \u201cquantitatively \nevaluated only the tribal fish ingestion pa thway for TCEP because of data limitations.\u201d235 As EPA \nacknowledges, this approach \u201coverlooks many other unique exposure scenarios\u201d236 and \nultimately understates th e risks TCEP presents to  tribal populations. To sa tisfy TSCA, in the final \nTCEP risk evaluation EPA must utilize all readil y available information to characterize tribal \npopulations\u2019 exposures and susceptibilities, as well as appropriately c onservative assumptions \nand uncertainty factors wh ere data are limited.  \nAmong other factors that increase TCEP e xposures in tribal populations, EPA must \naccount for the impact of solid waste disposal pr actices in tribal comm unities. As described \nsupra  Point III.B, EPA\u2019s failure to adequately characterize TCEP releases and exposures \nassociated with disposal led EPA to broadly unde rstate exposure and risks to human and wildlife \n \n231 Jiawen Yang et al., A Review of a Class of Emerging Contaminants: The Classification, \nDistribution, Intensity of Consumption, Synthesi s Routes, Environmental Effects and Expectation \nof Pollution Abatement to Organophosphate Flame Retardants (OPFRs) , 20 Int\u2019l J.

This concern is particularly acute with respect to tribal  populations. Substandard \nlandfill infrastructure, open dumps, and open bur ning of solid waste in many rural tribal \ncommunities increase those comm unities\u2019 exposures to TCEP as well as to the highly toxic \nbyproducts that result from incomplete combustion of  TCEP-containing wastes.237 In addition, \nmany members of tribal  populations\u2014whether in the lowe r-48 or Alaskan Arctic\u2014live in \nregions with very cold, long wi nters that lead them to spe nd more time indoors, often in \nresidential environments with  older furniture, carpeting, a nd building materials that are \nassociated with higher releases of TCEP and other toxic chemicals to  the indoor environment.238 \nSeveral additional factors that EPA overlooke d particularly increase TCEP exposures and \nrisks among Arctic Indigenous People. \u201cIndi genous peoples in the far north are \ndisproportionately exposed to conta minants as a result of global atmospheric transport\u201d as well \nas \u201ctraditional subsistence diets rich in marine  mammals which are known to contain high levels \n \n237 See, e.g. , Ian L.

In the fina l risk evaluation, EPA \nmust address these factors to deve lop an assessment of TCEP exposur es in tribal populations that \nreflects real-world conditions.  \nRegarding tribal fish consumption, we st rongly support EPA\u2019s recognition that fish \nconsumption rates in many trib al communities can significantly increase exposure to TCEP.244 \nFurther, EPA correctly recognized  that \u201ccurrent fish consumpti on rates [in trib al communities] \nare suppressed by contamination, degradation, or loss of access\u201d  to subsistence species and \nappropriately utilized available data on \u201cheritag e rates\u201d of fish cons umption within tribal \ncommunities, as well as current rates, to characterize exposure.245  \nAt the same time, there are se veral flaws in EPA\u2019s assessme nt of TCEP exposures from \nfish consumption in tribal communities that EPA should correct in the fina l risk evaluation.

Elsewhere in the risk evaluati on, EPA consistently utilizes both \n50th and 95th percentile exposure values to estimate TCEP exposures to th e general population \nand to workers who, like tr ibal populations, experience heightened exposure.246 And there are \nreadily available data reflecting 95th percentile fish ingestion ra tes in tribal populations. For \nexample, Harper et al. 2007 cites a 95th percentile fish ingestion rate of 798 g/day for the \nSuquamish Tribe.247 Second, even if it were appropriate to utilize only me an fish ingestion rates, \nthe value EPA utilized to characterize mean cu rrent/suppressed tribal fi sh consumption rates\u2014\n216 g/day\u2014is too low. EPA\u2019s Exposure Factors Handbook  provides a mean fish ingestion rate \nfor an Alaska Native Nation of 770 g/day.248 A 1999 study by Walker a nd Pritchard reports an \ningestion rate of 650 g/day for subsistence fishers in the Yaka ma Tribe, based on actual use \nbetween 1950 to 1971.249 EPA provides no basis for disregar ding these substa ntially higher \nreported rates. Third, as discussed above, EPA unde restimates environmenta l releases of TCEP \nand resulting concentrations of TCEP in fis h, which leads EPA to further understate TCEP \nexposures from fish consump tion in tribal communities.250 Fourth, although EPA calculated \nTCEP exposures from fish consumption using a high and low bioaccumulation factor (\u201cBAF\u201d) of \n2,198 L/kg and 109 L/kg, respectively,251 EPA only utilized the low BAF \u201cto determine \nunreasonable risk.\u201d252 EPA offers no explanation for disc arding the higher BAF at the risk \ncharacterization stage, which generated si gnificantly less severe risk calculations.253  \nFinally, EPA did not consider aggregate or cu mulative chemical exposur es affecting tribal \npopulations nor account for increase d susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposures among tribal \npopulations due to psychosocial stressors such as poverty, crowded and/ or substandard housing \nconditions, health care ine quity, and discrimination.254 Further, while EPA acknowledged that \ntribal populations\u2019 access to subsistence fish sp ecies is severely constrained, EPA did not \nconsider the effect that reduced  access to fish and other traditi onal foods has on nutrition, health, \n \n246 See, e.g. , Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 170, 221, 232. \n247 Harper et al.

EP A must correct these \ndeficiencies in the final risk ev aluation to accurately characterize exposures and risks in tribal \npopulations and ensure that EPA\u2019s forthcoming ri sk management rule for TCEP will include all \nmeasures that are necessary to  eliminate the unreasonable risk s tribal populations face.   \nD. EPA Fails to Calculate TCEP\u2019s Increased Ri sks to Truck Drivers, Students Residing \nin Dormitories, and Firefighters. \nEPA also overlooks increased TCEP exposures  of several other pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations. \nFirst, TCEP is used in automotive foam, 255 posing increased risks to long-haul truck \ndrivers and others who spend more time in vehi cles than the general population. TCEP is also \nused in mattresses and carpets, with greater  exposures from \u201cextremely worn carpets.\u201d256 Long-\nhaul truck drivers spend far more time inside ve hicles than the general population, and they are \nmore likely to sleep in their vehicle cabs.257   \nBut EPA never considered the in creased risks that truck driv ers\u2014a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u2014expe rience from their \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP.258 Instead, EPA \nsolely evaluates the risks that TCEP in automo tive and furniture foam presents to the general \npublic, who EPA assumes will be exposed for no more than one hour per day and no more than \n73 days per year.259 Those assumptions underestimate risks to the general population (including \npeople who have long, daily commute s in their cars), and are plai nly inapplicable to truckers \nwho can exceed EPA\u2019s annual exposure estimate  in a span of one to two weeks.   \n EPA also fails to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks to firefighters, despite identifying them as a \npotentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulation. EPA acknowledge s that \u201cfirefighters have \nelevated TCEP exposures as a re sult of firefigh ting activities,\u201d 260 including the inhalation of \nTCEP that is aerosolized from products and building materials when they burn.

Using that info rmation, EPA should calculate TCEP \u2019s risks to firefighters.   \nFinally, EPA must consider TCEP\u2019s risks to students in dormitories and other student \nhousing, which are more likely to contain older or  second-hand furniture and less likely to have \nvacuum cleaners that limit the accumulation of dust . High levels of TCEP have been detected in \ndust in student dorms and common areas , with measurements up to 32,000 ng/g.265 TCEP levels \nin one dorm room exceeded Califor nia\u2019s risk-based soil screening standards, indicating potential \nrisk.266 Yet EPA fails to consider that data in the draft risk evaluation, a nd it does not evaluate \nstudents\u2019 increased exposures to and risks from TCEP. \nVII. EPA Has Not Adequately Assessed th e Risks TCEP Poses to Wildlife \nAs EPA acknowledges, it has coequal oblig ations under TSCA to determine whether \nTCEP \u201cpresents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. \u201d267 Yet in multiple \nrespects, EPA\u2019s assessment of the risks TCEP poses to wildlife is incomplete, does not \nconsistently incorporate and reflect the best avai lable science, and violates TSCA. We urge EPA \nto correct the deficiencies outlined below in the final risk evaluation. \nA. EPA Unlawfully Omitted Conditions of Use, Exposure Pathways, and Exposure \nSources from Its Assessment of  Wildlife Exposures to TCEP \nAt the outset, EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s environmental risks does not satisfy TSCA \nbecause EPA failed to determine the environmental risks associated with multiple conditions of \nuse268 and, for many others, provided only a cursor y discussion that dismissed environmental \n \n261 Id. \n262 Id.  \n263 Id. \n264 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a). \n265 Dodson et al.

For exam ple, to justify its failure to determine the \nenvironmental risks associated with TCEP releases from consumer products, EPA asserts that \n\u201c[c]onsumer releases to the environment are antici pated to be less than oc cupational releases, and \nwastewater concentrations from manufacturing, commercial and pr ocessing [conditions of use] \nwere shown to be significantly lower than acu te and chronic [concentrations of concern]\u201d \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.270 It is difficult to underst and how EPA can make this \nclaim about the magnitude of TCEP  releases from consumer products  since it failed to estimate \nthose releases. Indeed, EPA\u2019s observation elsewhere in the draft risk evaluation that \u201c[l]aundry \nwastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastewater treatment plant influent and \nsubsequently to the aquatic envi ronment\u201d appears to contradict the Agency\u2019s justification for \nwriting off consumer product releases.271 Further, even if EPA were  correct that environmental \nreleases from consumer products ar e less than releases from other conditions of use, that would \nnot excuse EPA from fully characterizing and acc ounting for those releases. As discussed above,  \nin the context of assessing human health risk s EPA has recognized that \u201cin developing a \ncomprehensive risk estimate for a chemical s ubstance, it is the Agen cy\u2019s responsibility to \nconsider the aggregation of what  may be lower individual exposu res from individual conditions \nof use and routes of exposure.\u201d272 This conclusion applies equa lly to EPA\u2019s assessments of \nenvironmental risk and underscores that EPA ma y not write off exposures associated with a \nspecific condition of use on the basis that they ma y be less than those asso ciated with another. \nAs EPA recently acknowledged in its proposed amendments to the regulations governing \nTSCA risk evaluations, it also lacks discretion to disregard k nown pathways of TCEP exposure \n \ncondition of use \u201cseparately from the risks already estimated for other relevant [conditions of \nuse]\u201d); id. at 364 (\u201cEPA is unable to determine if dis posal contributes to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable \nrisk.\u201d). \n269 See, e.g., id.  at 147 (explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures to TCEP \nassociated with industrial and commercial use of aerospace equipm ent and products but \n\u201cexpect[s]\u201d these conditions of use \u201cto have lower risk than the qua ntified scenarios\u201d); id. at 148 \n(explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures associated with consumer use \nand disposal of articles cont aining TCEP but stating without support that these releases are \n\u201canticipated to be less than  occupational releases\u201d); id. at 363 (asserting that , for most conditions \nof use, \u201cthe Agency had limited data available an d was not able to fully quantify risks to the \nenvironment\u201d). \n270 Id. at 148. \n271 Id. at 75. \n272 88 Fed.

Similarly, \u201c[d]irect exposure of TCEP to aquatic receptors via \nbiosolids was not asse ssed quantitatively.\u201d275 These omissions violate TSCA, which does not \ngive EPA discretion to write off exposure pa thways that it judges\u2014here, without even \nconducting a complete analysis\u2014contribute relativel y less to overall risk. Further, EPA will not \nbe able to determine what measures are needed  at the risk management stage to eliminate \nTCEP\u2019s environmental risks if it has ignored importan t segments of exposure and risk at the \nevaluation stage. Wildlife exposur e to TCEP via biosolids app lication is undoubtedly important; \nas EPA found, \u201c[d]ue to its persistence, it is li kely that dissolved TCEP will eventually reach \nsurface water via runoff after the land application of biosolids.\u201d276 \nIt also appears that EPA\u2019s an alysis of wildlife ingestion exposure did not consider the \ncontribution of ingested  plastic debris and microplastics.  Many wildlife species, including \nloggerhead sea turtles protected by the ESA,277 are chronically exposed to organophosphate \nflame retardants such as TCEP and other toxic chemicals through ingestion of plastic.278 \u201cSea \nbirds also ingest microplastics voluntarily,\u201d and peer-reviewed re search indicates that \u201cingested \nplastic debris [i]s a major source of plastic additives for sea birds.\u201d279 Further, in recent studies \n\u201c[t]he concentration of plastic additives in su rface waters and the a bundance of microplastic \nparticles were not correlated, implying that th ey are not necessarily good indicators for each \nother in this compartment.\u201d280 Accordingly, EPA\u2019s consideration of TCEP concentrations in \nsurface water and prey species do es not substitute for analyzing wildlife e xposures to TCEP from \ningested plastic. EPA must address this source of ingestion exposure in the final risk evaluation.   \n \n273 See id.  at 74,294 (stating that \u201cexclud[ing] certai n exposure pathways\u201d from a risk evaluation \n\u201cconflict[s] with the plain language of the law to evaluate chemical substances under the known, \nintended or reasonably foreseen circumstances asso ciated with the full lifecycle of the chemical \nsubstance\u201d and \u201cprevent[s] consideration of re levant exposure informat ion . . . in spite of \nstatutory requirements that the Agency base its decisions on the best  available science\u201d). \n274 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 94; see also id.  at 119, 138. \n275 Id. at 138. \n276 Id.  \n277 See NOAA Fisheries, Loggerhead Turtle , https://www.fisheries.noaa .gov/species/loggerhead-\nturtle  (last visited Jan. 25, 2024) (identifying distinct  population segments liste d as threatened or \nendangered under the Endangered Species Act). \n278 Berta Sala et al., First Study on the Presence of Plastic Additives in Loggerhead Sea Turtles \n(Caretta caretta ) from the Mediterranean Sea , 283 Env\u2019t Pollution Art No. 117108, at 1\u20132, 4\u20136 \n(2021); see also  Fauser et al.

EPA\u2019s Environmental Hazard Thresholds Are Not Sufficiently Protective of Aquatic \nSpecies  \nEPA\u2019s environmental hazard thre sholds are insufficiently pr otective of aquatic life. EPA \ncalculated a concentration of concern of 55.9 parts-per-bil lion (\u201cppb\u201d) for chronic TCEP \nexposure among aquatic species, based on a 14-day study of growth and de velopment effects in \nJapanese medaka, a fish species.281 However, a 2021 peer reviewed study (Zhao et al. 2021) \ndocumented adverse effects on juvenile yellow  catfish exposed to substantially lower \nconcentrations of TCEP over 30 days, incl uding significant adverse effects on growth, \nhistological changes to gills, and altered gene expression.282 Histological changes to gill cells \noccurred at doses as low as 1 \u03bcg/L, equivalent to 1 ppb, while adverse effects on growth and \nbody weight occurred at doses as low as 10 ppb.283 And at 100 ppb TCEP exposure, \u201cthe survival \nrate of juvenile yellow catfish . . . was signifi cantly decreased compared with the control after \n30-day exposure, which implied th at high environmental concentra tions of TCEP could threaten \nthe survival of juvenile yellow catfish.\u201d284 Based on this study and uti lizing the assessment factor \nof ten that EPA applied to calcu late its concentration of conc ern, Zhao et al. would support a \nconcentration of concern as low as 0.1 ppb (based  on histological changes to gill cells) or 1 ppb \n(based on growth effects). It does not appear th at EPA considered this study in developing the \ndraft risk evaluation, and it must do so in revising the draft a nd appropriately strengthen its \nhazard thresholds to protect aquatic life\u2014i ncluding the most sensitive species.  \nC. EPA Has Not Adequately Evaluated the Ri sks TCEP Presents to Birds, Marine \nMammals, Threatened and Endangered Sp ecies, and Other Species of Special \nConcern \nThe draft risk evaluation indi cates that EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s hazards to aquatic \norganisms and mammals rests on st udies in fish (for aquatic orga nisms) and mice and rats (for \nmammals),285 and that its risk characteri zation for terrestrial vertebra tes is based on an analysis \nof trophic transfer expos ures to American mink.286 EPA has not justified its failure to assess \nhazards and risks to other species in characterizing TCEP\u2019s risks to wildlife. EPA also failed to \nincorporate available literature and data in the dr aft risk evaluation that ar e relevant to assessing \nrisks to birds, marine mammals, and threatened  and endangered species. EPA must correct these \nomissions in the final risk evaluation to satisfy TS CA and ensure that its risk determinations and \n \n281 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104, 107. \n282 Yixin Zhao et al., Effects of Tris (2-chl oroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) on Survival, Growth, \nHistological Changes and Gene Expressions in Juvenile Yellow Catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco , \n87 Env\u2019t Toxicology & Phar macology Art No. 103699 (2021). \n283 Id. 7; see also id.  at 1, 3\u20134 (describing adverse effects on growth at 10 ppb TCEP exposure). \n284 Id. at 5. \n285 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104\u201306. \n286 Id. at 144. \n44 \n subsequent risk management ru le will protect wildlife species whose life histories and/or \nvulnerable conservation status  place them at greater ri sk from exposure to TCEP.287 \nAt the outset, EPA has not justified its relian ce on such a narrow set of wildlife species to \ncharacterize TCEP\u2019s environmental hazards. EPA\u2019 s ecological risk assessment guidance directs \nthe Agency to consider multiple criteria in se lecting \u201cassessment endpoin ts\u201d for ecological risk \nassessment, including a species \u2019 \u201c(1) ecological relevance, (2) susceptibility to known or \npotential stressors, and (3) re levance to management goals.\u201d288 \u201cOf these, ecological relevance \nand susceptibility are essential for selecting assessment endpoin ts that are scientifically \ndefensible.\u201d289 EPA has not justified its exclusive reli ance on fish and mouse/rat studies under \nthese criteria. \nFurther, EPA has not considered all reasonably available information that is relevant to \nevaluating TCEP\u2019s risks to species of special  ecological and conser vation concern\u2014including \nbut not limited to marine mammals. Aside from ci ting three studies reporti ng lipid concentrations \nof TCEP in aquatic mammals,290 the draft risk evaluation does not  discuss exposure or risks to \nthese species. This omission must be addresse d in the final risk ev aluation. TCEP and other \norganophosphates are widely dete cted in marine mammals,291 and a recent study documented \nsignificant biomagnification of the TCEP metabo lite bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (\u201cBCEP\u201d) in \nmarine mammals.292 Further, \u201c[m]arine mammals, such as  cetaceans and pinnipeds, are widely \nacknowledged as sentinel species to assess marine contamination status and health of marine \necosystem[s] due to being long-te rm inhabitants and long-lived apex predators at high trophic \nlevels in the marine ecosystem.\u201d293 As a result of their long life  spans, high trophic position in \naquatic food webs; and \u201cthick subcutaneous li pid layer (i.e. blubber),\u201d in which persistent \npollutants can accumulate, their exposure to and ri sks from persistent pollutants such as TCEP \n \n287 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(F)(i) (requ iring EPA to \u201cintegrate and assess available information on \nhazards and exposures . . . that is  relevant to specific risks of in jury to . . . the environment\u201d). \n288 EPA, EPA/630/R-95/002F, Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment  30 (Apr. 1998) \n(\u201cGuidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/site s/default/files/2014-\n11/documents/eco_r isk_assessment1998.pdf .  \n289 Id. \n290 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 96. \n291 See, e.g., Mengqin Chen et al., Tissue Distribution and Trophi c Transfer of Organophosphate \nTriesters and Diesters in Thr ee Marine Mammals of the Liaodong Bay and the Northern Yellow \nSea, 461 J.

In its avian exposure assessme nt,  EPA discusses only two studies \nmeasuring TCEP concentrations in bird eggs,296 disregarding a recent study, Choo et al. 2022, \nthat reported high concentrations  of TCEP in black gull eggs and a 377 percent increase in \nmeasured TCEP concentrations between 2012 to 2018.297 Further, it does not appear that EPA \nintegrated the available data on TCEP concentrati ons in bird eggs into its risk characterization.298 \nThis is problematic because the sensitivity of wildlife to chemical stressors \u201ccan be related to the \nlife stage of an organism when exposed to a st ressor,\u201d and \u201c[f]requently , young animals are more \nsensitive to stressors than adults.\u201d299  \nRegarding hazards to avian species, EPA asse rts that \u201conly a single high-quality study \nwas available for the American ke strel with no hazard value for the avian insectivore within [the] \nanalysis.\u201d300 This approach is not adequate to accura tely characterize TCEP exposures and risks \nto birds. The high TCEP concentrations in bl ack gull eggs reported in Choo et al. 2022 may \nreflect the study\u2019s assessment of birds that feed primarily on fi sh since, as EPA acknowledges, \n\u201cTCEP has the ability to quickly bioaccumulate in  fish tissue if it is exposed to high TCEP \nconcentration[s] in the surroundi ng water for a period of time.\u201d301 In the final risk evaluation, \nEPA should consider exposure and risk to fish-e ating birds.

EPA Must Assess Aggregate and Cumulative Risks to Wildlife  \nFinally, to satisfy its statutory mandate to u tilize the best available science, EPA\u2019s final \nrisk evaluation for TCEP must consider aggr egate and cumulative exposures and risks to \nwildlife.311 It is axiomatic that \u201corganisms do not live in single-stress situations. Rather they are \nconstantly exposed to a series of differen t stressors, both chemical and non-chemical.\u201d312 EPA\u2019s \nrisk evaluation cannot ignore this reality. \nRegarding aggregate exposures to TCEP among wildlife, EPA acknowledged but refused \nto consider them.313 This leads EPA to underestimate wildli fe exposures and risks and must be \ncorrected in the final risk evaluation. \nEPA likewise must correct its failure to consider  cumulative exposures and risks among \nwildlife. As NMFS has observed, \u201c[m] ixture effects case studies that have examined effects from \nthe interaction of [persistent orga nic pollutants] . . . demonstrate th at the interaction of pollutants \nis primarily synergistic and toxicity is enhance d, especially when the exposure to the chemical \nmixture is at a critical developmental growth period.\u201d314 Accordingly, NMFS has criticized \necological risk assessments that  focus on \u201chigh doses of [single] contaminants,\u201d which \u201cmay \nunderestimate risk . . . because some contaminan ts can interact at doses below the no observed \neffect concentrations (NOECs) and produce significant effects.\u201d315 Consideration of additive and \nsynergistic effects is particularly important in  the risk evaluation at hand given the extensive \nliterature documenting wildli fe species\u2019 co-exposures to TCEP along with other \norganophosphates, PBDEs, PCBs, phthalates, and additional contaminants that are known to \nexert common adverse health effects on animals.316 Further, there are established methods and \n \n310 See Sala et al.

EPA has historically supported the use of a 1-in-\n1,000,000 cancer risk threshold under  TSCA, consistent with th e level used in other EPA \nprograms.319 In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA replaces that clear benchmark with \n\u201ca range of extra cancer risk from 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] to 1\u00d710\u22126 [1-in-1,000,000].\u201d320 There is \nno legal or scientific justification for that change. \n EPA sets the threshold for unreasonable o ccupational cancer risks at the less protective \nend of that range, claiming that, \u201c[c]onsistent wi th [National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health  (\u201cNIOSH\u201d)] guidance, u nder TSCA EPA typically applies a 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] \nbenchmark for occupational scenar ios in industrial and commercial  work environments subject \nto [Occupational Safety and Health  Administration]  requirements.\u201d321 This justification \nmisinterprets NIOSH guidelines, which describe 1-in-10,000 not as a target cancer risk level but \nrather \u201ca starting point for continually reduci ng exposures in order to reduce the remaining \nrisk.\u201d322 NIOSH goes on to say that \u201cfor most car cinogens, there is no known safe level of \nexposure\u201d and NIOSH will continue  to recommend that employers  reduce worker exposure to \noccupational carcinogens as much as possibl e through the hierarchy of controls, most \n \n317 See Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, Inc. et al., Comments on Draft Proposed Principles of \nCumulative Risk Assessment Under the Toxic Substances Control Ac t, at 29\u201330 (Apr. 28, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/co mment/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2022-0918-0035  (collecting examples). \n318 Gina Solomon et al., Integrating Environmenta l Justice into Public Health: Approaches for \nUnderstanding Cumulative Impacts , 5 Frontiers Pub.

EPA vaguely states that \u201c[e]xposure-related \nconsiderations ( e.g., duration, magnitude, popula tion exposed) can affect\u201d the reasonableness of \ncancer risk, but it does not explain how it will ap ply and weigh those considerations, opening the \ndoor to arbitrary and unprinc ipled risk determinations.328  \n Finally, the draft risk evaluation does not even adhere to EPA\u2019s own, weakened cancer \nrisk thresholds. EPA states that five conditions of use \u201cwere preliminary [sic] determined not to \ncontribute to the unreasonable ris k,\u201d including consumer uses of \u201cbuilding/construction materials \n\u2013 insulation.\u201d329 But according to EPA\u2019s risk calculati ons, \u201c[i]nhalation from insulation presents \nthe highest lifetime cancer risk (4.50\u00d710\u22122)\u201d to consumers.330 This calculated cancer risk of 4.5-\nin-100 is more than 450 times gr eater than the EPA\u2019s least protective, 1-in-10,000 unreasonable \n \n323 Id. \n324 Id.; see also  TSCA Sci.

EPA Should Not Calculate Existing Chemic al Exposure Limits During the Risk \nEvaluation   \n The purpose of a TSCA risk evaluation is to determine whether a chemical presents \nunreasonable risk that triggers the need for re gulation, not to prejudge potential regulatory \noptions. Congress separated EPA\u2019s decisions abou t how to manage unreasonable risk into a \ndistinct regulatory proce ss that follows the completion of a risk evaluation.\n331 Indeed, TSCA \nsection 6(c) enumerates factors that EPA \u201csha ll consider\u201d during the ri sk management process,332  \nwhich include \u201ccosts [and] other nonrisk fact ors\u201d that EPA is expressly precluded from \nconsidering in a TSCA risk evaluation.333 \nYet EPA blurs the line between risk eval uation and risk management by improperly \ncalculating Existing Chemical Exposure Limits (\u201cECELs\u201d)\u2014a risk mana gement tool\u2014in its \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation. Appendix N of the dr aft risk evaluation contains a \u201cDraft [ECEL]\u201d \nthat \u201cmay be used to support risk manageme nt efforts for TCEP under TSCA section 6(a).\u201d334  \nEPA even evaluates whether TCEP would be dete ctable at the draft ECEL value using existing \nair sampling methods, a \u201cnonrisk factor[]\u201d that EPA is barred from considering at this stage.335 \nNotably, EPA does not discuss any other risk mana gement approach in its  risk evaluation. For \ninstance, it does not consider whether engineering controls would eliminate TCEP\u2019s \nunreasonable risks to workers; whet her pretreatment requirements or other dispos al regulations \nwould address TCEP\u2019s disposal related risks; or whether a ba n on the manufacturing, processing, \nand commercial distribution of TCEP would be  more effective than EPA\u2019s draft ECEL. The \nanalysis of potential ECELs in the draft risk  evaluation suggests that EPA has impermissibly \nprejudged potential risk management measures, well before the risk management process has \neven begun. \nIn addition to being premature, EPA\u2019s draf t ECELs are underprotec tive and inconsistent \nwith TSCA\u2019s requirement to regulate TCEP \u201cto the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents [unreasonable] risk.\u201d336 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL of 0.09 mg/m3 TCEP, measured over an \neight-hour time-weighted average,337 falls short of that statutor y requirement. EPA determined \nthe draft ECEL based on the level of TCEP expos ures that are estimated to keep occupational \n \n331 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a)\u2013(b). \n332 Id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2). \n333 Id. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A) (prohibiting EPA from consider ing \u201ccosts or other nonrisk factors\u201d during \nthe risk evaluation stage); id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2)(A)(iv)(II) (r equiring EPA to consider \u201cthe costs and \nbenefits of the proposed and final regulatory  action\u201d during the risk  management stage). \n334 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation  at 568. \n335 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A). \n336 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n337 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 568. \n51 \n cancer risks at or below 1-in-10,000,338 a benchmark that accepts far greater occupational cancer \nrisks than EPA has found acceptable for consumers or the general public. Further, in calculating \nthat level, EPA assumes that workers would be  exposed to TCEP from a single exposure route \n(inhalation), via a single condition of use, without any out-of-w ork exposures from TCEP in their \nhomes or environment.339 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL would thus fail to eliminate unreasonable risks to \nworkers who are exposed to TCEP on and off the job, or, for example, fro m dermal contact as \nwell as inhalation. EPA also fails  to address how it plans to implement and enforce an ECEL \nwhen, by its own account, EPA has no idea where TCEP is manufactured and used. However, \nthose questions and others should be addressed during the TSCA ri sk management process, when \na proposed ECEL can be compared to other risk  management options. In  the meantime, draft \nECELs have no place in the TCEP risk evaluation.  \nX.  EPA Should Publish a Non-Technical Su mmary of the Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation \nThat Adheres to EPA Guidance and Best Practices on Risk Communication   \nThe TSCA risk evaluation rule requires \u201cEPA . . . to provide public access to . . . [a] \nnontechnical summary of the risk evaluation.\u201d340 The non-technical summa ry must allow people \nwho are adversely impacted by the chemical undergoing evaluation, su ch as workers, consumers, \nand residents of fenceline communities, to readily  identify what potential risks they face and how \nEPA calculated those risks. However, EPA did not provide a non-technical summary alongside \nthe draft TCEP risk evaluation. Th e closest that EPA comes to such  a summary is an overview of \nkey points at the beginning of a select number of chapters.341 Even then, these chapter summaries \nuse technical jargon and are difficult for the ge neral public to understand, and do not suffice as a \nsubstitute for the non-techni cal summary required by TSCA\u2019s  implementing regulations.342  \nEPA should have published a non-technical summary alongside the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation. Doing so would allow workers, co nsumers, and communitie s impacted by TCEP \nexposures to not only better unders tand the results of the TCEP risk  evaluation, but also to better \nengage in the comment period, whic h is the only formal opportunity  to express their views on the \nTCEP risk evaluation. By foregoing a non-technical summary at the draft risk evaluation stage, \nEPA fails to effectively communicate the results of the draft TCEP risk evaluation to people \nexposed to the chemical and fa cilitate their enga gement in the public  comment process. \n In addition to publishing a non-technical  summary, EPA should have conducted \nmeaningful outreach to tribes, fenceline co mmunities, labor unions , and other exposed \n \n338 Id. at 569. \n339 Id.  \n340 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.51(d). \n341 See, e.g.,  Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 39. \n342 See, e.g., id. at 157 (\u201cFor OESs that do not have data , EPA used relevant generic scenario \nand/or emission scenario documents to identify worker activities and exposure routes that are \nreasonably expected to occur.

In order to achieve effective risk \ncommunication, EPA must engage multiple impacted groups early in the risk evaluation process, \nas opposed to the end, and solicit th eir feedback on what informati on should be included in the \nnon-technical summaries, as well as the preferre d form and manner in wh ich the information is \ndelivered.344 \n Furthermore, we advise EPA to, at a minimum, adhere to the following risk \ncommunication principles recommended by EPA in the past and by the In terstate Technology and \nRegulatory Council (\u201cITRC\u201d).\n345 EPA should simplify its langu age in order to make non-\ntechnical summaries more digestible, and it should refrain from using any legal or scientific jargon. As mentioned above, in the chapter su mmaries included in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, EPA uses scientific, legal, and t echnical terms with which a layperson may be \nunfamiliar.\n346 EPA guidance from 2007 on risk communicat ion advises \u201ctranslat[ing] technical \nterms . . . into everyday language the public can ea sily understand,\u201d \u201cavoid[ ing] . . . jargon,\u201d and \n\u201cwrit[ing] short sentences.\u201d347 Similarly, the ITRC publishe d guidance regarding risk \ncommunication advises that writing for fact shee ts should be at \u201ca sixt h-grade comprehension \nlevel.\u201d348 EPA should do the same in its non-techni cal summary of the risk evaluation. \n \nEPA should also organize its summaries in a way that is easy fo r readers to process \ninformation. EPA should consider organizing its non-technical summaries in more reader-\n \n343 The recommended outreach to tribes to support effective risk communication is distinct from, \nand not a substitute for, EPA\u2019s obligation to e ngage in meaningful government-to-government \nconsultation with tribes concerni ng the TCEP risk evaluation.  \n344 See Mem. from Richard L.

As mentioned supra , EPA does not have \ninformation on where  TCEP is being released despite having  had more than sufficient time to \ncollect this data. We urge EPA to  collect this informat ion and adopt this pr actice for any future \nrisk evaluations. If EPA lacks this  information, such as is the ca se here, it should still provide \nnon-technical summaries in languag es other than English based on national statistics, such as \nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau, on language s spoken across the United States.  \n  Lastly, the information that EPA conveys through its non-technical  summaries should \ninclude the results that are most  relevant to impacted groups. EP A must provide a plain-language \nsummary of each \u201ccondition of us e\u201d so that fenceline residents, workers, and consumers can \neasily understand what processes or products can expose them to  risk, as opposed to vaguely \ndefined categories. For instance, the draft risk ev aluation says that TCEP is used in \u201cfabric and \ntextile products\u201d and \u201cfoam seating and bedding products,\u201d\n352 but it fails to specify that TCEP \nhas been detected in nursing pill ows, crib mattresses, yoga mats , and other products that people \nuse on a daily basis. We recomme nd that EPA describe the produc ts in which TCEP is found in \nmore accessible and relevant te rms, and also provide a clear and digestible illustration or \ninfographic to help the general public more eas ily understand their sources of exposure. EPA \nshould also strive to convey the results of its risk cal culations in a simple manner, so impacted \ngroups can better understand the degree of risk that they face.    We urge EPA to, at a minimum, publish a non- technical summary that adheres to the best \npractices laid forth above alongside the publishing  of the final TCEP risk evaluation, and going \nforward, to publish a non-technical summary that adheres to best practices for any future draft \nrisk evaluations in order to  increase meaningful engageme nt with impacted groups and \ncommunities.    \n \n349 See Risk Commc\u2019n Workbook at 8 (\u201cUse headings a nd other formatting techniques to provide \na clear and organized structure.); id. at 31 (\u201cMake fact sheets vi sually interesting by using \npictures, graphs, or diagrams to  accompany textual information.\u201d).   \n350 EPA, Fact Sheet, EP A\u2019 s Proposal to Limit PF AS in Drinking Water  (Mar. 2023), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n04/Fact%20Sheet_PFAS_NPWDR_Final_4.4.23.pdf .  \n351 ITRC FAQs.   \n352 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 27. \n54 XI. The SACC Should Have the Opportunity to Review the Draft Risk Evaluation in a\nPanel Peer Review Process With a Broadened Charge\nInstead of a full panel review of the draft TC EP risk evaluation, EPA intends to conduct a\n\u201cletter peer review\u201d in which a small number of SACC members individually review EPA\u2019s \ndraft.353 A letter review involves no public peer review meeting, no de liberation between the \nreviewers, and thus no opportunity for experts from different backgrounds and disciplines to \ndebate points of disagreeme nt and coalesce around common recommendations. For all those \nreasons, letter review is disfavor ed by EPA and by the SACC itself and should not be used for the \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation.   \nEPA\u2019s Peer Review Handbook advises against the use of letter  peer review for \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d like draft TSCA risk evaluations.354 The Handbook defines \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d (\u201cISI\u201d) as \u201cscientific information the agency reasonably can determine \nwill have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private-\nsector decisions.\u201d355 \u201cHighly influential scientific assessm ent\u201d (\u201cHISA\u201d), a s ubset of ISI, is \ndefined as \u201ca scientific assessment that: (i) could have a pot ential impact of more than $500 \nmillion in any year, or (ii) is novel, controversial, or precedent-setting or  has significant \ninteragency interest.\u201d356 TSCA risk evaluations\u2014which are intended to inform regulatory \ndecisions and which frequently i nvolve \u201cnovel\u201d scientif ic issues with \u201csig nificant interagency \ninterest\u201d \u2014are both ISI and HISA.357  The Handbook thus recommends that such risk \nevaluations undergo full panel review: \n[P]anels are preferable for influential products because they tend to bemore deliberative than individual lette r reviews and the reviewers can help\ninform one another. Panels are valuab le when the work product is complex\nand multidisciplinary. Panel peer re view meetings may be open to the\npublic, with opportunities for public comment.\n358\nMembers of the SACC have reached the same  conclusion. The peer reviewers of EPA\u2019s \nQuantitative Human Health Approach to be Applie d in the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2  \nwere highly critical of EPA\u2019s decision to use a letter review process, which they found \u201centirely \ninconsistent with the 40-year hist ory of EPA Science Advisory Pane ls\u201d and contrary to the \u201clegal \n353 Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate; Draft Risk Eval uation Under the Toxic S ubstances Control Act \n(TSCA); Letter Peer Review; Notice of Availabi lity, Public Meeting and Request for Comment, \n88 Fed.

TCEP should not be \nthe first. According to EPA, there are several \u201cn ovel\u201d aspects of the draft TCEP risk evaluation\u2014\nincluding EPA\u2019s approach to estimating aeria l deposition of TCEP, exposures to TCEP in \nbreastmilk, and drinking water cont amination from landfill leachate\u2014that EPA is using \u201cfor the \nfirst time\u201d under TSCA.\n362 Those issues and others would be nefit from the consideration and \ninput of the full SACC. EPA has ample time to schedule and conduc t a panel review of the draft \nTCEP risk evaluation, which can be held virtua lly consistent with EPA\u2019s post-2020 practice. We \nurge EPA to do so.

        "text": "1 \n \n \n \n UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY  \nProposed Rule, National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air \nPollutants: Supplemental Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking , 89 Fed. Reg. \n9088  (February 9 , 2023)  Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 \n \n \n \nCOMMENTS OF  CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS, \nSIERRA CLUB, AND EARTHJUSTICE  \nSubmitted via regulations.gov and e -mail on March 11 , 2024  by Earthjustice  \nBACKGROUND  \n On July 24, 2020, EPA  promulgated a final air toxics rule for Lime \nManufacturing Plants (\u201cLime Kilns\u201d) that the agency knew to be flatly unlawful. \nAlthough the Clean Air Act unambiguously requires \u00a7 112-compliant limits for \neach hazardous air pollutant that a source category e mits and EPA knew that lime \nkilns emit hazardous air pollutants for which its existing \u00a7 112 standards provide \nno emission limits, EPA refused to promulgate the statutorily-required limits. EPA \nsought to justify its action by arguing it \u201cdoes not read CAA section 112(d)(6) as \ndirecting the Agency, as part of or in conjunction with the mandatory 8 -year \ntechnology review, to develop new emission standards to address HAP or  emission \npoints for which standards were not previously promulgated. \u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960, \n44969 (July 24, 2020).  \n Approximately four months before  EPA published that rule, the D.C. Circuit \nhad already rejected the interpretation of \u00a7 112(d)(6) on which EPA purported to \nrely. In Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020), the Court held \u201c[t]he section 112(d)(6) requirement that EPA, when it \nundertakes its eight- year review, revise emission standards \u2018as necessary\u2019 means \n2 \n \n \n \n that EPA must conform them to the basic requisites of \u2018emission standards\u2019 under \nsection 112, including by setting controls on previously unaddressed hazardous air \npollutants.\u201d Id. at 1098.  Nonetheless, f ully aware that its interpretation of the Clean \nAir Act was unlawful, EPA nonetheless chose to rely on it and, indeed, reiterate it \nin refus ing emission limits for the uncontrolled hazardous air pollutants that Lime \nKilns  emit. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44969. EPA\u2019s action demonstrated contempt for the  \npeople the Clean Air Act was enacted to protect, for the Court that had clearly \nrejected the unlawful statutory interpretation EPA advanced, and for Congress, which enacted the statutory requirements that the agency steadfastly refused to \nobey for more than 20 years.  \nSierra Club challenged EPA\u2019s unlawful rule in the D.C. Circuit, Sierra Club \nv. EPA, D.C. Cir. No. 20 -1381 (filed September 22, 2020).  To give EPA a chance \nto correct its violation of the law voluntarily, Sierra Club also filed a petition for \nreconsideration under Clean Air Act \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -\n0065 . \nNotably, EPA promulgated the illegal 2020 air toxics rule for Lime Kilns \nyears after the Clean Air Act required the agency to issue lawful standards, and the agency acted only after a court ordered it to do so. See Blue Ridge Environmental \nDefense League v. Pruitt , 261 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2017) (\u201c BREDL \u201d). In 2021,  \nEPA returned to the district court and admitted that its 2020 rule did not satisfy the \nClean Air Act or even its obligations under the district court\u2019s order to promulgate \nthe overdue rule in BREDL. Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), Joint Motion to Extend Deadlines under Court Order, \nApril 13, 2021, Ex. A . hereto.  EPA sought and obtained consent of plaintiffs and \nthe court in BREDL  for an extension of the deadline to give the agency a chance to \nbring its rule into compliance with the statute.  Id. The deadline for EPA to issue a \nrule that complied with the Clean Air Act and satisfied the district court\u2019s order was extended to February 23, 2023.  \nShortly, before the final rule was due, EPA sought and obtained a second \nextension of the deadline, to August 1, 2023, claiming its \u201canalysis here took \n3 \n \n \n \n longer than expected.\u201d Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), EPA\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Extend Deadline, January \n23, 2023, Ex. B. \nIn July of the same year, EPA sought yet another extension. Requesting  an \nentire yea r of further delay, EPA claimed  \nSome comments challenged underlying assumptions that EPA had \nmade when it decided, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that the proposal would not have \u201ca significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(b). Because EPA can no longer certify that the proposal would not have such effects, \nthe agency now plans to convene a review panel under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n609(b), invite public comments on an initial regulatory flexibility \nanalysis, and issue a final regulatory flexibility analysis to accompany \nthe final rule . See id. \u00a7\u00a7 603- 04.      \nBlue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, D.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), \nEPA\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Extend Deadline, July 20, 2023, Ex. C  (emphasis \nadded) . \n Despite its representations to plaintiffs and the court, EPA used the \nextension not merely to conduct the SBREFA analysis described in its motion but \nto pursue its apparent policy goal of weakening the Lime Kilns rule to benefit industry at the expense of people who are exposed to Lime Kilns\u2019 toxic emissions. \nEPA did not inform  the court or plaintiffs or the court that it was going to propose \nsuch amendments when it obtained consent for the extension  or, indeed, that it was \ngoing to use the time to anything other than conduct SBREFA analysis.  Nor did \nEPA mention that it was engaged in proposing such amendments at any subsequent \npoint before publishing the weakening amendments in the Federal Register.  \n4 \n \n \n \n COMMENTS  \nI. EPA WOULD VIOLATE THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND ACT \nARBITRARILY BY SETTING A \u201cHEALTH-BASED EMISSION LIMIT\u201d FOR HYDROGEN CHLORIDE.  \nEPA seeks comment on a request by the Small Business Advocacy Review \nPanel to set a \u201chealth -based emission limit\u201d (HBEL) for hydrogen chloride (HCl) \nthat is even weaker than the HCl limit EPA proposed. 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9092 \n(February 9, 2024). It is wort h providing some context for EPA\u2019s consideration of \nthis request. \u201c The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the \nenvironment.\u201d https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our -mission -and-what -we-do. Given \nthis mission, one might expect EPA would be an advocate for \u201chuman health and \nthe environment\u201d  and to represent ordinary Americans\u2019 interests in being protected \nfrom toxic pollution  at least as zealously as it represents business owners\u2019 \neconomic interests . As is plainly evidenced by EPA\u2019s biased and one -sided \narguments in favor of the HBEL and EPA \u2019s complete failure to consider or even \nmention the reasons against  issuing one that the agency  articulated and \nsuccessfully defended in its air toxics rule for industrial boilers, see U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d 579, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2016) , the agency has a bandoned or lost track \nof this mission . \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) provides that, \u201c [w]ith respect to pollutants for which \na health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider  such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission \nstandards under this subsection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4). Nothing in the text of \nthis provision authorizes EPA to set limits that are less stringent than those \nrequired by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). To the contrary, the text of the statute indicates that \nCongress intended EPA to consider  health thresholds, where they have been \nestablished, as a factor in making the limits that EPA promulgates under \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) more  stringent. Indeed, by providing that thresholds be \n\u201cconsider[ed]\u201d \u201cwhen establishing emission standards under this subsection ,\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added) , the statutory text indicates that Congress wanted (d)(4) to \nprovide for more stringent standards. Specifically, \u00a7  112(d)(2) provides that \n5 \n \n \n \n standards \u201cpromulgated under this subsection\u201d must meet the stringency \nrequirements in \u00a7 112(d)(2) and (d)(3). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). Because \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) requires the \u201cmaximum\u201d reductions that are achievable \u201cincluding a \nprohibition on emissions where ach ievable,\u201d reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as authorizing \nmore stringent standards is consistent with \u00a7 112(d)(2). Reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as \nallowing standards that are less stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 i.e., that do not \ncomply with these provisions \u2013 is inconsistent with \u00a7 112(d)(4)\u2019s directive to \nconsider health thresholds \u201cwhen establishing emission standards.\u201d Id.    \nIn the past, EPA has invoked a floor statement by then Senator Durenberger  \nas authority for reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as allowing it to set limits that are less \nstringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). In its 1998 rule for pulp and paper \nmills,  for example,  EPA stated  \nWith respect to the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, \nthe authority to set a standard less stringent than maximum achievable \ncontrol  technology is contained in subsection (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and  other non- threshold pollutants, no such  authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act.  \n63 Fed. Reg. 18,754, 18,765 (April 15, 1998) (quoting Environment and Public \nWorks, A  Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at \n876, statement of Senator Durenberger during Senate Debate of October 27, 1990).  \n \n A floor statement does not trump the statutory text. Because the text of \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) does not authorize EPA to set limits less stringent than those required \nby \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 and strongly indicates that Congress intended only that EPA \nconsider more str ingent limits under these provisions \u2013 EPA cannot rely on Senator \nDurenberger\u2019s floor statement for authority to set limits that are less stringent than \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require.  \n  Assuming arguendo  that \u00a7 112(d)(4) does authorize EPA to issue limits that \nless stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require in some circumstances, doing so for HCl \nwould still be unlawful. As EPA itself explains:   \n   \n6 \n \n \n \n The EPA presumptively applies section 112(d)(4) only to HAP\u2019s that \nare not carcinogens because Congress clearly intended that \ncarcinogens be considered nonthreshold pollutants . \u2026 \u201cWith respect \nto the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, the  authority to \nset a standard less stringent than maximum achievable control \ntechnology is contained in subsection  (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and other non- threshold pollutants, no such authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act. \u201d \n63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (quoting Staff of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at 876,  statement of Senator Durenberger \nduring Senate Debate of October 27, 1990) (emphasis added).  EPA has \nnever altered its interpretation of what \u201cCongress clearly intended.\u201d To the \ncontrary, EPA has reiterated it consistently over the last two decades. See, \ne.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 32,006, 32,031 (June 4, 2010); Sierra Club v. EPA, D.C. \nCir. No. 15 -1487 (filed April 28, 2017)  (\u201cEPA Brick Kilns Brief) , Ex. D \nhereto, at 23 (citing 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, 79,639 (December 18, 2014).    \n Notably, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s refusal to set a HBEL for HCl \nbecause, inter alia, it did not \u201cconsider the potential acute or carcinogenic effects \nthat might be caused by HCl exposure.\u201d U.S. Sugar v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 624 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031). Conversely, where EPA sought to \nset a HBEL for HCl, the D.C. Circuit found EPA\u2019s action unlawful because the \nagency failed to carry its burden of showing with \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl \nis not carcinogenic.  Sierra Club v.  EPA, 895 F.3d 1, 10- 11 (D.C. Cir. 2018).   \nIn the supplemental proposal, EPA does not provide substantial evidence \nthat HCl is not carcinogenic or, indeed, even attempt to provide any showing at all. \nFor this reason alone, issuing a HBEL for HCl would be unlawful and arbitrary.  \nEvidently seeking to evade the holding in Sierra Club  and its own consistent \ninterpretation of the Clean Air Act, EPA claims to \u201cnow recognize[]\u201d that \ncarcinogens can be \u201cthreshold pollutants.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (citing EPA, \nGuidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005)). Thus, EPA seeks to bypass \nthe fact that it lacks substantial evidence to show that HCl is not a carcinogen by \n7 \n \n \n \n now claiming it  is irrelevant whether HCl is a carcinogen and the agency does not \nhave to make any such showing.   \n EPA\u2019s claim to have  newly \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold \npollutants  \u2013 based on a n EPA guidance document from 2005  \u2013 is irrelevant under \nthe Clean Air Act.  Because \u201c Congress clearly intended that carcinogens be \nconsidered nonthreshold pollutants,\u201d 63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (emphasis added), \nEPA\u2019s  views on whether carcinogens can be considered threshold pollutants do not \nmatter.  The meaning of the Clean Air Act does not change just because EPA\u2019s \nviews on whether carcinogens are threshold pollutants change. Where Congress \nhas clearly expressed its intent, EPA\u2019s job is to effectuate that intent, not to subvert \nit, regardless of whether EPA\u2019s views have come to differ from the clearly \nexpressed intent of Congress.  \nFurther, if it existed at all, but see supra, EPA\u2019s purported authority to set \nlimits under \u00a7 112(d)(4) that are less stringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -\n(3) comes not from the statutory text but Senator Durenberger\u2019s floor statement.  63 \nFed. Reg. at 18,765.  That is the only authority EPA has ever cited for this reading \nof \u00a7 112(d)(4). And if that floor statement truly expressed Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA can set less stringent limits under \u00a7 112(d)(4), it would equally express \nCongress\u2019s \u201cclear[] inten[ t] that carcinogens be considered nonthreshold  \npollutants.\u201d Id. Thus, if EPA wants to issue a HBEL for HCl it must establish with \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not a carcinogen \u2013  as the D.C. Circuit has already \nmade plain to EPA. Sierra Club , 895 F.3d at 10- 11. \n Remarkably, the supplemental proposal does not even mention EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute. EPA does not acknowledge that its purported \n\u201crecogni[tion]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold pollutants conflicts directly with \nits own repeated findings that Congress clearly intended that carcinogens cannot be \ntreated as threshold pollutants. EPA does not say why it believes itself entitled to \ntreat carcinogens as threshold pollutants, despite its understanding that Congress \n\u201cclearly\u201d did not intend such tre atment of them. Nor does EPA purport to alter its \nstatutory interpretation, let alone provide a reasoned basis for doing so.  For this \nreason as well, EPA\u2019s action is unlawful. See, e.g. , Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 221- 222 (2011).  \n8 \n \n \n \n  Likewise, EPA makes no attempt to reconcile its apparent current position \nthat the lack of research into whether HCl is carcinogenic is irrelevant, 89 Fed. \nReg. at 9,092, with its previous finding that the lack of conclusive research is a \nreason not to is sue a HBEL for HCl, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031. See U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d at 624. Indeed, EPA does not even see fit to acknowledge the \nposition it took in the boilers rule and the U.S. Sugar case, let alone provide a \nrational basis for departing from it.  \n Even if EPA were free to ignore  the text of the statute,  Sierra Club, and the \nagency\u2019s own long-held interpretation of the Clean Air Act and issue a HBEL for \nHCl without showing that HCl is not carcinogenic, setting a HBEL for HCl based \non the supplemental proposal would be unlawful and arbitrary. Once again, just as \nin Sierra  Club , EPA  assumes it can equate absence of evidence with evidence of \nabsence . See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. The only difference here is that EPA \ndeploys that assumption to claim it can treat HCl as a threshold pollutant rather \nthan to claim it can treat HCl as a non-carcinogen. Compare  89 Fed. Reg.  9092  \nwith Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. See also EPA Brick Kilns Brief at 23- 25. \n Having disavowed any obligation to show that HCl is not carcinogenic , EPA \nnext claims \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic .\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9,092.  Even assuming \narguendo  that EPA can simply bypass the need to show that a pollutant is not \ncarcinogenic, EPA does not and cannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test for \nwhether a pollutant has a threshold, either for cancer of any other health harm. \nEPA does not discuss all the other indicators of whether a pollutant has a threshold, \nlet alone why it has chosen not to consider them.  \nFurther, f ar from providing \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl is not \nmutagenic, EPA makes clear that the current evidence regarding whether HCl is mutagenic is outdated and , at best,  equivocal.  All EPA claims is that \u201c[i]n the case \nof HCl, the available evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect.\u201d Id. That is precisely the same lack of evidence sought to rely on in Sierra Club, \nand falls far short of the required demonstration with substantial evidence that HCl is not mutagenic.  See 895 F.3d a t 10-11. \n9 \n \n \n \n Indeed,  apart from a 1992 study on \u201cbacteria,\u201d  the only studies EPA can \nidentif y indicate that HCl is  mutagenic  in mammals . Id. EPA seeks to discount \nthese studies by claiming \u2013 without providing any citation whatsoever \u2013 that some \nunidentified researchers have found in unidentified research that these results were \ncaused by exceptionally high doses of HCl.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.  EPA\u2019s  citation -\nfree and unsubstantiated  critique of the only mammalian evidence  it has \u2013 evidence  \nshowing  that HCl is mutagenic  \u2013 scarcely  amounts to  a demonstration with  \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not  carcinogenic.  See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10-\n11. \nEPA\u2019s attempt to rely on \u201c[ a]nother important consideration,\u201d the \nmechanisms that can cause cancer, is similarly flawed. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. EPA \nstates that increased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia, \ncan lead to cancer. Id.  EPA further states that an animal study has shown that HCl \nexposure cause s hyperplasia in rats. Id.  Then, however \u2013  just as with mutagenicity \n\u2013 EPA seeks to discount its own evidence by arguing that the  same study did not \nshow that HCl caused the rats to ge t cancer. Id . But it is EPA\u2019s argument that \nhyperplasia, as a purported \u201cmechanism\u201d of cancer, is relevant to whether HCl is a pollutant for which a cancer threshold exist.  EPA\u2019s only evidence is that HCl does  \ncause hyperplasia.  Therefore, EPA\u2019s hyperplasia argument  scarcely demonstrates \nwith substantial evidence that HCl is not  a threshold pollutant.  As for EPA\u2019s claim \nthat the study does not demonstrate HCl causes cancer , it is irrelevant. It is EPA \u2019s \nburden to demonstrat e with substantial evidence that HCl does not cause cancer . \nSierra Club.  895 F.3d at 10 -11. EPA does not claim that its 1995 rat study provides \nsuch evidence, nor could it. Id.  \nEPA next claims to have \u201c similarly recognized the existence of a  threshold \nof exposure for hyperplasia  and resulting cancer outcomes from  exposure to \nchloroform.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092- 9093 The agency claims \u201c[c] hloroform was \nlabeled as likely to be carcinogenic to  humans under high -exposure conditions  that \ncause hyperplasia. However, the  EPA concluded that chloroform is not likely to be \ncarcinogenic to humans  under exposure conditions that do not cause hyperplasia. \u201d \nId. That argument merely underscores the e xtent to which EPA is defying what the \nagency itself describes as Congress\u2019s clear intent that carcinogens not be treated as \n10 \n \n \n \n threshold pollutants. Chloroform is, by EPA\u2019s own finding, a probable human \ncarcinogen.  https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA has \nnever claimed chloroform is a threshold pollutant, let alone identified a threshold \nbelow which it does not cause cancer . EPA\u2019s new suggestion that it can treat \nchloroform as a threshold pollutant is a good example of why OMB cautioned EPA \nthat its new approach was \u201cprecedential\u201d and urged  the agency to seek \u201cexternal  \nscientific review before considering finalizing a threshold proposal. \u201d OMB Review \nDraft at 20 (emphasis added).  \nAlthough EPA did not find that chloroform is a threshold pollutant, as the \nagency now inaccurately suggests, it did find the chloroform is a probable \ncarcinogen based on  evidence that it causes hyperplasia. \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA also has \nevidence that HCl causes hyperplasia. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. Thus, EPA\u2019s new \narguments about HCl are not \u201csimilar\u201d to those underlying the chloroform finding, \nid. To the contrary, EPA discounts the finding that HCl caused hyperplasia because \nthe study did not also show that HCl caused cancer . Nowhere does EPA explain \nwhy, if it believes hyperplasia is a mechanism for carcinogenicity sufficient to \ndemonstrate that chloroform causes cancer  even without an independent direct \nfinding that chloroform causes cancer , it does not reach the same conclusion for \nHCl.     \n Further , EPA states only that HCl cause s hyperplasia in rats.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092.  It does not claim to have identified any level below which HCl does not \ncause  hyperplasia in rats , let alone people.  Thus, even if EPA identified a threshold \nbelow which  chloroform  did not cause hyperplasia \u2013 which it has not \u2013  that \nsituation  would not be \u201csimilar[] ,\u201d id.  \nRemarkably, the record shows EPA so eager to substitute its new views for \nwhat the agency itself has described as Congress\u2019s clear intent that it ignored cautionary comments from the Office of Management and Budget. In its review of \nEPA\u2019s proposal under EO 12866, OMB commented \nHas EPA\u2019s approach here for HCl and under 112(d)(4) been peer \nreviewed by the SAB, since EPA\u2019s action here appears to be \n11 \n \n \n \n precedential? Recommend seeking comment on whether EPA should \nseek such external scientific review before considering finalizing a \nthreshold proposal.  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015 -0201 (\u201cOMB Review Draft\u201d) at 20 (emphasis added). \nThen, after EPA apparently refused to alter its approach, seek peer review by SAB, \nor even seek comment on the need for \u201csuch external scientific\u201d review, OMB requested in a second round of comments that EPA at least take comment on \nwhether \u201c any additional scientific evidence of this health- based threshold proposal \nfor hyperplasia is available that would help inform EPA in their risk assessment \nand subsequent decision -making \u2026 and \u201c[w] hether additional external scientific \nreview is needed before finalizing a threshold- based proposal, since EPA\u2019s \nsupplemental proposed action under 112(d)(4) appears, if true, to be precedent. \u201d Id. \nEvidently, OMB\u2019s comments were futile. EPA\u2019s new approach has not been \npeer reviewed by SAB, and EPA made no effort to seek comment on seeking SAB \nreview, despite OMB\u2019s identification of its new approach to the evaluation of \ncancer risk as \u201cprecedential.\u201d Apparently, EPA did not seek \u201cany\u201d additional \nexternal scientific review or evidence. In any event, EPA does not mention OMB\u2019s concerns in its proposal, let alone respond to them or identify any external review \nor evidence that address those concerns.  \nII. EPA \u2019S APPROACH TO CANCER RISK IS ARBITRARY AND \nINCONSISTENT WITH  ITS OWN GUIDELINES.  \nAs outlined in the 2005 Carcinogenic Risk Assessment Guidelines \n(\u201cGuidelines\u201d), it has long been EPA\u2019s policy and practice to presume that \ngenotoxic carcinogens do not have a known threshold of exposure and thus, no \ndose is safe .\n1 A second practice is that of emplo ying linear extrapolation for  \nchemicals that undergo carcinogenic risk assessment and are found to act via a mutagenic mode of action, unless it can be demonstrated unequivocally that a \nchemical acts via a non- mutagenic mode of action.   \n \n1 EPA, Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment ( \u201cGuidelines \u201d) at 1- 11 (2005),  \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2013 -09/documents/cancer_guidelines_final_3- 25-05.pdf .  \n12 \n \n \n \n Indeed, the Guidelines state that \u201c[w] hen the weight of evidence evaluation \nof all available data are insufficient to establish the mode of action for a tumor site \nand when scientifically plausible based on the available data, linear extrapolation is \nused as a default approach (emphasis added) , because linear extrapolation \ngenerally is considered to be a health- protective approach. Nonlinear approaches \ngenerally should not be used in cases where the mode of action has not been ascertained.\u201d\n2 For clarity on what is meant by \u2018nonlinear\u2019, footnote 3 on page  16 \nstates \u201c[t] he term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used here in a narrower sense than its usual \nmeaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer guidelines, the \nterm \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range \nof low doses that include ze ro) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic \nmodel, which shows some response at all doses above zero). \u201d3 The Guidelines \nmake clear that nonlinear or threshold approaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \nEPA  has not met its own standard in its current analysis, in the absence of a \ntoxicological risk assessment that evaluated HCl for its carcinogenic potential.\n4 \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s proposal to set a health- based exposure level based on the \npresumption of an existing threshold is no t in accordance  with other federal \nguidelines, including the FDA Guidance for Industry S2B Genotoxicity: A \nStandard Battery for Genotoxicity Testing of Pharmaceuticals, states, \u201cCompounds which are positive in tests that detect such kinds of damage [damage to DNA] have the potential to be human carcinogens and/or mutagens, i.e., may induce cancer \n \n2 Guidelines at 3- 21. \n3 Guidelines at 1- 11. \n4 See Guidelines at  3-21: \u201cWhen the weight of evidence evaluation of all available data are insufficient to \nestablish the mode of action for a tumor site and when scientifically plausible based on the available data, \nlinear extrapolation is used as a default approach, because linear  extrapolation generally is considered to \nbe a health -protective approach . Nonlinear approaches generally should not be used in cases where the \nmode of action has not been ascertained. \u201d Footnote at 3 section 1- 11states \u201c The term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used \nhere in a narrower sense than its usual meaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer \nguidelines, the term \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range of low \ndoses that include z ero) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic model, which shows some \nresponse at all doses above zero). \u201d Importantly, the Guidelines make clear that nonlinear or threshold \napproaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \n13 \n \n \n \n and/or heritable defects.\u201d5 Further supporting this approach, a 2006 scientific \nreview article by EPA staff person, Michael Cimino, reported that, \u201cThe default \nregulatory assumption is that chemicals that are genotoxic in standard tests can \ncause mutations in humans (in somatic and/or germ cells), and can contribute to \nadverse health outcomes, such as cancer, via a genotoxic or mutagenic mode of \n(toxic) action (MOA).\u201d6  \nNotably, EPA\u2019s staff co -published a  peer reviewed article  describ ing that \ndifferent carcinogens act via multiple mechanisms or MOA\u2019s and it can be \nchallenging to determine which is the main MOA, especially when considering \ndifferences in exposure at different life stages and at differential doses.7 This notion \nis reinforced  by comments submitted by Joseph Landolph, a n exp ert and reviewe r \nof EPA \u2019s draft Framework for Determining a Mutagenic M ode of Action for \nCarcinogenicity  (\u201cFramework \u201d). While the Framework was never finalized, in \nresponse to a charge question referr ing to the clarity and c ompleten ess of the \nFramework, Landolph \u201cstrongly recommend[ ed] adding that if a mutagenic \nchemical carcinogen does not have a conc lusive mutagenic MOA, but no other \nevidence exists to conclusively document a non-mutagenic MOA, then this \nchemical  is treated as acting by a mutagenic MOA for risk  assessment and \nregulatory p urposes.  For risk  assessment purpose s, this chemical is presum ed to \nfollow a linear, no threshold dose -response curve for cancer induction. \u201d8 Landolph \nis supported by subject matter  exper t\u2019s understanding that even when the MOA is \n \n5 FDA, Guidance for Industry S2B Genotoxicity: A Standard Battery for Genotoxicity Testing of \nPharmaceuticals  at page 1 ( July 1997) .

IN THE ABSENCE  OF A  CARCIN OGEN IC RISK E VALUATION , EPA \nHAS NOT PROVIDED S UBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT HCL CAN \nBE TREATED AS A  THRESHOLD  POLLU TANT.   \nEPA \u2019s Information Risk Information System ( \u201cIRIS \u201d) database for \ntoxicol ogical assessments for HCl states that qu antitative estimates of either \ncarcinogenic risk from oral  and/or inhalation exposure were \u201cnot assessed under \nthe IRIS Program \u201d.10 Indeed, while the proposed rule makes reference  to the \n \n9 See Exhibits E and F, TSCA eva luation comments submitted by UCSF P RHE  as well as Ea rthjus tice \ncomments published  on docket EPA -HQ-OPPT- 2023- 0265- 0005, which  reference the N ational Resource \nCouncil \u2019s Science and Decisions: Advanc ing Risk Assessment (2009)  and state: \u201c The absence of a known \nmutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other \nMOAs can operate with no threshold. Further, the  NASEM states that human variability, exposure to \nother chemicals, and background disease  processes alone can result in linear dose- response relationships \nat low doses, regardless of  whether mutagenic MOAs are known:  Background exposures and underlying \ndisease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population \ndoses of concern. The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for  \nmechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose- response relationship  can be linear at a \nlow dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease  process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to \nbackground processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a \nbaseline level of  dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the  \nbackground process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That  may be difficult to  \nmeasure because of background noise in the system but may be  addressed through dose -response \nmodeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic \ncancer mechanism can result in linear dose response  relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, \nnonlinear dose -response  processes\u2014 for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor \nsurveillance,  DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles \u2014may be found to  \ncause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background  processes, given \ncancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures  and high variability in human \nsusceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low -dose linear dose -response relationships in the \nhuman population.\u201d   \n10 EPA, Hy drogen Chloride Cancer Assessment ( n.d). Available at : \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=396 .  \n15 \n \n \n \n assertion  that \u201cEPA no w recognizes that car cinogen s can be either non- threshold or \nthreshold  polluta nts\u201d11, Commenters have shown such a statement to be  out-of-step \nwith its own practi ces and policy . EPA  has not  evaluated HCl for it s carcinogenic \npotential. To further demonstrate its lack of substantial evidence, EPA \u2019s proposal \nreference s a single animal study that  was used to derive a noncancer  reference \nconcentration after finding hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa larynx and trachea  in \nrats.  \nThe a forementioned study was use d to derive a  point of departure for the \nreference concentration for HCl and utilized the  lowest observed adverse effect \nlevel (\u201cLOA EL\u201d), which is less preferential when compared to the more significant \nno observed adverse effect level (\u201cNO AEL\u201d) or even a benchmark dose.12 By \nEPA\u2019s definition, the NOAEL  is \u201can experimentally determined dose at which \nthere was no statistically or biologically significant indication of the toxic effect of \nconcern\u201d and only in instances where a NOAEL \u201chas not been demonstrated \nexperimentally, the term LOAEL is used.\u201d13 While EPA did include an uncertainty \nfactor for having to extrapolate from a LOAEL to NOAEL , the critical study used \nto derive the reference concentration failed to identify a level at which no effect \noccurred  and as such, the single study for which EPA is relying on failed to \nprovide definiti ve evidence that a no  effect level ( or a threshold of exposure ) exists \nfor HCl . This  recognition is signi ficant  given th at EPA  argues HCl should be \ntreated as a threshold polluta nt even in the absence  of adequate carcinogenicity  \nstudies.   \nGenotoxicity studies, which are designed to \u201cdetect compounds that induce \ngenetic damage by various mechanisms\u201d14 are not widely available for HCl. Very \nfew studies have explored either genotoxicity or carcinogenicity, and yet the \n \n11 89 Fed.

In \nreality, from the few identified studies evaluating genotoxicity, at least two identified concentrations at which HCl was found to induce a response: in a 1981 \nstudy , the Escherichia coli DNA -repair assay  was positive at a concentration of 25 \nug/well a s well as a s eparate s tudy finding chromosomal nondisjunction induced at \na concentration of 100 ppm in Drosophila melanogaster in 2008.\n15 Chromosomal \nnondisjunction is a phenomena where the chromosomes fail to separate, producing daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. This is also considered a \nmolecular initiating event, which is defined as \u201cthe initial interaction between a molecule and a biomolecule or biosystem that can be causally linked to an outcome \nvia a pathway\u201d.\n16 Molecular initiating events are a sequence of events that go along \nwith the adverse outcome pathway framework and serve as the basis for \ndetermining genotoxicity and in turn, the potential for mutagenicity. The \nassessment of HCl\u2019s ability to induce a positive response in at least two separate \nstudies provides evidence that exposure to HCl is mechanistically linked to potential genotoxic and potentially mutagenic outcomes (which cannot be rule d \nout).  \nFinally, Commenters draw attention to a fa tal flaw associated with EPA\u2019s \nnoncancer risk value for HCl. A ccording to CalEPA\u2019s Office of E nvironmenta l \nHealth Hazard Assessment (\u201cOEHHA \u201d), EPA itself rated its HCl database as \u201clow -\nconfidence \u201d given \u201c(1) the use of only one dose; (2) limited toxicity evaluation; (3) \nthe lack of reproductive toxicity data; and (4) the lack of chronic exposure \n \n15 National Research Council (US) , Committee on Emergency and Continuous Exposure Guidance Levels \nfor Selected Submarine Contaminants.

EPA\u2019S PROPOSED RISK APPROACH TO ASSESS A H EALTH-BASED \nEMISSION LIMITATION  FOR HYDROCHLORIC ACID FOR THE LIME \nMANUFACTURING SOURCE CATEGORY ( 2023) MEMORANDUM IS \nFLAWED  AND UNDE RESTIMATES THE NONCANCER RISK  \nASSOCIATED WITH HCL E XPOSURE . \nEPA has requested comment on w hether its proposed  risk analysis  and \nsubsequent  extrapolation of an  emission limit of 300 tons per year ( \u201ctpy\u201d) would \nprovide an a mple margin of safe ty. In reviewing the Memorandum  entitled , Risk \nApproach to Assess a H ealth -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for \nthe Lime Manufacturing Source Category  (\u201c2023 Memo \u201d), Comme nters have \nidentified several  flaws , including EPA \u2019s unjustified use of a weaker noncancer \nrisk value , its continued underestimation  of noncancer risk s, and its \nunsubstantiated  proposed risk approach.   \nBy failing to use the California OEHHA Reference Exposure Level (REL) to \nevaluate  acute and chronic risk of HCl exposure  EPA underestimates  risks.  \nTo ensure it follows the best available science, EPA should use the latest \nOEHHA risk exposure level ( \u201cREL \u201d) for HCl. EPA has not provide d adequate \nrationale for choosing to ignore OEHHA \u2019s REL , which is an order of magnitude \nstronger than EPA\u2019s RfC.18 \nRefusing to follow the OEHHA noncancer risk value conflicts with the Act\u2019s \ndirection to employ the best available science, and with EPA\u2019s own scientific risk \nassessment guidelines. As EPA admits, EPA has long recognized that OEHHA \u2019s \n\u201cprocess for developing [dose -response assessments] is similar to that used by EPA \n \n17 OEHHA, Appendix D.3 Chronic RELs and toxicity summaries using the previous version of the Hot \nSpots Risk Assessment guidelines (OEHHA 1999)  at 309-312.

Instead , it uses values that are orders of magnitude less \nprotective and underestimates the acute risk by a factor of 100 (see 2023 Memo ). \nEPA\u2019s proposal thus relies on a significant underestimate of the acute health \nhazards of the regulated facilities\u2019 emissions. It is both unlawful and arbitrary, as it \nis misalig ned with EPA\u2019s longstanding practice, an unsupported change with that \npractice, and a failure to apply the best available science.  \nIn addition to underestimating acute non-cancer health hazards, EPA is \nwillingly and knowingly exposing communities of color and low-income \ncommunities to increased and unnecessary harm from short-term HCl exposure. \nThe ERPG -1 is a guideline level calculated by the U.S. Department of Energy that \nrecognizes exposure to a chemical, like HCl, at this limit will lead to certain health \neffects.22 Conversely, the REL developed by OEHHA represents the reference \n \n19 EPA, Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the 2019 \nRisk and Technology Review Proposed Rule  (May 2019) at 27.

As the SAB has \nexplained:  \nThe incorporation of the available California Reference Exposure Levels \n(RELs) for the assessment of acute effects is a conservative and acceptable \napproach to characterize acute risks . The Panel  has some concern with the use \nof the Acute Exposure Guidelines Limits (AEGLs) and Emergency Response \nPlanning  Guidelines (ERPGs ) AEGL -2 and ERPG-2 values should never be \nused in residual risk assessments because they represent levels that if \nexceeded could cause serious or irreversible health effects.24 \n \n23 84 Fed.

Available at: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-\n02/documents/epa -sab-10-007-unsigned.pdf .  \n \n \n20 \n \n \n \n The AEGL and ERPG numbers would be expected to underestimate risk. \nUsing these numbers is likely to discount or cloak the level of risk to the maximum \nexposed individual.  \nAs stated, EPA  has long recognized CalEPA RELs as authoritative and \nregularly uses them in risk assessments. It gives no reasoned scientific explanation for refusing to use this value as the best available reference dose here. It must use \nthe most up-to -date and best available scientific information on the risks and health \neffects of the HCl REL in its risk assessment. Doing so will lead to a recognition of \nincreased acute risk from lime kiln facilities\u2019 emissions \u2013 especially if EPA is \nproposing to allow a staggeringly high 300 tp y of HCl emissions based on its \napproach outlined in the 2023 Memo . \nFor c hronic non cancer risk  and where  child -specific reference values are \nunavailable, EPA must consult science on early exposure impacts and use an \nadditional default or uncertainty  factor.  \nThe increased susceptibility of children, while known to exist, has not been \nquantified for many toxic chemicals. Until EPA has child- specific or child- based \nreference values available for a given pollutant, EPA should apply a default or \nuncertainty factor  of at least 10 to account for increased risk from early- life \nexposures for non-cancer risk in this rulemaking and other risk assessments.  \nThis would be consistent with the NAS recommendation on the need for \nEPA to use default factors to account for greater risk,  with the science developed \nand considered by OEHHA, and with the 10X factor enacted by Congress in the \nFood Quality Protection Act.\n25 Specifically, as the SAB report explained:  \nCalifornia EPA/OEHHA has determined that inhalation dosimetry for \nchildren is sufficiently different from adults to warrant a full 10- fold intra -\nindividual pharmacokinetic uncertainty factor (i.e., an extra 3-fold PK uncertainty \nfor children relative to th e IRIS method) as a default approach. In setting non-\ncancer reference exposure levels (RELs), Cal EPA/OEHHA also considers that \n \n25 NAS, Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment (2009) at 190-93, 203.

EP A , 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) ( LEAN ). \nEPA earlier explained that it ha d finalized six actions in resp onse to that order.  Those \nactions include hazardous air pollution rules requi red under sections 112(d) and 112(f) of the \nClean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d), (f).

In a case concerning the national emission standards for pulp mill sources, the \ncourt held that EPA must set limits on uncontro lled hazardous air pollutant (\u201cHAP\u201d) emissions  \nwhen it conducts rulemakings under section 112(d )(6) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6).  EPA \nthen reported that it was evaluating whether LEAN  affects the scope of its obligations under this \nCourt\u2019s order.  See, e.g., ECF No. 55.  \nSince then, EPA has concluded that LEAN  does not affect the scope of its obligations for \nthe risk and technology review of th e Iron and Steel Foundries category.2  But for the other five \nof the source categories\u2014Lime Manufacturing Plants, Miscellaneous Coating Manufacturing, \nRubber Tire Manufacturing, Plywood and Compos ite Wood Products, and Taconite Iron Ore \nProcessing3\u2014EPA has concluded that, in finalizing its  actions, it did not (or for the source \ncategory italicized in the list below, may not have) set all necessary emission limits for HAP \nemissions as part of its final rules as required by LEAN .  To allow EPA to fill these regulatory \ngaps in accordance with LEAN  and without the need for further litigation on new deadlines, the \nparties ask the Court to extend the deadlines to take final action on these five source categories \nas follows: \n2 85 Fed.

EPA promulgated th ese regulation s through the final agency actio n titled  \n\u201cNESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing; and NESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufacturing\u201d  (\u201cBrick/Clay Rule\u201d),  80 Fed. Reg. 65,470 (Oct. 26, \n2015) .  Petitioner Brick Industry Association (\u201cBIA\u201d) also challenges EPA\u2019s final \naction o n reconsideration of the Brick/ Clay Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 31,234 (May 18, 2016) .   \nThe issues raised by Environmental Petitioners are: 1. Is EPA\u2019s decision to establish health -based standards for acid gas \nemissions consistent with the CAA and reasonable ? \n2. Did EPA reasonably use the Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) \nmethodology to calculate emission standards for sources for which EPA had limited \nemissions data?  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 16 of 135\n-2- \n 3. Is EPA\u2019s creation of alternative emission standards for brick kilns \nconsistent with the CAA and re asonable, where the alternative standards are each \nexpressed in a different unit of measurement and calculated based on the best-\nperforming sources according to that unit of measurement? \nThe issues raised by Industry Petitioners are: \n4. Is BIA barred from challenging EPA\u2019s inclusion  of synthetic area source \ndata in MACT floor calculations?  And if reviewable, d id EPA reasonably include \nemissions information from synthetic area sources in calculating the MACT floors to \nset standards for ma jor sources?  \n5. Did EPA adequately justify the MACT floors for particulate matter \n(\u201cPM\u201d) and non-mercury metals for brick industry sources and reasonably estimate \nthe emissions from the best-performing  12 percent of sources?  \n6. Did EPA comply with the CAA in setting mercury standards for sources \nin the brick industry , and in declining to subcategorize based on the mercury content \nof raw materials?  \n7. Does Petitioner TCNA lack standing to challenge the tile industry \nstandards and EPA\u2019s decision to list a maj or source category which includes the tile \nindustry , where TCNA has not shown that any of its members would be injured by \nthe standards for that category ? USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 17 of 135\n-3- \n 8. Does EPA have authority to set standards for major sources in the tile \nindustry when , at the time the standards are proposed and issued , there are no sources \nin the category that would be subject to the standards?  \n9. Is TCNA  barred from challenging EPA\u2019s decision to list a major source \ncategory including ceramic  tile sources?  And if reviewable, did EPA adequately \nsupport the listing of a major source category that includes tile sources?  \n10. Did EPA reasonably rely on reported emission  levels that were measured \nusing an established test method  to set standards for dioxin/furan for tile industry \nsources? \n11. Did EPA reasonably decline to include malfunction data in setting \nstandards for the tile industry? \n12.

Statutory Backgrou nd \nThe Brick/Clay Rule regulates the emissions of hazardous air pollutants \n(\u201cHAPs \u201d) pursuant to CAA section  112, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412.  As amended in 1990, \nsection 7412 directs EPA to regulate HAP emissions utilizing technology -based \nstandards.  Sierra Club v.  EPA , 353 F.3d 976, 979 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  In the 1990 \namendments, Congress designated 189 HAPs that it deemed to be hazardous and \ntherefore subject to regulation .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1) .  Congress also required  \nEPA to identify the categories of sourc es of each HAP , id. \u00a7 7412(c),  and to set \nemission limits for each major stationary source , id. \u00a7 7412(d)(1) .  The statute defines \nmajor sources as those that emit or have the potential to emit considering controls \nmore than ten tons per year of any covere d HAP, or more than twenty -five tons per \nyear of any combination of HAPs.  Id.  \u00a7 7412(a)(1).   Sources that emit lower levels of \nHAPs are classified as \u201carea sources.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(2).    \nFor major sources, section 7412 requires EPA to establish national e mission \nstandards for listed  categories for both new and existing major sources .  These \nstandards are ordinarily  promulgated under section 7412(d) and \u201crequire the \nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to \nthis sec tion (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable)\u201d that the \nAdministrator determines is achievable based on existing technology, taking into consideration cost and other specific factors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  These emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 19 of 135\n-5- \n standards are referred to as \u201cmaximum achievable control technology\u201d or \u201cMACT\u201d \nstandards.  \nTo establish MACT standards, EPA follows a two -step process.   U.S. Sugar \nCorp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  First, EPA establishes a \u201cMACT \nfloor,\u201d which is the absolute minimum level of emissions reductions covered sources \nmust achieve.  Mossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1235 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  The MACT floor is based on what level of emissions limitation has been \nachieved within the source category .  For new sources, the MACT floor is \u201cthe \nemission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  The MACT floor for \nexisting sources in categories or subcategories with 30 or more sources is \u201cthe average \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing  12 percent of the existing sources \n(for which the Administrator has emission s information).\u201d  Id.  Where there are fewer \nthan 30 sources in a category of subcategory, the MACT floor is determined based on \nthe best-performing 5 sources.  Id.  Second, EPA has the discretion to set standards \nthat are more stringent  than the MACT floor (known as beyond -the-floor  standards) \nthat EPA determines are achievable \u201cta king into consideration the cost of achieving \nsuch emissions reduction, and any non -air quality health and environmental impacts \nand energy requirements.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(2) ; see U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594-95.  \nEPA has extensive discretion to determine whether and  how to collect data and \nto decide how to identify and assess relevant data when  establishing emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 20 of 135\n-6- \n standards.

First, EPA \nhas discretion to promulgate \u201chealth -based\u201d emission limits  pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4) .  When section 7412 was first enacted, it required EPA to identify and \nregulate HAPs when they were found to \u201ccause, or contribute to, an increase in \nmortality or an increase in serious irreversible [ ] or incapacitating reversible [ ] \nillness.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 91 -604, \u00a7 4(a), 84 Stat. 1676, 1685 (1970), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) \n(1970).

Pursuant to a consent decree establishing deadlines \nfor the proposal and promulgation of standards, EPA issued a proposed rule on December 18, 2014, 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, and promulgated the final Brick/Clay Rule \non October 26, 2015 .  80 Fed. Reg. 65,470.  \nFollowing publication of the Brick/Clay Rule, the Industry Petitioners each \nsubmitted petitions for administrative reconsideration.  On May 1 2, 2016, EPA \ndenied BIA and TCNA\u2019s  petitions , and granted in part and denied in part Kohler\u2019s \npetition.  81 Fed. Reg. 31,234  (May 18, 2016) . \nThe Brick/Clay Rule establishes emission limitations for two  major source \ncategories: brick and structural clay products manufacturing (the \u201cBrick Rule\u201d), and \nclay ceramics manufacturing (the \u201cClay Rule\u201d).  The brick and structural clay products \nsource category include s manufacturers of brick, clay pipe, roof tile, extru ded floor \nand wall tile, and other extruded, dimensional clay products.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,473/3.  The clay ceramics source category includes manufacturers of pressed tile and sanitaryware (e.g., toilets and sinks).  Id.  at 65,477/3.  The HAP s emitted by these  \nsources are primarily acid gases such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and \nchlorine .  Id. at 65,473/2.  These sources also emit lesser amounts o f metals, including \nmercury , as well as  dioxin/furan.  Id .  Depending on duration and level of the  \nexposure, exposure to these chemicals can cause a variety of chronic and acute effects to the lungs, skin, central nervous system, digestive system, and kidneys.

I n \ngeneral, EPA  set three types of standards:  (1) numeric emission limitations at the \nMACT floor level; (2) health -based numeric emission limitations, pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4); and (3) non -numeric work practice standards.  The specific requirements \nchallenged in this case are discussed below in the sections of the argument that relate \nto each requirement.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nThis case presents challenges to the Brick/Clay Rule from two sides.  On the \none hand, Environmental Petitioners argue that the rule is not sufficiently protective \nof public health .  They challenge  health -based standards  set pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4), emission  limits calculated using an established statistical methodology, and \nthe flexibility afforded to industry to choose  standards that are  all calculated based on \nthe best-performing sources.  On the other hand, Industry Petitioners argue that the \nrule is overly stringent  for a litany of reasons largely relating to the data EPA \nconsidered in setting the standards for brick and  clay ceramics manufacturing \nfacilities.  Neither side is right.  \nA. Environmental Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n1. EPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for acid gases \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  The statute does not specify what it means when a \nhealth threshold \u201chas been established,\u201d and the concept of an \u201cestablished\u201d threshold is unique to section 7412(d)(4).  The identification of an \u201cestablished\u201d USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 24 of 135\n-10- \n health threshold in the same rulemaking in which EPA set health -based emission \nlimits is fully consistent with the plain language of the CAA.  EPA was not required to \naffirmatively conclude that the acid gases were not carcinogens before invoking section 7412(d)(4).  Petitioners\u2019 argument to the contrary misunderstands the nature of scientific uncertainty and how EPA must address such uncertainty when regulating.  \nAdditionally, EPA thoroughly analyzed the best available scientific information, \nincluding well -established, peer -reviewed toxicity databases, to determine that the  \nthree pollutants all had health thresholds.  Furthermore, EPA appropriately \nconsidered evidence and classification of carcinogenic risk in considering whether \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  had health thresholds .  EPA \nprovided adequate support for the specific health threshold levels it identified , and  \nEPA\u2019s technical judgments are entitled to the highest level of deference .  Finally, \nEPA\u2019s health -based standards include an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d as required by \nsection 7412(d)(4) because EPA  built a margin of safety into its process for translating \nthe acid gas health thresholds into emission limits by including several conservative assumptions in its emissions modeling.   This approach is consistent with the statute, \nand EPA fully explained why it expected this approach to result in exposure \nconcentrations well below the identified threshold values. \n2. EPA\u2019s use of the Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) methodology to \naccount for variability in calculating MACT floors for which the Agency had limited emissions data was reasonable.  This Court has affirmed EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 25 of 135\n-11- \n general matter, and EPA has sufficiently articulated a process for ensuring that the \napplication of the methodology to limited datasets still results in a reasonable estimate of the emissio ns achieved in practice by the best-performing sources in each \nsubcategory.  Moreover, EPA followed that process here, which resulted in adjustments to five of the MACT floors for brick kilns to more accurately account for \nthe distribution of data .  EPA ad equately explained the basis for all five of those \nadjustments.  Additionally, the upward adjustment of two of those floors was related to the addition of a raw material variability factor, which Petitioners do not challenge and which was not part of the U PL limited dataset analysis.  Furthermore  EPA may \nmake either upward or downward adjustments to its MACT floor calculations if it \ndetermines based on its limited dataset analysis that such adjustments are necessary. \n3. EPA\u2019s promulgation of alternative emi ssion limits for mercury and non -\nmercury metals for brick tunnel kilns was both consistent with the statute and \nreasonable.  Nothing in the plain language of section 7412(d) forbids EPA from promulgating multiple alternative MACT standards, so long as thos e standards require \nthe maximum degree of emission reduction and are based on the best-performing source or sources.  Because each floor was determined based on the best-performing \nsources according to the unit of measurement in which the floor is expresse d, the \nalternative floors are all based on the best-performing sources and satisfy the \nrequirements of section 7412(d)(3).  EPA\u2019s method for calculating the alternative \nlimits was therefore reasonable.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 26 of 135\n-12- \n B. Industry Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n4. BIA\u2019s challenge to EPA\u2019s inclusion  of synthetic area source  data is \nbarred because BIA did not challenge the approach when EPA first used it in the \n2003 Rule.  In any case, EPA properly included emissions data from synthetic area \nsources, which would emit HAPs at major source levels but for their federally -\nenforceable controls, in determining the MACT floors for PM and mercury emission s \nfrom brick kilns.  EPA\u2019s use of such data is consistent with the statutory requirement \nto determine MACT floors based on e mission levels achieved by the \u201cbest \nperforming\u201d sources.  Inclusion of synthetic area sources in the MACT floor \ncalculations is consistent with the CAA, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA \npolicy.  \n5. EPA\u2019s determination to base the PM and non -mercu ry HAP metal \nstandards for brick industry sources on the top 12 percent of sources for which it had emissions data was consistent with the statute and reasonable.  EPA\u2019s other proposed approach, preferred by BIA, would have set standards based on the top 1 2 percent of \nthe total number of sources in the category.  If EPA had used that approach, it would \nhave needed to ensure that it had emissions data from all the best -performing sources \nin the category .  In the final rule, EPA  appropriately rejected BIA\u2019s p referred \napproach because EPA had no basis to conclude that it had data from all of the \nsources comprising the best-performing 12 percent of the entire industry . USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 27 of 135\n-13- \n 6. EPA appropriately set mercury standards for brick kilns at the MACT \nfloor levels based on w hat the best-performing sources actually achieved.  EPA did \nnot and could not consider other factors when calculating the MACT floor.  The \nstandards are not based on any specific control method, and leave sources with flexibility as to the methods for achi eving compliance.  Further, in setting the mercury \nstandards for sources in the brick industry, EPA reasonably declined to subcategorize \nbased on raw material content, and legislative history regarding EPA\u2019s ability to consider raw material switching is no t applicable here.   \n7. TCNA has not adequately demonstrated that it has standing to challenge \nthe standards and the major source category listing of tile industry sources.  In arguing that EPA impermissibly promulgated standards for a source category that includes no \nmajor sources, TCNA fails to allege that any of its members have suffered a cognizable injury.   \n8. EPA has authority to set standards for tile industry sources, and its \npromulgation of such standards was proper even in the absence of sources that would \nbe subject to the standards at the time of proposal or promulgation.  The tile industry sources are part of a source category listed pursuant to section 7412(c), and EPA is required to set standards for listed source categories.  EPA reasonably set major source standards for the tile industry because major sources existed in the industry when the category was listed, and because existing synthetic area sources and area sources could increase emissions to become subject to the major source standar ds. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 28 of 135\n-14- \n 9. The CAA provides for judicial review of EPA\u2019s listing of a major source \ncategory at the time standards are issued for the category.  Because EPA issued major \nsource standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2003, challenges to the li sting should have been brought at that time.  N o challenges to the listing were \nbrought within 60 days of the date the standard was issued, so TCNA\u2019s challenge to \nthe listing is now untimely, and the vacatur of the prior standards does not provide \nanother opportunity to challenge the listing.  In any case, EPA\u2019s listing of the category \nthat includes the tile industry was consistent with the CAA and adequately supported.  \n10. EPA\u2019s reliance on information from tile industry sources collected using \nan establi shed EPA test method, Method 23, to calculate MACT floors for \ndioxin/furan is consistent with the CAA\u2019s requirement that EPA calculate MACT floors based on the best -performing sources for which it has emissions information.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that Method 23 does not provide reliable \u201cemissions information\u201d \nis without merit.  Whether results from Method 23 are appropriate to use in setting \ndioxin/furan emission standards is a decision squarely within the A gency\u2019s expertise, \nand EPA reasonably concluded that Me thod 23 results are reliable and appropriately \nconsidered here.  \n11. EPA reasonably did not include data from periods of malfunction when \nestablishing standards for the tile industry.  To estimate emission levels of the best-performing sources, EPA relied on test data collected from those sources and accounted for variability in their actual operations.  Because malfunctions are USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 29 of 135\n-15- \n unpredictable events with unpredictable effects on emissions, EPA reasonably \ndetermined that information gathered during malfuncti ons was not useful in \ndetermining the MACT floors or otherwise setting standards.   \n12. EPA reasonably set standards for tile industry  mercury and dioxin/furan \nemissions based on the MACT floor.  TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA impermissibly \nconsidered the effect iveness of activated carbon injection controls in setting these \nstandards is misplaced.  EPA did not set them based on anything other than what tile \nsources have actually achieved.  \n13. EPA permissibly calculated the MACT floors for sanitaryware sources \nbased in part on data collected from a source using controls built to comply with the \nvacated 2003 Rule.  Kohler\u2019s argument that use of this data in setting standards was impermissible is without merit.  Vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not erase the actual \nemission reductions that sources had achieved.  Because the CAA requires that EPA \nbase the MACT floors on emission levels that have been achieved, and emissions data using controls demonstrated the emission levels achieved, EPA reasonably considered this data.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nChallenged portions of the Brick/Clay Rule  may not be set aside unless they \nare \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nthe law.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(9).

Id . at 843 & n.11.  \nARGUMENT  \nI. EPA reasonably set health- based emission limits for a cid gases pursuant \nto section 7412(d)(4).  \nIn order for EPA to invoke section 7412(d)(4) and adopt a standard more \nlenient than the MACT floor for a pollutant, two requirements must be met:  (1) there \nmust be an established health thresh old; and (2) the health -based standards must \nprovide an ample margin of safety.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4).  In the Brick/Clay  Rule, \nEPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for three acid gases \n(hydrogen fluoride , hydrogen chloride , and chlorine ) for all existing and new brick \ntunnel k ilns and clay ceramics roller and tunnel kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,471, 65, 474, \n65,478.   \nFirst, before deciding to set health -based standards, EPA appropriately \ndetermined, based on the best available toxicity information, that each of the three pollutants ha s a health threshold.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  For all three pollutants, \nEPA :  (1) evaluated the carcinogenic and non-cancer health effects based on  existing \nscientific literature; (2) identified a health benchmark below which adverse ef fects are \nnot expected to occur; and (3) provided a rationale for their designation as threshold \npollutants.

EPA then assessed \nthe suitability of setting  a health -based standard specifically for brick and  clay USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 32 of 135\n-18- \n ceramics facilities , considering whether setting technology -based standards would \nresult in significant reductions in emissions of other pollutants, the potential for \nenvironmental impacts, the potential for cumulative adverse health effects in light of \nother co -located or nearby sources that also emit pollutants, and the availability of \nindustry -specific data to determine a standard .  80 Fed.

Finally, in determining the appropriate  \nlevel of the health -based standards, EPA developed risk assessments and used \nmodeling to ensure that the established emission limit s would provide an ample \nmargin of safety, and that persons exposed to emissions of the pollutants would not experience the adverse health effects on which the health thresholds are based.  80 \nFed.

Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the requirement that a health threshold \u201chas \nbeen established\u201d  misreads section 7412(d)(4) and misunderstands  how EPA \naddress es scientific uncertainty in the consideration of the potential health effects of a \npollutant.  It also disregards the fact that EPA set such standards after thoroughly \nanalyzing the best available s cientific information in a highly technical field , basing its \ndeterminations on rigorously vetted toxicity assessments of acid gases and adequately \nsupporting both its conclusion that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen \nfluoride had established health thresholds, and the specific threshold values it \nidentified for each pollutant.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 argument fails to account for the \nmethod EPA used to translate its identified health threshold values into emission \nlimitations that provide an ample m argin of safety.  \nA. EPA reasonably construed section 7412(d)(4) . \nSection 7412(d)(4) provides that EPA may establish health -based emission \nstandards \u201c[w]ith respect to pollutants for which a health threshold has been \nestablished.\u201d  The concept of a \u201chealth threshold [that] has been established\u201d is \nunique to section 7412(d)(4).  EPA does not make findings under the CAA regarding USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 34 of 135\n-20- \n the existence of a \u201chealth threshold\u201d outside the context of determining whether to \nset health -based emissi on limit s under this subsection.  Nor does the statute explain  \nwhat constitutes an \u201cestablished\u201d health threshold, or what EPA must do to determine that a health threshold \u201chas been established.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  \nAdditionally, by using the passi ve voice, the statute does not specify who  must \nestablish the health threshold.  Id.   Acco rdingly, the precise meaning of the phrase \n\u201chas been established\u201d is ambiguous.  \nHere, EPA reasonably interprets the phrase \u201chas been established\u201d as \nauthorizing EPA to identify a health threshold for a particular pollutant as part of a rulemaking establishing emission standards.  As the Agency explained , \u201c[i]n the \nabsence of such specificity in the statute, the EPA reads [section 7412(d)(4)] to authorize the EPA to se t health -based limits where, in the EPA\u2019s expert judgment, \nthere is a health threshold for the pollutant below which no adverse health effects are \nexpected to occur.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  Applying this interpretation, EPA \nappropriately determined in the Brick/Clay  Rule that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  all had established health thresholds.  As further explained infra  in \nSection I.B, the analysis suppo rting the r ule includes an evaluation of the available and \nrelevant scientific evidence on the cancer risk and non -cancer health effects of each \npollutant.  See id. at 65,488-89; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41 .  That evidence included \nhuman health  values derived as part of several agenci es\u2019 toxicity assessments, and \nwhich EPA used in identifying  health threshold values for each pollutant.   See 79 Fed. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 35 of 135\n-21- \n Reg. at 75,639/3-40 .  EPA\u2019s approach of concluding in the Brick/Clay Rule that \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  were thre shold pollutants based \non existing toxicity assessments was reasonable.  Nothing in section 7412(d)(4) \nprecludes EPA from determining that a health threshold has been established for pollutants as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -\nbased emission standard.  See Chevron , 467 U.S. at 842- 43 (holding that where a statute \nis \u201csilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u201d the court must defer to the Agency\u2019s interpretation so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d). \nThe plain meaning of section 7412(d)(4) does not support Petitioners\u2019 position \nthat a health threshold must already have been established prior to the rulemaking that promulgates health -based standards .  Petitioners\u2019 references t o case  law \ninterpreting statutes using the present perfect tense are inapposite.  Environmenta l Br. \n34-35.  Neither a statute criminalizing a convicted felon\u2019s receipt of a firearm which \n\u201chas been shipped or transported in interstate . . . commerce,\u201d nor a  statute requiring \na person seeking damages for wrongful imprisonment to show that a conviction \u201chas been reversed or set aside,\u201d contemplates an agency taking further regulatory action.  Indeed, there would be no logical framework for the identified actio ns under the \nstatutes at issue in those other cases to be performed if they had not already taken place, and therefore it would be illogical to read either of those statutes as being predicated on an action that had not yet happened.  Here, however, the statutory USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 36 of 135\n-22- \n framework contemplates EPA exercising its discretion to take further action to set \nhealth -based standards after it determines that tho se pollutants have health \nthresholds.   \nFurthermore , the fact that an unenacted  version of section 7412(d)(4) would \nhave allowed EPA to set health -based standards where a health threshold \u201c can be  \nestablished,\u201d Environmental  Br. 35-36, does not demonstrate that EPA must make a \nthreshold determination prior to the rulemaking in which i t sets health -based \nstandards.  The change from \u201c can be  established\u201d to \u201chas been  established\u201d  is most \nreasonably  read to clarify that it is not sufficient for the establishment of a health \nthreshold to be hypothetically possible.  Instead, section 7412(d) (4) provides that a \nhealth threshold must actually be established for EPA to set health -based standards.   \nHere, EPA \u2019s threshold determination  did just that.  \nFinally, EPA reasonably interpreted section 7412(d) as not requiring consensus \non or the resolution of all uncertainty regarding a pollutant\u2019s health effects before \ndetermining  that a health threshold \u201chas been established\u201d for that pollutant.  As EPA \nexplained w ith respect to the identification of a health threshold value, \u201cthe phrase \n\u2018has been establi shed\u2019 [does not mean] that there is universal agreement on the health \nthreshold level.\u201d  80 Fed.

And nothing in the legislative \nhistory cited by Petitioners suggests otherwise .  The 1990 Senate report , see id. at 27, \nsimply indicates that health -based limits could be appropri ate \u201cwhere health \nthresholds are well -established . . . and the pollutant presents no risk of other adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, for which no threshold can be established.\u201d  S. Rep. \nNo. 101- 228 at 171, 1990 Legis. Hist. at 8511.

But  the Senate repo rt does not state that a \npollutant\u2019s health effects must no longer be subject to \u201cstudy and debate.\u201d   The \nreference to \u201cstudy and debate\u201d appears in the context of explaining that EPA\u2019s authority to set health -based standards is discretionary, as requiring  the Agency to \n\u201cconsider the evidence for a health threshold higher than MACT\u201d in every case would \u201cjeopardize the standard -setting schedule imposed under this section with the kind of \nlengthy study and debate that has crippled the current program .\u201d  Id.

In short, EPA reasonably interprets section 74 12(d)(4) as authorizing it \nto determine that a health threshold has been established as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -based emission  standard, and to \nidentify a health threshold where not all scientific uncertainty has been resolved w ith \nrespect to carcinogenicity.

EPA reasonably found that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  were threshold pollutants  based on existing \nscientific evidence.  \nHere, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 argument, EPA applied its interpretation of \nsection 7412(d)(4) and reasonably found that a health threshold had \u201cbeen \nestablished\u201d for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride .  This finding, as USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 40 of 135\n-26- \n well as EPA\u2019s identi fication of a specific threshold value for each pollutant, is based \non a robust review of existing scientific literature, including consideration of toxicity \ndatabases that identify an exposure level below which adverse health effects are not expected to o ccur.  As part of its review of the health effects of hydrogen chloride , \nchlorine , and hydrogen fluoride , EPA stated that it considered each to be a threshold \npollutant based on a lack of affirmative carcinogenicity data and on the Agency\u2019s knowledge of ho w each pollutant reacts in the body and its likely mechanism of \naction.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41.    \n1. EPA appropriately considered information regarding \ncarcinogenic risk.  \nConsistent with its position that it may not promulgate he alth-based emission \nstandards for carcinogenic pollutants, EPA began its health threshold assessment by \nevaluating the evidence of  carcinogenicity of hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride .  In doing so , EPA considered reviews conducted by seve ral \nexisting authoritative bodies.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  None of those bodies had \nclassified hydrogen chloride , chlorine, or hydrogen fluoride  as carcinogens or \n\u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic,\u201d either individually or in combination.  \nId.  EPA found that there was an  absence of evidence of carcinogenic risk, and \ntherefore went on to consider whether a threshold  existed for each pollutant  below \nwhich other adverse health effects are not expected .  Id.

Reg. at 65,488/2.   \nOne occupational study found no evidence of association between exposure to \nhydrogen chloride  and lung cancer among ch emical manufacturing plant employees.  \nId. at 65,488/3.   EPA found that other occupational studies were not appropriate for \nevaluating the carcinogenic potential of hydrogen chloride  because they involved \nexposure to a mixture of acid gases and other chemi cals, and failed to separate \npotential exposure to hydrogen chloride  from exposure to other substances shown to \nhave carcinogenic activity.

It therefore \nwas reasonable for EPA to conclude , in light of other available evidence  discussed \nbelow,  that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  were threshold \npollutants.

Moreover, Petitioners have pointed to no evidence of ongoing \ndebate in the scientific community regarding the carcinogenicity of  hydrogen chloride , \nchlorine , or hydrogen fluoride.  \nFinally, Petitioners\u2019 concern that EPA\u2019s invocation of section 7412(d)(4) opens \nthe door for the Agency to issue health -based standards  for any HAP s with unknown  \ncancer risks or deliberately \u201c[stay] ignorant\u201d of the cancer risks of a pollutant , \nEnvironmental Br. 28, 30, is unfounded.

EPA also evaluates a host of other \nfactors, including non -cancer health effects, in determining whether a health threshold \nexists, and in further determining whether health -based emission limits are \nappropriate.

And because \nEPA\u2019s exercise of its section 7412( d)(4) authority is discretionary, EPA may decline to \npromulgate health -based standards even if it finds that a pollutant has an established \nhealth threshold.  \n2. EPA reasonably identified health thresholds for acid gases \nthat were equivalent to established human health values.  \nAfter discussing the available evidence on carcinogen icity, EPA then addressed  \nthe non-cancer health effects of chronic and acute exposure to  hydrogen chloride, \nchlorine, and hydrogen fluoride .  For each pollutant, EPA identified a human health \nvalue that is rooted in well -established, peer -reviewed toxicity databases.  S everal \nagencies \u2014including EPA\u2019s Integrated Risk Information System Program, the Agency \nof Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (A TSDR), and the California \nEnvironme ntal Protection Agency \u2014had conducted toxicity assessments of  one or \nmore of  the three pollutants.  80 Fed.

In other \nwords, for each pollutant, EPA based its conclusions on the highest-priority database for which an assessment was available.

After identifying t he facility in each source category \nwith the highest modeled ambient chronic concentration\u2014i.e., the source whose \nemissions would generate exposure at the highest concentrations\u2014EPA then scaled up the emissions of that facility until the emission level would correspond to a non -\ncancer hazard quotient\n14 of one.

Because an emission level of 250 tons per y ear of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent per brick facility  would result in exposures at or below the threshold level \nat the facility  with the greatest potential for human exposure , EPA concluded that an \nemission level of 250 tons per year of hydrogen chloride -equivale nt per brick facility \nwould be unlikely to result in adverse chronic health effects at any facility in the source category, and would result in exposure concentration levels remaining below \nthe chronic health reference v alues at all facilities.

Environmental \nBr. 44.  This argument fails to acknowledge that the statute does not define how EPA \nmust include an ample margin of safety when setting health -based emission limits \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  Such a margin could be provided  at multiple points in \nthe process.  As Petitioners suggest, EPA could identify an exposure level that is \nbelow the established threshold level at which adverse health effects are not anticipated, and then run its modeling to determine  an emission  level that would \nresult in exposure concentrations at or below that lower health value.  But EPA may \nalso reasonably choose to base its emissions modeling on the established threshold, \nand build a sufficiently health -protective  model such that compliance with  the \nemission lim its should result in exposures below the established threshold level.  \nEither approach would  result in actual exposures that are below the threshold level, \nand either approach therefore provides an ample margin of safety.  EPA\u2019s use of the second approach here  was reasonable.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 7 5,642/3-43/ 1 (concluding \nthat \u201cit would be reasonable to set any [health -based] emission standard for a \npollutant with a health threshold at a level that at least assures that, for the sources in the controlled categ ory or subcategory, persons exposed to emissions of the pollutant \nwould not experience the adverse health effects on which the threshold is based\u201d).

EPA\u2019s method of determining  emission levels based on \nidentified health threshold values provided an ample margin \nof safety.  \nOnce EPA identified health threshold values for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , \nand hydrogen fluoride  below which adverse effects were not expected to occur, it \nmodelled each value  to determine  an emission level  that would result in exposure at or \nbelow the threshold level.  Risk Assessments at 2, JA248, 486.   Importantly, however, \nEPA built several conservative assumptions into its model that it expected would \nresult in actual exposure levels remaining below the threshold level even if a facility emitted at the limit.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3.  This conservative modeling approach \nprovides the \u201cample margin of safety\u201d required by  section 7412(d)(4). \nFirst, EPA based the limits  \u201con the single facility in the source category with \nthe worst-case combination of meteorology and distance to nearest residential receptor that leads to the highest ambient concentrations.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3;  \nBrick Risk Assessment at 6, JA490; Clay Risk Assessment at 3, JA 249.  Because the  \nsame level of emissions at all other facilities will result in lower ambient concentrations, for all but one facility in each source category, the model understates \nthe quantity of emissions that would  be sufficient to cause exposures at the threshol d \nlevel.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3 (explainin g that chronic exposures at approximately \n90 percent of facilities are estimated to be half the threshold level or less).  \nAdditionally, EPA based the limit s on estimated ambient con centrations, which \nassume that people  at the exposure location at all times and do  not leave (to go to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 56 of 135\n-42- \n work or school, for i nstance ).  Id.   Because a  person is unlikely to breathe ambient air \naround the clock at an exposure  location, the model overestimates the average \nexposure to pollutants over time, and thus the risk of exposure at the threshold level, \nfor a person living at an exposure location.  \nThe ample margin of safety thus rests not on an assumption that sources\u2019 \nemissions will be lower than the permitted level, Environmental  Br. 46, but on the \nlikelihood that the conservative assumptions built into EPA\u2019s risk model ing approach \nwill mean that ambient chronic exposures for each facility remain below the threshold \nlevel even if the sources\u2019 emissions are at the maximum permitted level.  EPA \ntherefore reasonably concluded that this modeling approach, and the resultant emission levels that were determined , would ensure an ample margin of safety.   \nMoreover, as discussed su pra at 32-33, EPA\u2019s application of its own reference \nconcentration for hydrogen chloride  as the threshold level, rather than the different \nCalifornia EPA reference exposure level, was fully explained and reasonable, and \ntherefore does not undermine EPA\u2019s separate provision of an ample margin of safety through its modeling process .  Petitioners\u2019 argument that EPA\u2019s use of its own \nreference concentration negates the margin of safety provided by its modeling approach, Environmental Br. 46 -47, is therefore with out merit.

Brick Risk \nAssessment at 17, JA501; Clay Risk Assessment at 12, JA 258.

Reg. 60,898, 60,909 (Oct. 8, 2014)  \n(finding acute hazard quotient value of ten based on reference exposure level value for \nformaldehyde).  Furthermore, EPA\u2019s acute exposure scenario included a  conservative  \nassumption that a person would be present at the location of maximum exposure for \nthe single worst hour of the year in terms of emission levels and meteorological \nconditions.  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501.   \nFinally, EPA found that it was unlikely that a facility would emit only hydrogen \nfluoride and not other acid gases.18  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501; Clay Risk \nAssessment at 12, JA 258.  The brick emission limits allow facilities to emit either 250 \ntons per year of hydrogen chloride , or 175 tons per year of hydrogen fluoride , or 1.9 \n                                                 \n18 This finding is supported by the test data EPA used to set the emission limits.  See \nCover Sheet, \u201cTest run data showing mercury emissions and emissions of hydrogen \nfluoride in relation to other gases\u201d (summarizin g EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0657 \nAppendix B (\u201cBrick Test Data Memo\u201d) and EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0290 -0293 \nAppendix B (\u201cClay Test Data Memo\u201d)), JA923.

EPA\u2019s acute exposure risk assessment for each \nparticular pollutant, however, assumed that a facility was emitting that  pollutant at the \nmaximum permitted level.  In reality, because all brick facilities emit a combination of acid gases and not just hydrogen fluoride, a facility would invariably exceed th e \nhydrogen chloride -equivalent emission limit based on emissions from a combination \nof acid gases before it reached the hydrogen fluoride limit.   See id.  Thus, u nder actual \nconditions, for a facility emitting 250 tons per year or less of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent, the hydrogen fluoride  emissions will be less than those predicted by the \nmodel .  Accordingly, EPA reasonably considered acute health risks when setting a \nhealth -based emission limit for hydrogen fluoride . \nIn short,  Petitioners have presented no basis to conclude that EPA acted \ncontrary to law in identifying health thresholds for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride , and setting emission limits for these pollutants under s ection \n7412(d)(4) . \nII. EPA set MACT  floors based on data reflecting emission levels and using \nthe Upper Prediction Limit . \nA. Introduction  \nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge EPA\u2019s application of an established \nstatistical methodology known as the \u201cUpper Prediction Limit\u201d (\u201cUPL\u201d) to determine  \nMACT floors where EPA had limited emissions information to use in such USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 60 of 135\n-46- \n calculations .  Environmental  Br. 49-53.  As discussed further below, this Court has \nupheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL, and the record here demonstrates that EPA provided \nsufficient explanati on of why application of the UPL to limited datasets is appropriate.  \nAdditionally, EPA reasonably explained its application of the UPL in setting MACT \nfloors in the Brick/Clay Rule.  \nThe CAA  mandates that MACT floor  standards must be no less stringent than  \nthe level of emissi on control achieved by the best-controlled source or sources.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  While such standards also must ensure continuous regulation of the covered sources, id. \u00a7 7602(k), a s this Court has noted, \u201cno source emits any HAP  \nat a constant level; rather, HAP emission s fluctuate over time and for many reasons.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 598.  Most sources  \u201cdo not measure their HAP emission s at all \ntimes and under all conditions,\u201d id. , so EPA must establish MACT standards based on  \nlimited data, generally in the form of \u201cstack tests.\u201d\n19  Stack tests provide a \u201csnapshot\u201d \nof a facility\u2019s emissions in a limited set of conditions.  Id. \nEPA uses the UPL methodology \u201c[t]o compensate for the lack of adequate \nemissions data . . .

This Court included an extensive discussion of the \n                                                 \n19 A stack test typically consists of three separate sampling periods of several hours \neach conducted over one or more  days.  The concentration of tested pollutants is \ndetermined for each sampling event, and the result of the test is the average of the \nthree values for each pollutant.  E.g., 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.8445(e) (incorporating \n\u00a7 63.7(e)(3)).

T o \nestablish a MACT floor using the UPL, EPA :  (1) ranks all sources in each category \nbased on their stack -test data; (2) determines the HAP emission  level of the best-\nperforming source or sources pursuant to section 7412(d)(3); and (3) \u201capplies the \nUPL methodology to provide the cushion necessary to account for the expected peaks and valleys in HAP emissions not reflected in the three -run stack -test \n\u2018snapshots.\u2019\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d  at 598.  \n EPA used the UPL methodology to determine  22 of the brick and 27 of the \nclay MACT floors .

Petitioners challenge EP A\u2019s \napplication of the UPL methodology to limited datasets both in general, and specifically with respect to the emission limits it promulgated in the Brick/Clay Rule .  \nEnvironmental  Br. 49-53.  But EPA has provided ample support for its methodology . \nB. This Court has upheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a general matter.  \nEPA\u2019s use of the UPL was challenged  in two recent cases in this Circuit.  In \nNational Association of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (\u201cNACWA \u201d), which involved \nEPA\u2019s MACT standards for sewage sludge incinerators, this Court remanded certain aspects of the rule for further explanation, including the question of how the UPL \nrepresents the MACT floor for new and existing units.  734 F.3d 1115, 1143  (D.C. \nCir. 2013).  The NACWA  Court did not invalidate the use of the UPL, but rather \nheld that EPA needed to more fully explain why the UPL was appropriate.  Id. at \n1151.  See also U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633.   \nEPA then provided such explanation in its re sponse to a remand of the record \nin challenges to rules for boilers and commercial and industrial solid waste \nincineration units.  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633-34.  In that case, the Court found that \nEPA had \u201cdemonstrate[d] with substantial evidence . . . that the UPL \u2018allows a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 63 of 135\n-49- \n reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units, \u2019\u201d which \nrepresented \u201creasoned decision making\u201d and accordingly was entitled to deference.  \nId. at 636.  The Court concluded that \u201cthe UPL \u2018reflect[s] a reasona ble estimate of the \nemission s achieved in practice by the best- performing sources,\u2019\u201d and upheld EPA\u2019s \ngeneral use of the methodology.  Id. at 639 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 871-72).  \nC. EPA adequately justified the a pplication of the UPL m ethodology \nto limited datasets.  \nThe Court\u2019s opinion in U.S. Sugar  expressly left open the question of whether \nthe UPL is an appropriate statistical method for small datasets.  830 F.3d at 633  n.25.  \nEPA addressed that issue in this Rule in a pair of memoranda setting f orth its general \napproach for applying the UPL to limited datasets, and explaining how that approach was followed in determining  the brick and clay MACT floors.  See Approach for \nApplying the Upper Prediction Limit to Limited Datasets (Sept. 24, 2015), EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2013 -0291- 0661 (\u201cBrick Limited Datasets Memo\u201d) and EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290-0295 (\u201cClay Limited Datasets Memo\u201d)  JA857, 370.   \nAs EPA explained, d etermining the distribution of data is an important \ncomponent of the UPL approa ch, and EPA uses well-established tests of kurtosis and \nskewness\n20 to determine distribution .  Limited Datasets Memos at 1 -2, JA 370-371, \n                                                 \n20 The kurtosis statistic cha racterizes the degree of peakedness or flatness of a given \ndata distribution in comparison to a normal distribution.  The skewness statistic \ncharacterizes the degree of asymmetry of a given data distributio n.  Brick MACT \nFloor Memo at 3 -4, JA 817-818.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 64 of 135\n-50- \n 857-858.  Previously, EPA  used a kurtosis equation that required at least four values \nin a dataset.  Id.   In further reviewing the applic ation of th e UPL to limited datasets, \nhowever, EPA identified another kurtosis estimating equation that provides a \nmeaningful result with as few as three values.  Id .  This equation enables EPA to apply \nthe UPL to smaller datasets. \nAs EPA further explained , to determine sample size thresholds above which \nuse of the UPL does not require further scrutiny, or  below which use of the UPL is \nnot appropriate, EPA considers how a diminishing sample size affects the t-score, \nwhich is \u201ca value that estimates the unce rtainty and variability for a certain confidence \nlevel associated with a specific number of data points.\u201d  Brick Limited Datasets Memo \nat 2, JA858.  As the sample size decreases, t he t-score \u2014and the uncerta inty of the \naverage that is calculated from the av ailable data points \u2014increases.  Id.  As the sample \nsize increases, the relative changes in the t-score become less dramatic, particularly \nonce the sample size is equal to or greater than three .  Id. at 3 (Figure  1, Table 1), 5, \nJA859, 861 .  EPA thus determined that it may be appropriate to use the  UPL to \ndevelop emission limits based on as few as  three datapoints.21  Id. at 2, JA858. \nEven with the use of the alternate kurtosis equation, EPA \u201crecognize[d] that \nthe use of the UPL approach for limited dat asets introduces some amount of \n                                                 \n21 Additionally, because emission tests typicall y include three test runs, the MACT \nfloor dataset size is typically a multiple of three.

USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 65 of 135\n-51- \n uncertainty in the calculation of MACT standar ds.\u201d  Limited Dataset s Memos at 2 , \nJA371, 858 .  Accordingly, EPA  identified addition al steps \u201cto ensure that the level of \nthe MACT standards is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  For MACT floors  based on between three  \nand six test runs, EPA conducts additional, case -by-case evaluation \u201cto ensure that the \nuncertainty associated with a limited dataset does not cause the calculated emission \nlimit to be so high that it does not reflect the average pe rformance of the units upon \nwhich the limit is based after accounting for variability the emissions of those units.\u201d  \nSee id. at 6-8, JA375-377, 862- 864.  That evaluation include s some combination of \n\u201cconfirming that the data distribution was selected correctly; after confirming the data distribution, ensuring that we use the most appropriate UPL equation; and, as necessary, comparing UPL equation components for the individual unit  upon which a \nnew source floor is based with those of the units in the existing source floor to determine if our identification of the best unit is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  EPA thus \nreasonably explained why MACT floors derived from limited datasets can be consid ered adequate, and identified a sufficient case -by-case evaluation process to \nensure that individual MACT floors based on limited datasets are reasonable.   \nPetitioners\u2019 contention  that NACWA precludes the application of the UPL to \nlimited datasets, Enviro nmental Br. 49,  is incorrect.  The NACWA  Court simply \ndirected EPA to explain \u201cwhy the [UPL] could still be considered accurate given a small dataset,\u201d 734 F. 3d at 1144- 45.  EPA in this rule has done exactly what the \nNACWA Court directed , and what the U.S. Sugar  Court found EPA  had successfully USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 66 of 135\n-52- \n done on a more general level:  EPA demonstrated that the UPL can, when applied to \nlimited datasets, still allow a reasonable inference as to the emissions achieved by the \nbest-performing sources , and EPA has adopted a sound analytical process to follow \nwhen it uses the UPL to  determine  a MACT floor and based on limited data.  \nEPA \u201c\u2018typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of data -gathering \nnecessary to solve a problem,\u2019\u201d and is entit led to  deference \u201cwhen it determines how \nbest to meet the technical challenges in its area of expertise.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131).  Here, EPA\u2019s analysis of  the acceptable \nlevel of uncertainty in the determination  of M ACT floors, and its development of a \nprocess to further evaluate and address that uncertainty, are  reasonable .  See \nNACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville, 370 F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club v. EPA, 167 \nF.3d 658, 661-63 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (stating that the CAA doe s not specify how EPA \nmust determine what the best-performing units are achieving, and EPA has \nconsiderable discretion in doing so as long as its methodology is reasonable).     \nD. EPA adequately supported its use of the UPL in the Brick/ Clay \nRule. \nThe Limite d Datasets Memos apply EPA\u2019s evaluative process to brick and clay \nMACT floors involving  limited datasets.  See Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, \nJA864-866; Clay Limited Datasets Memo at 8, JA377 .  EPA had limited datasets for \n18 pollutants and subcatego ries in the brick source category, and for 21 pollutants and \nsubcategories in the clay cera mics source category .  Brick Limited Datasets Memo at USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 67 of 135\n-53- \n 11 (Table 4), JA867; Clay Limited Datasets Memo  at 9 (Table  2), JA378.  For e ach \ndataset, EPA explained that it \u201censur[ed] that [it] selected the data distribution that \nbest re presents each dataset;\u201d \u201censur[ ed] that the correct equation for the distribution \nwas then applied to the data;\u201d and \u201ccompar[ed] individual components of each limited \ndataset to determine if the standards based on limited datasets reasonably represent \nthe performance of the units included in the dataset.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 8 , \nJA377, 864 .  EPA determi ned based on its evaluation that no changes to its usual  \nfloor calculation procedure w ere warranted for the clay MACT floors, and that \nchanges were warranted for five of the brick floors.  Id . \nEnvironmental Petitioners contend that EPA did not adequately explain the \nadjustments made  to five brick floor calculations .  Environmental Br. 52.  They \nfurther assert that EPA improperly made upward adjustments to two of the five \nfloors.  Id.  Both of these arguments fail.  First, for each of the five adjusted MACT \nfloors, the Limited Datasets Memo includes an explanation of how and why EPA made these adjustments.  Se e Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, JA 864-866.   \nFor the new source MACT floor for PM (in pounds per ton) from large tunnel \nkilns, EPA found that it could not accurately determine a representative distribution from the best-performing source because there were only two test runs for that kiln, \nso EPA selected the next best-performing unit and recalculated the UPL based on that unit.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 8, JA864.  For the existing  source MACT \nfloor for PM (in grams per dry square cubic foot) from small tunnel kilns, EPA found USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 68 of 135\n-54- \n that the distribution of the dataset would be better represented by a lognormal \ntemplate , and determined  the MACT floor using that template .  Id. at 8-9, JA864-865.   \nSee also  UPL Memo at 7 -9, JA 509-511 (describing characteristics of normal and \nlognormal distribution curves).   Similarly, for the new source MACT floors for \nmercury (in pounds per ton, micrograms per dry standard cubic meter, and pounds \nper hour), EPA explained that the datasets would be better represented by a \nlognormal distribution and template.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 9-10, JA 865-\n866.  EPA therefore adequately explained the basis for the adjustments. \nFurthermore, EPA reasonably adjusted u pward the floors (in pounds per ton \nand pounds per hour) for mercury emissions from large new kilns.  In arguing that \nEPA\u2019s decision to adjust those floors was arbitrary, Environmental  Br. 52-53, \nPetitioners first fail to note that EPA also made changes to  the mercury floors outside \nthe limited dataset analysis.  As discussed infra  at 75-76 , EPA added a variability factor \nto account for variations in the mercury content of raw material used at brick kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2-3 .  Because the addition of a raw material variability factor \u2014\nwhich Environmental Petitioners do not challenge \u2014introduces more uncertainty into \nthe UPL calculations, it results  in a higher MACT floor.   See Brick MACT Floor \nMemo  at 8-9, JA822-823.  See also  Cover Sheet, \u201cCalculation of Upper Prediction \nLimit before and after addition of mercury variability factor\u201d (summarizing EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2013 -0291 -0660 , Appendices B -1, B2), JA 925-926.  Therefore, the upward \nadjustment of the mercury floors was due at least in  part to the uncontested USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 69 of 135\n-55- \n application of a raw material variability factor .  In any event, w hile the steps outlined \nin the Limited Datasets Memos aim to ensure  that a MACT floor determined  by \napplying the UPL methodology to a limited dataset is not unreason ably high, see Brick \nLimited Dataset s Memo at 6, JA 862, the  specific facts in the record of a given rule \nmay lead to an adjustment either downward or upward to ensure the floor more \naccurately represents the average of the best -performing source or sources .   \nIn short, EPA articulated a reasonable method for ensuring that MACT floors \nbased on limited datasets \u201creflect the average performance of the units upon which \nthe limit is based.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 6 , JA375, 862.  EPA then applied that \nmethod in the case of the brick and clay MACT floors  based on limited datasets.  \nEPA demonstrated that its application of the UPL methodology to limited datasets is reasonable both in general and as applied to the Brick/Clay Rule .  EPA has therefore \nmet the requirement identified in NACWA and U.S. Sugar  that it \u201cdemonstrate [s] \nwith substantial evidence\u2014not mere assertions\u2014that the UPL allows a reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131) (internal quotation marks omitted ).   \nIII. EPA\u2019s use of a lternative emission limits for b rick tunnel kilns was \nreasonable. \nIn the Brick Rule, rather than promulgating a single numeric MACT limit for \neach subcateg ory, EPA gave operators of new and existing tunnel kilns a choice of \nthree alternative emission limits, each expressed in a different unit of measurement, USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 70 of 135\n-56- \n for both mercury and non-mercury metals.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474.   To comply with \nthe mercury emissio n limits , sources could choose one of three  numeric emission \nlimits expressed as mass of pollutant emitted per ton of bricks produced, pounds per \nhour, or concentration (micrograms per dry standard cubic meter).  Id.  at 65,530, \nTable 1.  For non-mercury metals, EPA set a pounds per hour emission limit, and also \nprovided options for limiting PM as a surrogate22 with limits in pounds per ton or \ngrains per dry standard cubic foot.  Id .  This approach \u201c provides  flexibility for the \nregulated c ommunity by allowing a regulated source to choose any control technology \nor technique to meet the emission limits, rather than requiring each unit to use a \nprescribed control method that may not be appropriate in each case.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,633/2.    \nConsistent with the statutory directive to determine  MACT floors based on the \n\u201cbest performing\u201d sources \u201cfor which [ EPA ] has emissions information,\u201d  EPA \ndetermined  the MACT floor for each of the alternative limits using a slightly different \npool of sources .  EPA found  that the composition of the group of top -ranked sources \nvaried depending on the unit of measurement that was appl ied.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/2.  EPA therefore ranked sources  so th at \u201c[e]ach floor [would be] based on \nthe best performing units for that unit of measurement.\u201d  Id .  In other words, as EPA \n                                                 \n22 The use of PM as a surrogate for HAP metals in the context of setting MACT \nfloors  is well -established and not at issue here.  Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 982 \n(quoting Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v. EPA , 233 F.3d 625, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).

Section 7412(d) \ndirects EPA to promulgate \u201c[e]missions standards . . . [that] require the maximum degree  of reduction in emissions,\u201d and requires those standards to be based on the \nbest-performing source or sources for which the Administrator has emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  Nothing in the plain language of the \nstatute forecloses the promulgation of multiple, alternative standards that each independently meets  those requirements.  \nMoreover, the statute does not specify what unit of measurement EPA must \nuse in expressing  its emission  limitations or identifying the best- performing source or \nsources to determine  the MACT floor.   Congress therefore left to EPA\u2019s discretion \nthe selection of an appropriate metric by which to measure sources\u2019 performance.  Inherent in that discretion is the abi lity to set alternative floors based on differ ent \nmetrics.\n23  EPA has considerable discretion in its determination  of MACT floors as \nlong as its methodology is reasonable.  NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville; 370 \n                                                 \n23 EPA has promulgated alternative emission limits pursuant to section 7412(d) in \nseveral other rules.  See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, Subpt. UUU \u00a7 63.1564(a)(1) (setting \nalternative limitations for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units at \npetroleum refineries); Subpt. DDDDD \u00a7 63.7500(a), Tables 1 and 2 (major boilers).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 72 of 135\n-58- \n F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 661- 63.  EPA\u2019s decision to promulgate \nalternativ e limits is therefore reviewable under Chevron  step two, and is entitled to \ndeference so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d  \nChevron , 467 U.S. at 842 -43. \nPetitioners argue that because the alternative floors were not based on identical \nemission levels, they are not equal, and that two of the floors are therefore less stringent.  Environmental Br. 54.  Petitioners further claim that it is impossible for \nmultiple sources or groups of sources to all be the \u201cbest\u201d performing sou rce or group \nof sources unless their emission levels are identical.  Id.  This argument is rooted in an \noverly simplistic conception of when emission limits may be said to be based on the \u201cbest\u201d performing source s.  The alternative floors each reflect the \u201cbest\u201d performing \nsource s because each is based on the best-performing sources for the unit of \nmeasurement for that floor.    \nSimilarly, Petitioners\u2019 contention that the use of alternative floors allows \nregulated facilities to choose the least stringent floor with which to comply, see Environmental  Br. 53, mistakenly assumes that one of the alternative floors is the \nmost or least stringent.  Instead, the relative stringency of the alternative floors is an \napples -to-oranges comparison.  By way of analogy, in a comparison of the most \ntalented professional football, basketball, and baseball players, it would be impossible  \nto determin e which is the best-performing  athlete without establishing  a metric for \nevaluating overall athletic performance.  Furthermore, it is impossible to say that the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 73 of 135\n-59- \n football player who scores the most touchdowns is a better or worse -performing  \nathlete than the  basketball player who makes  the most three -point shots, or than the \nbaseball player who hits  the most home runs, because those metrics are not directly \ncomparable.   Given this, it would be reasonable to set a standard for athleticism that \nrequires an athl ete to have either scored at least a certain number of touchdowns, \nmake  at least a certain number of three -point shots, or hit at least a certain number of \nhome runs.  That athletes could  pick the metric that they are most capable of meeting \nwould  not make  the approach unreasonable.  \nThe same is true when measuring the performance of brick kilns.  For instance, \na smaller facility with fewer kilns may emit a smaller volume of pollutants overall as \nmeasured in pounds per hour, but it may emit more pollutants p er ton of bricks \nproduced.  By contrast, a larger kiln may emit more pollutants as measured in pounds per hour, but may run more efficiently and therefore have lower emissions as \nmeasured in pounds per ton of bricks produced.  See, e.g. , Brick MACT Floor M emo \nat A-2 (Table A-1), A-5 (Table A-2), A-9 (Table A-5), JA830, 833, 837 (showing Kiln \n514 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per ton of PM, Kiln 508 as \nthe top -ranking large kiln as measured by grams of PM per dry square cubic foot, and \nKiln 526 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per hour of non-\nmercury metal HAP).     \nEPA\u2019s decision to set al ternative emission  limitations for brick tunnel kilns was \ntherefore a reasonable exercise of it s discretion under section 7412(d ).  Having USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 74 of 135\n-60- \n decided  to promulgate alternative limits, EPA\u2019s method for calculating those limits \nwas also reasonable.  EPA explained this method and its rationale for calculating each \nMACT floor based on its own unit of measure dataset.  S ee 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2, \n65,507/1.  In  basing each alterna tive limit on the best- performing sources for that \nunit of measurement, EPA satisfied the requirement of section 7412(d)(3 ) to base its \nMACT floors on the best -performing sou rces in a category.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  \nFinally, Petitioners suggest that it was unnecessary for EPA to promulgate \nalternative limits because EPA could have divid ed tunnel kilns into further \nsubcategories (i.e., beyond two subcategories based on size), and then set a single \nemission  limit for each subcategory .  Environmental Br. 55.  While EPA has the \ndiscretion to  further subcategoriz e and considered whether to d o so, see 79 Fed. Reg. \nat 75,634/1, the discretion to identify subcategories does not foreclose the Agency\u2019s \nauthority  to promulgate alternative emission  limits  where appropriate .  \nIV. EPA reasonably considered emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determining major source MACT floors.  \nSynthetic area sources (or \u201csynthetic minor sources\u201d) are sources that have the \npotential to emit HAPs in excess of the major  source threshold, but whose emissions \nhave been controlled to the extent that they fall below  the threshold due to federally -\nenforceable emission  controls.  See Brick Rule Summary of Public Comments and \nResponses at 46 -47 (Sept. 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0685 (\u201cBrick Rule \nRTC\u201d) , JA907-908; 2003 Rule, 68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2.  Consistent with EPA\u2019s USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 75 of 135\n-61- \n interpretation of section 7412, EPA treats such sources as area  sources for \ndeterm ining applicability of emission  standards, but as major sources for other \npurposes.  Because the statute directs EPA to identify the level of control achieved in \npractice by the best-performing  sources, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3), EPA consid ers \nemissions information from synthetic area sources when determining  which sources \nare the best-performing  sources.  EPA continued to use this approach in setting the \nbrick industry standards.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A-6, A-9, A -10 to A -12 \n(Tabl es A-1, A-2, A -5, A-7, A -8, A -9), JA830 -834, 837, 838-840. \nBIA challenges EPA\u2019s inclusion of emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determin ing existing source MACT floors for the PM and mercury \nstandards for large kilns.  Industry Br. 20.  Because BIA did not challenge this  same \napproach to determining MACT floors in the 2003 Rule, see  68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2 -\n98/3, its argument is time-barred.  Med . Waste Inst.  v. EPA, 645 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. \nCir. 2011)  (holding that a challenge to EPA\u2019s approach not raised within sixty days of \nEPA\u2019s first use of the approach was barred).  The argument also fails because EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the ambiguous statutory text is reasonable and consistent with the statute\u2019s structure, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA policy.   \nA. Syntheti c area sources do not fit neatly within the s ection 74 12(a) \ndefinition of either a major s ource or an area s ource . \nSection 7412(a) of the CAA defines a \u201cmajor source\u201d based on a thresh old \namount of HAPs that a source \u201cemits or has the potential to emit considering USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 76 of 135\n-62- \n controls.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1).  A source with the potential to emit at or above the \nthreshold is a major source, and any other source is an area source.  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) , \n(a)(2).  Major sources are treated differently from area sources in certain respects.  See, \ne.g., id. \u00a7 7412(c) (requiring EPA to list all categories of major sources, but only \nrequiring EPA to list area sources in certain circumstances); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(5) (allowing \nEPA to set standards for area sources based on \u201cgenerally available control technologies or management practices\u201d rather than the MACT floor). \nDetermining whether a source should be considered as a major source or an \narea source is not always straightforward.  The definition of a major source includes the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering controls .\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  This phrase is not defined in the statute, and its meaning is ambiguous.  Although this phrase would not matter for determining whether most sources are major sources, it does matter for synthetic area sources.  EPA interprets the phrase to \nshow that consideration of a source\u2019s potential to emit before and after controls is relevant to how the source is treated (in both setting and applying standards).  See 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,509 /1-2.  This interpretation is entitled to considerable deference, as it \nis a permissible construction of a complex statute that is within the agency\u2019s area of expertise.  See Chevr on, 467 U.S. at 842- 43; United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218, \n227-31 (2001).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 77 of 135\n-63- \n B. EPA\u2019s consideration of synthetic area source data is consistent \nwith the CAA and longstanding EPA policy.  \n Section 7412 expresses Congress\u2019s intent that emission standards fo r existing \nmajor sources are based on levels that are actually achieved by the \u201cbest performing\u201d \nexisting sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A) (basing  standards on the \u201cbest \nperforming 12 percent of the existing sources\u201d); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B) (basing  standards \non the \u201cbest performing 5 sources\u201d).  Consistent with this intent, EPA includes \nemission s information from synthetic area sources when determin ing the MACT floor \nfor existing major sources.  Synthetic area sources demonstrate \u201cemission limitation [s] \nachieved\u201d by major sources because their controls have effectively reduced their \nemissions  from above major source threshold levels to below major source threshold \nlevels .  It would be contrary to congressional intent to exclude synthetic area sources \nfrom the MACT floor determination simply because their controls decreased their \nemissions enough to fall below the major  source threshold level.  This approach is \nalso consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history.  See Floor Statement of Sen. \nDurenber ger, 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 870 (clarifying  the intent that EPA collect \u201cdata \non all of the better -performing sources within each category\u201d and ensure that EPA \n\u201cdoes not miss any sources that have superior levels of emission s control\u201d ).  EPA\u2019s \ninclusion of synthetic area sources for p urposes of determining the MACT floor \nensures \u201csources that have superior levels of  emission s control \u201d are considered. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 78 of 135\n-64- \n Further, section 7412(d)(3) expressly exclude s from the MACT floor \ncalculation  those sources that meet the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nof section 7501 .  See 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A), 7501(3).  The express exclusion of \nthose  sources demonstrates that Congress considered the issue of which sources \nshould be excluded from the MACT floor determination , but did not conclude that \nsynthetic area sources should be excluded .  Instead, Congress provided EPA the \nflexibility to include synthetic area sources.  \nEPA has consistently treated synthetic area sources as area sources when \ndetermining the applicability of particular requirements, but as major sources for \ndetermin ing major source MACT floors.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.2 (defining \u201cpotential to \nemit\u201d as the \u201cmaximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its \nphysical and operational design,\u201d and a limitation on the capacity of the source \u201cshall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on \nemissions is federally enforceable\u201d \u2014i.e. , a synthetic area source would not be subject \nto major source stan dards); Memorandum from John S. Seitz to EPA Regions, \nPotential to Emit for MACT Standards \u2013  Guidance on Timing Issues (May 16, 1995) , \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0569  (\u201cSeitz Memo\u201d), JA 441-450 (addressing  when a \nmajor source can become a synthetic area source).  And EPA has included synthetic \narea sources in MACT floor calculations in prior rulemakings.  E.g., NESHAP for \nMunicipal Solid Waste Landfills , 68 Fed. Reg. 2227, 2 232/2 (Jan. 16, 2003); NESHAP USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 79 of 135\n-65- \n for Polyvinyl Chloride and Copolymers  Production , 77 Fed. Reg. 22,848, 22,876/3-\n78/1 (Apr. 17, 2012) . \nC. The CAA allows EPA to treat synthetic area sources as major or \narea sources depending on context.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires exclusion of synthetic area \nsources wrongly assumes that synthetic area sources can never be considered major \nsources for any purpose.  BIA argues that EPA may only use sources \u201cin the \ncategory\u201d to determine the MACT floor for that category , thus excluding synthetic \narea source data from consideration , since they are n ot subject to major source \nstandards .  Industry Br. 19-20 .  BIA\u2019s argument is based on the assumption that a \nsource must be treated as either a major or an area source for every purpose .  As \nexplained above, that is not how EPA interprets the statutory def inition of \u201cmajor \nsource\u201d in the context of  synthetic area sources.   \nContrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, EPA does not \u201cadmit[  ] that synthetic [area] \nsources are not major sources.\u201d  Industry Br. 21.24  EPA has stated that although \nsynthetic area sources \u201care not subject to the requirements imposed on major sources \n. . . that does not equate to a conclusion that they are no longer major sources in any respect.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  EPA considers synthetic area sources to be major \n                                                 \n24 That the standards\u2019 appl ication is \u201climited to brick plants located at a major source ,\u201d \nIndustry Br. 20,  demonstrates only that EPA does not subject synthetic area sources \nto major source standards , which is consistent with EPA\u2019s position.  See 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 63.8385.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 80 of 135\n-66- \n sources in certain respects, such as when EPA identifies the best -performing major \nsources as part of the MACT floor determination.  Id.   Thus, eve n if, as BIA \ncontends, section 74 12(d)(3)(A) requires that all sources considered in determining the \nMACT floor be \u201cin the category,\u201d see Industry Br. 21, synthetic area sources are  major \nsources that are \u201cin the category\u201d for the purpose of determining the MACT floor.  \nFurther, this does not mean that section 74 12(d)(3)(A)\u2019s phrase  \u201cin the category  or \nsubcategory \u201d is meaningless.  The phra se limits the sources that EPA considers.  Here, \nfor example, when setting standards for brick sources, EPA only look ed at the \nemission limitations achieved by brick sources\u2014not the emission limitations achieved \nby tile sources or other non-brick sources.  The phrase also means that brick sources \nthat are true area sources are excluded from major source MACT floor \ndeterminations.  \nNowhere does the statute require that once a source is treated as \u201cin\u201d (or out \nof) a category , it must be treated that way for all purposes.  BIA\u2019s argument that \nCongress excluded sources meeting the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nfrom section 7412(d)(3) because they are \u201cin\u201d the major source category while synthetic area sources are excluded by definition because they are not \u201cin\u201d the major source category only continues to rely on BIA\u2019s preferred interpretation of the statute.  See Industry Br. 22.  EPA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering \ncontrols\u201d  is consistent with Congress\u2019s direction to use the \u201cbest performing\u201d sources \nin the category or subcategory and is entitled to deference.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 81 of 135\n-67- \n Further, this Court has acknowledged that synthetic area sources should not \nnecessarily be treated the same as area sources.  See U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at  650 \n(finding that EPA had not adequately explained \u201cwhy the rationale it used to exempt \nnatural area sources from Title V could be identically applied to synthetic area  \nsources.\u201d).  And for a major source included in more tha n one source category, if the \nsource\u2019s compliance with major  source standards for one source category results in \nthe source\u2019s potential to emit falling below the major  source threshold, EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation allows the source to be treated as a synthetic ar ea source for later-\npromulgated standards for a different source category .  See Seitz Memo at 9-10, \nJA449-450.   This Court should therefore defer to EPA\u2019s reasonable and longstanding \ntreatment of synthetic area sources as major sources for the purpose of determin ing \nthe MACT floor.  \nV. The PM standards are consistent with the statute and rationally \ndeveloped, and EPA adequately responded to BIA\u2019s comments.  \nA. EPA reasonably determined the MACT floor s using the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for which it ha d emissions \ninformation. \nFor a category with 30 or more sources, section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires EPA to \ndetermine  the existing  source MACT floor by calculating  the \u201caverage emission \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sourc es (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 82 of 135\n-68- \n This is precisely what EPA did in determining the MACT floor for PM from existing \nbrick sources.  \nEPA  initially identified two potential approaches for determining the existing \nsource MACT floor for PM emissions from brick sources, and sought information from the brick industry to use in determin ing MACT floors.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,635/1-2, 75,649/1- 2.  The first p roposed approach was based on the possibility \nthat EPA could identify the best- performing 12 percent of sources in the entire \ncategory, in which case the MACT floors could be based on a larger number of \nsources.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,506/3; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1- 2.  At the time of the \nproposal, EPA assumed that kilns with fabric filters would be the best-performing sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1; Analysis of Potential Subcategories for BSCP \nTunnel Kilns at 6 -7 (Nov. 6, 2014)  EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0122 , JA530-531.  \nEPA explained that if  kilns with fabric filters were the best-performing sources and if  \nit had information from all fabric filter -controlled sources, then EPA could identify \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1-2; 80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,506/ 2-3.  Because the category contained 225 sources at the time of \nproposal and 220 when the standards were issued, the best-performing 12 percent of the category would be represented by 27 sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 7 5,635/2 ; Brick \nMACT Floor Memo at 10 (Table  1), JA 824 (showing 122 large kilns and 98 small \nkilns).  EPA expressed concern, however, that although kilns with fabric filters were statistically better -performing as a group, emissions data reflected that some  sources USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 83 of 135\n-69- \n with other or no controls performed better  than some of the fabric filter -controlled \nkilns.  7 9 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1 -2.  EPA therefore requested information on the \nreliability of data showing low emissions from kilns without fabric filters.  Id. \nThe second proposed approach was simply to set  emission limits \u201cbased on the \ntop 12 percent of the data available in each of the kiln size sub categories.\u201d  Id. at \n75,635 n.1; see id. at 75,649/1-2; Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) \nFloor Analysi s for Brick and Structural Clay Products at 11-12, A -5 to A -8 (T ables  A-\n4, A-5) (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0291 -0119 (\u201cProposed Brick MACT \nFloor Memo\u201d ), JA522-523, 525-528.25  EPA proposed  emission  limits under this \napproach, Proposed Brick MACT Floor Memo at 12  (Tables 5, 6), JA523, and  \nrequested comment on  the method of generating th ose limits , and on whether the \navailable-data approach should be used instead of the fabric filter -based approach.  79 \nFed.

EPA noted that the reliabili ty of the data from non-fabric \n                                                 \n25 To determine  MACT floors based on the total number of sources in the category \n(with 30 or more sources), EPA would need sufficient information about all sources \nin the category to conclude that it had emissions data from the best-performing 12 \npercent of sources.  For  example, if a category has 100 sources, EPA could base the \nMACT floors on 12 sources only if it has information to show that those 12 sources are the best performers in the category.  Alternatively, EPA could determine the floor \nbased on 12 percent of the  sources for which it has emissions information.  For \nexample, if EPA has information for only 50 of 100 sources, the MACT floor could be calculated based on the best- performing 6 sources for which EPA has data, even \nthough some of the sources fo r which EP A does not have data  might be better -\nperforming sources.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 84 of 135\n-70- \n filter-controlled  kilns was \u201ca key factor\u201d in determining which approach is \nappropriate.  Id.  at 75,635 n.1.  \nBetween the proposal and the final rule,  EPA did not receive information \nsufficient to exp lain why some non-fabric filter -controlled sources emitted at levels as \nlow as or lower than some sources with fabric filter controls .  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/1.  EPA therefore had no basis for excluding data from those lower -emitting \nnon-fabric filter -controlled sources and thus c ould no longer assume that fabric filter -\ncontrolled sources were the best performers.  Additionally, EPA d id not have \nemissions data from all the fabric filter -controlled sources, so even if it could have \nexcluded the lower emitting data, it would not nece ssarily have had information from \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources in the category .  Id. at 65,484 /3-85/1.  For \nthese reasons, EPA determined  the final PM MACT floors using the best -performing \n12 percent of sources for which it had emissions information.   Id. at 65,485/1-2 .  EPA \nfinalized the standards using subcategories based on kiln size, consistent with the \nsecond  approach it had proposed.  Id.   Because the data showed that some non -fabric \nfilter kilns had lower emissions th an fabric filter -controlled kilns, EPA reasonably \nconcluded that it could not assume that fabric filter -controlled kilns were the best-\nperforming kilns, and EPA appropriately set the PM MACT floors based on the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for whi ch it had emissions information.

The PM MACT standard reasonably represents the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources.  \nBIA\u2019s contention that the PM MACT floors are unrepresentative because the \ndata were skewed toward the best-performing sources, Industry  Br. 24-28, is not \nsupported by the record .  See White Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1247 (considering similar \nallegations, and finding that  \u201casser tions of a biased or irrational data collection \nprocess are not  supported by a review of the record \u201d).  EPA relied on  data from a \nvariety of sources, including responses to EPA surveys, test data compiled during the \n2003 rulemaking, and additional data from Petitioner BIA.

And BIA could have provided emissions data \nfrom more sources.  Although data from fabric filter -controlled sources were a large \nportion of EPA\u2019s dataset, these sources were not consistently the best performers.  \nIndee d, EPA included data from non -fabric filter -controlled sources to determin e the \nMACT floors.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A -9, JA 830-837, (showing non-\nfabric filter -controlled sources ranked in the top twelve percent).  And like the data at \nissue in Wh ite Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1248, here, some of the best-performing sources for \nPM were worse -performing for mercury.  Compare  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 \nto A-6, JA 830-834 with id. at A-10 to A -12, JA838-840.  \nEPA has provided ample support and justificatio n for its  method , and had no \nreason to believe that the lower non -fabric filter emissions data were inaccurate.  See USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 86 of 135\n-72- \n 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,484/3 -85/1 ; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635 /1-2, 75,649/1-2 .  EPA \nproceeded cautiously in questioning the data that were  counter to its expectations and \nrequesting comment, and the  industry responses did not show that the data were \nunreliable.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,48 4/3-8 5/1.  Moreover, contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion \nthat \u201c EPA made no attempt to reconcile the suspicious data ,\u201d Industry Br. 25, EPA \ncontacted kiln owners to request information concerning the test results, requested \ninput from BIA, and undertook a technical review of the data.  See, e.g., Telephone \nContact Summary for Lee Brick (May 2015) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0650 , JA781; \nTelephone Contact Summary for Boral Industries (May 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0291- 0649, JA780; Email from Sharon Nizich to Terry Schimmel and Susan Miller, \nRe: More Information Needed on Kiln Test Reports for Uncontrolled Kilns at 4 -6 \n(June 8, 2015 at 10:42 am), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0607, JA785-787; Brick Test \nData Memo at 6 , JA814.  Therefore, EPA reasonably relied on these  data in \ndetermin ing the PM MACT floors.  \nC. EPA complied with procedural requirements.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that EPA failed to respond to information it provided  \nconcerning  lower emissions data  for some non-fabric filter -controlled sources, \nIndustry Br. 28-29 , lacks merit .  EPA is only required to respond to significant \ncomments.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(6)(B); Covad Commc\u2019ns Co. v. FCC, 450 F.3d 528, 550 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) .  Here, the sole \u201ccomment\u201d that BIA cites is an email providing  a list \nof kilns with short notes on factors BIA suspected might affect the test data, without USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 87 of 135\n-73- \n explaining why the factors might cause the data to be unrepresentative of the kiln\u2019s \nemissions.  See Email from Susan Miller to Sharon Nizich, DLA/Uncontrolled Kilns \n(June 25, 2015 at 2:43 pm ), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0614, JA788 (listing notes  \nsuch as \u201c[i]nitial MACT compliance test- suspect all new limestone\u201d).  This  can hardly \nbe considered a legally significant comment.  Indeed, BIA\u2019s explanation of these \nfactors in its b rief provides more explanation than was provided  in its email.  See \nIndustry Br. 28 -29.   \nFurthermore, the information in BIA\u2019s email would not have chan ged how \nEPA determin ed the MACT floors.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(8) (\u201cIn reviewing alleged \nprocedural errors, the court may invalidate the rule only if the errors were so serious \nand related to matters of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made.\u201d).  In the absence of additional evidence, BIA\u2019s identification of factors \nthat it suspected might  potentially indicate unrepresentative emission s data would not \nhave provided sufficient justification for EPA to exclude data from low -emitting \nsources without fabric filter controls.  BIA did not show that the non -fabric filter data \nwere unreliable, nor did it provide additional data so that EPA could conclude that it \nhad information from all best -performing sources.  Without such evidence, EPA \ncould not have justified using data from 12 percent of sources in the industry \u2014i.e., \nfrom more than the top-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had emi ssions \ndata\u2014in finalizing the fabric filter-based proposed standards.  80 Fed.

The mercury standards for the brick industry are consistent with the \nstatute and congressional intent.  \nContrary to BIA\u2019s  argument, Industry Br. 29 -39, EPA determin ed the mercu ry \nMACT floor for the brick industry exactly as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  \nLegislative history cited by  BIA does not negate what the statute and case law require.  \nFurther, EPA reasonably found that sources can comply with the standard through means other than switching raw materials (although no such finding is necessary).  \nFinally, EPA reasonably declined to establish subcategories based on raw materials.  \nA. EPA appropriately determined the MACT floors for mercury and \nset standards at the floor leve ls. \nAs this Court has emphasized, \u201cEPA may not deviate from section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s \nrequirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve.\u201d  Sierra  Club, \n479 F.3d at 880 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cWhen setting the MACT floor, [  ] EPA considers only the performance of \nthe cleanest sources in a category . . . it does not take into account other factors, \nincluding the cost of putting a source in line with its better -performing counterparts.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 89 of 135\n-75- \n In its decision vacating the 2003 Rule, this Court held that where EPA had \nfound that raw material content has an appreciable effect on HAP emissions from \nbrick kilns, EPA could not set MACT floors based solely on the use of p ollution \ncontrol technology.  Sierra Club,  479 F.3d at 882- 83.  The Court stated that a purely \ntechnology -based approach would satisfy the CAA \u201cif pollution control technology \nwere the only  factor determining emission levels of that HAP.\u201d  Id.  at 882 (quoting \nCement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 863) (internal quotation marks and further citations omitted).  \nBy contrast, if factors other than technology \u201cinfluence a source\u2019s performance, it is not sufficient that EPA consider [ ] sources using only . . . MACT controls.\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 864- 65).     \nHere, EPA determined the mercury MACT floors for brick kilns by calculating \nthe emissions from the best-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had \nemissions information, as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  EPA set standards for \ntwo subcategories, small kilns and large kilns, and allowed kilns to use one of three \nalternative measurements to comply.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 /2-3, Table 4.  EPA set \nthe mercury standards under section 7412(d)(3) at the MACT floor level because it \nfound that more stringent limits (whi ch would have to be based on a beyond -the-floor  \nanalysis under section 7412(d)(2)) were \u201cnot reasonable relative to the level of emission reduction achieved\u201d due to the costs of addition al controls.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,638/2.  Further, because mercury emissions result from the mercury content in the raw clay used, and mercury content varies by the location where clay is quarried, EPA USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 90 of 135\n-76- \n developed a variability factor for mercury content in r aw clay and incorporated it into \nthe UPL equation used to determine the MACT floors.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2 -3.  \nAs a result, the final mercury standards are less stringent than the proposed standards.  \nCompare  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,628  Table 4 (proposing m ercury standards for large kilns as \n0.00002 2 pounds per ton) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 Table 4 (finalizing mercury \nstandards for large kilns as 0.000041 pounds per ton).  EPA  also noted that the \nmercury standards provide flexibility for sources by \u201callow ing a regulated source to \nchoose any control technology or technique to meet the emission limits, rather than \nrequiring each unit to use a prescribed control method.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,633/2.  \nSee also Brick Rule RTC at 27, JA 901 (\u201c[I]t is up to each fac ility to determine the type \nof emission control that works best for their particular situation.\u201d).  \nBIA\u2019s arguments that the mercury standards are invalid proceed from the \nincorrect assumption that EPA must ensure that all sources are able to achieve MACT \nfloor-based standards.  But that is not what the CAA requires.  Rather, this Court has \nclarified that the MACT floors must be set regardless of whether all sources can achieve them.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (stating that section 7412(d)(3) \u201climits the \nscope of the word \u2018achievable\u2019 in section 7412(d)(2),\u201d and  that \u201cEPA may not deviate \nfrom section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve by claiming that floors must be achievable by all sources using MACT technology\u201d);  Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v.

EPA\u2019s finding that sources could install controls or switch raw \nmaterials to meet the standards  was not a basis for the standards , \nbut was reasonable.  \nIn its response to comments, EPA noted that activated -carbon injection \ncontrol devices were an available compliance option for brick kilns.  See Brick Rule \nRTC at 13, 26-27, JA 894, 900-901.  BIA argues that because no sources in the \nindustry use such  devices to reduce mercury emissions, and EPA has not shown that \nthey would be effective, the controls are not a realistic compliance option, so that \nEPA has effectively required brick facilities to switch raw materials.  Industry Br. 30 -\n32. \nIn fact, the record fully supports EPA\u2019s statements concerning the \neffectiveness of activated carbon injection controls.  See  Brick Rule RTC at 26-27, \nJA900-901 (noting proven ef fectiveness of controls in similar industries and noting \nlack of evidence that controls would interfere with operation of brick sources).  See also Methodology and Assumptions Used to Estimate the Model Costs and Impacts of \nBSCP Air Pollution Control Devices for the Final Rule at 7 -9 (Sept. 24, 2015) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0662  (\u201cBrick Cost Memo\u201d), JA 870-872 (consider ing activated \ncarbon injection controls in the cost analysis).  Activated carbon injection controls \nhave proven effective in controlling mercur y emissions from similar sources in other \nindustries.  Brick Rule RTC  at 13, JA 894.  EPA has used its technical expertise to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 92 of 135\n-78- \n reasonably determine that such controls would be effective for the brick industry as \nwell.  That technical determination is entitle d to considerable deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.  Therefore, there is no basis for BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe \nonly available means of controlling mercury emissions is raw material substitution.\u201d  Industry Br. 32.   \nIn any event, as explained supra in Section VI.A , EPA does not need to \ndetermine how sources can meet the MACT floor, let alone whether  sources can meet \nthe MACT floor at all.  BIA\u2019s statement that EPA asserts that brick plants could meet the standard by \u201c switching to clay with lower mercury content,\u201d Industry Br. 30, \nwrongfully assumes that EPA\u2019s assertion  could have any bearing on the level s at \nwhich MACT floor -based standards were set.  While EPA noted in its cost analysis \nthat \u201cif significant amounts of  mercury are found at one location onsite, material \nfound at another onsite location with a lower mercury content could be used,\u201d Brick \nCost Memo at 9, JA 872, EPA  explained elsewhere that it was  \u201cnot requiring the use \nof offsite raw materials in this rule. \u201d  Brick Rule RTC  at 26, JA 900.  Stating that \nsources may be able to comply if they switched raw materials does not amount to a requirement.  But even if EPA had found that switching clays was the only way sources could comply with the standard s, that find ing would not have allowed EPA to \nset less stringent standard s, because the standard s are already at the MACT floor level.  \nSee Sierra  Club, 479 F.3d at 880.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 93 of 135\n-79- \n C. The CAA legislative history do es not prohibit raw material \nsubstitution requirements for brick kil ns. \nLargely ignoring the statutory text and this Court\u2019s decision in Sierra Club, BIA \nargues that legislative history indicates that EPA may not require raw materials \nsubstitution for brick kilns.  See Industry Br. 33 -34.  As explained supra in Sections \nVI.A and VI.B, this argument proceeds from the flawed premises that EPA must \nexplain how all sources could meet the standards, and that all sources must meet the \nstandards through raw material substitution.  E ven if BIA\u2019s premises were correct, \nthis argument would lack merit.   \nTo support its position, BIA c ites an explanatory statement in a Conference \nReport for the 1990 Amendments, which states that in setting standards for categories \nof sources \u201cengaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and pr ocessing of \nnonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in -process materials, the \nAdministrator shall not consider the substitution of, or other changes in, metal - or \nmineral -bearing raw materials that are used as feedstocks or materials i nputs, or metal - \nor mineral -bearing materials processed or derived from such feedstock s or materials.\u201d  \nIndustry Br. 33 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101 -952 at 339 , 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 1989).  \nHowever, the clear language of the statute requires EPA to determi ne the MACT \nfloor by estimating the emissions actually achieved by the best-performing existing sources.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (\u201cEPA may not deviate from section \n7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 94 of 135\n-80- \n achieve.  . . .\u201d).  The statutory language provides no allowance to set the MACT floor \nat a less stringent level if some sources would otherwise need to switch raw materials.  \nIndeed, Sierra Club held that MACT floors could not be justified by the Agency\u2019s \n\u201cconcer n that floors based on clean clay would be unachievable.\u201d  479 F.3d at 883.   \nBIA\u2019s request for en banc  review of Sierra Club or an Irons  footnote , Industry Br. \n38, is unjustified because no  prior conflicting  holdings are a t issue .  See Irons v. \nDiamond, 6 70 F.2d 265, 267-68, n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1981) .  As in the cases BIA cites, \n\u201c[t]his case does not present the very rare situation where the legislative history  of a \nstatute is more probative of congressional intent than the plain text.\u201d  Consumer Elecs. \nAss\u2019n v.

Here, interpreting \nthe legislative history to deviate from the plain text of the CAA\u2019s MACT floor \nrequirements would uproot not only the holding of Sierra Club , but also this Court\u2019s \nlongstan ding precedent that MACT floors must be set at the lowest levels achieved.   \nFinally, while the directive of the statute is clear, the legislative history is not.  I t \nis not apparent that the statement even intended to refer to and include the brick industry among industries \u201cengaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and \nprocessing of nonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in -process USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 95 of 135\n-81- \n material s.\u201d  Although brick facilities could  be considered as \u201cprocessing\u201d clays and \nshales to produce bricks, it is not clear that these clays and shales are among the types \nof raw materials identified in the statement.26  Therefore, the plain language of the \nstatute, not legislative history, controls.  \nD. EPA\u2019s decision not to establish subcategories based on raw \nmaterials is rational and entitled to deference.  \nAt the time of proposal, EPA stated that it would consider subcategorizing \nbased on the mercury content of raw materials if data were provided showing \u201ca \ncorrelation between raw material content and mercury emissions and . . . sharp \ndisparities in raw material mercury content that readily differentiate among types of \nsources.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,650/3-51/1.  E PA specifically requested \u201cmercury \nemissions data coupled with raw materials mercury data.\u201d  Id.  at 75,651/1.  During the \nrulemaking , however, although EPA assumed a correlation existed between the \nmercury content of clay and mercury emissions, EPA did not  receive sufficient data to \nsubcategorize on that basis.  Brick Rule RTC at 13, JA 894.  Because emissions data \n                                                 \n26 If the legislative history were to have any controlling weight, it would only be to \nlimit EPA\u2019s considerations when setting beyond -the-floor standards for specific \nindustries.  This is because sect ion 7412(d)(2) allows EPA to consider ways in which \nsources could reduce emissions, such as materials substitution, in setting standards \nmore stringent than MACT floors.  And contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 34, \nthis interpretation is consistent w ith how EPA considered legislative history in a prior \nrulemaking.  See Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 988 (discussing EPA\u2019s decision not to \nset beyond- the-floor standards for copper smelters based in part on legislative history).  \n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 96 of 135\n-82- \n were collected years prior to data on raw material content,27 and because the mercury \ncontent of clay varies even within a quarry, see Mercury Con tent of Oklahoma and \nOhio Shale Deposits Supplying the Brick Industry at 6, 9 (T ables 1,  2) (Sept. 23, \n2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291-0659, JA805, 808, EPA could not demonstrate a \ncorrelation between the mercury content in the raw materials and mercury emissi ons.  \nAccordingly, EPA reasonably concluded that it could not justify subcategorization \nbased on raw material content.  \nBIA contends that subcategorization would \u201censure that MACT floors are truly \n\u2018achievable\u2019\u201d and would \u201cavoid the need for raw material sub stitution.\u201d  Industry Br. \n37.  As stated above, h owever, there is no requirement that MACT floors be \nachievable by all sources,28 nor has EPA required material substitution.  EPA \nexplained what data it would need to justify subcategories, but then  determine d that it \ndid not receive enough information to justify that approach.  EPA\u2019s decision not to \nsubcategorize based on raw materials is rational and entitled to deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.   \n                                                 \n27 While the most recent mercury emission test was conducted in 2011, see Cover \nSheet, \u201cTest run data showing mercury emissions and emissions of hydrogen fluoride \nin relation to other gases,\u201d JA924, the samples for raw material content were collected \nbetween 2013 and 2015.

Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.   \nTCNA incorrectly claims that \u201c [t]he legitimacy of the promulgation is dependent \nupon TCNA\u2019s right to judicial review challenging it.\u201d  Industry Br. 18.  Rather, TCNA \nmust affirmatively establish its right to seek judicial review before its arguments may be considered.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at  560.

But any such \ndemonstration would undermine TCNA\u2019s argument t hat EPA inappropriately \npromulgated the standards.  Accordingly, TCNA has not identified a single member who is or will be harmed, and has failed to allege specific facts sufficient to prove it has standing.  See Industry Br. 17 -18, Attachment B; Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n , 497 \nU.S. 871, 888 (1990) (holding \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d are insufficient to establish standing); Sierra Club v. EPA , 292 F.3d 895, 899 ( D.C. Cir. 2002) (finding petitioner\u2019s \nburden to prove standing is the same as a plaintiff\u2019s bur den at summary judgment).  If \nTCNA views the \u201chypothetical possibility\u201d of a future source becoming subject to the standards as so remote as to preclude EPA from promulgating the standards, then TCNA lacks standing to challenge them.  And as discussed infr a in Sections VIII -XII, \nTCNA\u2019s arguments fail on the merits even if this Court determines that TCNA has \nstanding.  \nVIII.  EPA complied with the CAA in setting standards for major sources in \nthe tile industry.  \nTCNA argues that the CAA requires that EPA issue standa rds under section \n7412(d)  only if it finds that there are major sources in the category that would be \nsubject to the standard s.  Industry Br. 39 -44.  This argument lack s merit.  EPA \nappropriately determined that there were major sources in the listed categ ory at the \ntime of listing, consistent with CAA requirements.  A fter EPA properly listed the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 99 of 135\n-85- \n category, the CAA required it to promulgate major source standards for sources in \nthat category.  Accordingly, EPA properly issued standards for the tile industry.     \nA. EPA set standards for major sources in the tile industry consistent \nwith CAA requirements.  \nIn the 1990 CAA amendments, Congress requ ired EPA to publish an initial \n\u201clist of all categories . . . of major sources,\u201d and certain area sources of HAPs.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1), (c)(3).  To supplement its initial list, EPA \u201cmay at any time list \nadditional categories . . . according to the same criteria for listing\u201d applicable under section 7412(c)(1) and (c)(3).  Id. \u00a7 7412(c)(3).   For major sources, the only \u201c criter [ion] \nfor listin g\u201d is that the category contain  major sources of HAPs.  See id.  Any person \ncan petition to have a category deleted  from the list, and EPA may delete a category \nonly if it makes certain determinations specified in section 7412(c)(9).  Id.  \u00a7 7412(c)(9); \nNew Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574, 578-79, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  Otherwise, once a category is listed, EPA must establi sh emission standards for major sources in that \ncategory.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (c)(5), (d)(1), (e)(1); see Sierra Club v. EPA, 850 F. \nSupp. 2d 300, 304 (D.D.C. 2012).   \nEPA promulgated  the Clay Rule consistent with those requirements.  In 1992, \nEPA pub lished the initial list of source categories, which included a \u201cclay products \nmanufacturing\u201d source category.  Notice of Initial List of Categories of Sources under Section 112(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 57 Fed. Reg.  31,576, 31,591/3 \n(Table 1) (July 16, 1992).\n  In 2002, in addition to proposing standards, EPA provided USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 100 of 135\n-86- \n notice that it had replaced the clay products manufacturing source category on the \nsource category list with two source categories: brick and structural clay products manufacturing  and clay ceramics manufacturing.

Reg. 47,894, 47,896/2-3  (July 22, 2002) .\n29  The \u201cclay ceramics \nmanufacturing source category i nclude s those facilities that manufacture pressed floor \ntile, pressed wall tile, and other pressed tile; or sanitaryware.\u201d  Id.  at 47,913/3.  EPA \nfinalized clay ceramics standards in 2003, 68 Fed. Reg. 26,690, and existing major sources in the tile industr y were subject to the standards starting in 2006, until this \nCourt vacated the standards in 2007.  See 68 Fed. Reg. at 26,716/1; Sierra Club, 479 \nF.3d at 876. \nThe clay ceramics manufacturing category remained a listed source category \nnotwithstanding this Court\u2019s vacatur of the 2003 Rule , and therefore, EPA was still \nrequired to promulgate standards for major sources in the category.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(c)(2), (e)(1); See Sierra Club, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 304.  Accordingly, EPA properly \npromulgated standards for major tile industry sources in the Rule under review.   \n                                                 \n29 EPA had provided notice in 1999 that it anticipated reevaluating the clay products \nmanufacturing category and replacing it with four categories, including a clay ceramics \nmanufacturing category.

EPA anticipated that each category would be added to the list \n\u201c[w]hen each of the standards is propose d.\u201d  Id.

EPA had authority to set major source standards for the tile \nindustry even when no sources are subject to the standards.  \nBy August 27, 2014, just months before EPA re -proposed major source \nstandards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category, all sources in the tile industry \nthat would otherwise have been subject to the  standards had either closed or become \nsynthetic area sources.

In the final rule, EPA responded to \ncomments and appropriately concluded that, because the category contained major sources when it was listed, and because EPA is required to set standards for listed \n                                                 \n30 In 2003, EPA projected that four tile industry sources would be subject to major \nsource standards.

Since 2003, several  tile industry sources have changed their status:  one \nmajor source closed; three major sources became synthetic area sources; two area \nsources \u201cbriefly became major sources\u201d before becoming synthetic area sources; and \none new major sour ce became a synthetic area source.

Industry Br. 39.  In other words, TCNA interprets subse ctions 7412(c)(1), \n(c)(2), and (d) to prohibit  EPA from setting standards for a listed source category \nunless major existing sources that will be subject to the standards remain in the listed \ncategory at the time of the standard s\u2019 promulgation.  Id. at 40.   This interpretation is \ninconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain text.   \nThe CAA  clearly provides that EPA must promulgate standards for listed \ncategories, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (e)(1), absent a decision to delist (see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(c)(9)).  Further, it is at the time of listing that EPA\u2019s determination that there are \nmajor sources in the category is relevant.  As explained supra in Section VIII.A, EPA  \nis required to list categories of major sources, and it is the listing of a category that triggers EPA\u2019 s obligation to set standards.  The CAA does not require EPA to \nreevaluate its decision to list a category before issuing standards.\n31  Indeed, this Court \n                                                 \n31 TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA interprets the statute to allow major source \n\u201cregulations for every existing or imaginable  industry, regardless of whether a major \nsource had been or would ever exist in the industry,\u201d Industry Br. 42, is incorrect.  \nRather, EPA interprets the statute to only direct it to list categories of major sources \nwhen the categories contain major source s.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at 31,579/3 (noting that USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 103 of 135\n-89- \n has considered unlawful EPA\u2019s removal of a source category from the list on any \nbasis other than th ose provided in section 7412(c)(9) , which does not authorize \ndelisting on the basis of a  finding that the source category no l onger contains major \nsources.  New Jersey , 517 F.3d at 582- 83. \nNor is there any reason to doubt that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation i s \nconsistent with congressional intent.  Congress required EPA to set standards for \nboth existing sources and new sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d) .  In requiring EPA to \nset standards for new  major sources, Congress clearly contemplated that EPA could \nset standards that might never apply, as it is possible that no new major sources would \nbe built in a source category.  \nFurther, even if no major existing sources are subject to the major source \nstandards when they are promulgated, those standards can still hav e environmental \nbenefits.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,508/3 -09/3 .  First, major sources in a given category may \nchoose to become synthetic area sources before major source standards go into effect, see Seitz Memo at 5 -7, JA 445-447, thus reducing th ose sources\u2019 emissions in advance \nof the reductions required by the standards.  Second, having major source standards \n                                                 \nEPA only listed categories of major sources \u201cwhere there was reasonable certainty \nthat at least one stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources \nin the category are commonly located on the premises of major sources\u201d).  Further, \nTCNA does not, and cannot , contend that major sources never existed  in the tile \nindustry.  See, e.g., Updated Inventory Database and Documentation fo r Clay Ceramics \nProposed Rule at 1 -3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0290- 0222 , JA264 -266 \n(describing  major tile industry sources); Astrachan Letter  at 1, JA261 (stating that \nformer major sources in the tile industry had become synthetic area sources). USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 104 of 135\n-90- \n in effect may deter natural area sources and synthetic area sources from increasing \ntheir emissions to avoid becoming subject to the major source standard s.  See Industry \nBr. Attachment B \u00b6\u00b6  5-7.  In the absence of major source standards, area and \nsynthetic area sources  might  have an incentive to increase emissions to become major \nsources.  And, as EPA explained, this incentive is greater when sources are a lready \nsubject to area source standards.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  Further, if EPA were required to identify a source emitting at major source levels at the time of setting standards , as preferred by TCNA , then it is possible that sources emitting at maj or \nsource levels could become synthetic area sources during the rulemaking process to head off the promulgation of major source standards.  See id.  Indeed , after EPA listed \nthe clay ceramics manufacturing  source category, and while EPA was in the process of \nsetting these standards, the remaining major sources in the tile industry become synthetic area sources.  See Astrachan Letter , JA260-262; Updated Inventory Database \nand Documentation for Clay Ceramics Proposed Rule  at 2-3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013 -0290- 0222 , JA265-266  (showing changes in tile industry sources\u2019 \nstatus).\n32  Under TCNA\u2019s interpretation, EPA would have to hold off on setting \nstandards for the listed source category until it could again identify a source emitting \n                                                 \n32 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, the distinction between a major sour ce and an area \nsource is not as clear as it may at first seem.  See supra Section IV.A.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 105 of 135\n-91- \n at major source levels,  at which point the source could become a synthetic area source \nand (again) foreclose EPA from setting standards.   \nIn addition to creating a regulatory loophole that would prevent EPA from \nsetting appropriate major source standards,33  TCNA\u2019s interpretatio n would be \nincredibly inefficient, as EPA would possibly need to rework or abandon proposed \nstandards every time sources changed their status.  In short, even if there were any \nambiguity in the statute (and there is not), EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable, and should be upheld under Chevron  step two.\n34 \nC. EPA complied with notice and comment procedures in issuing the \nstandards.  \nTCNA argues that it \u201cwas never afforded the opportunity to comment\u201d on \nEPA\u2019s position that listed sources must be regulated, and that it \u201chad no reasonable \nnotice of this position\u201d from the proposal.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA also argues that \n                                                 \n33 TCNA asserts that there is no such loophole because section 7412(j) applies to \nrequire case -by-case emission limits when section 7412(d) standards have been \nvacated, and cites a 2010 proposal to revise EPA\u2019s section 7412(j) rule as support.  \nIndustry Br. 41 n.6.  However, case -by-case standards are intended to be a stopgap for \nthe period of time before EPA promulgates standards for a source category, not a \npermanent su bstitute for source category standards.  Further, the existence of section \n7412(j) does not change EPA\u2019s duty to promulgate section 7412 standards for the clay \nceramics category.  See  Sierra Club, 850 F. Supp. 2d. at 304.  \n \n34 Additionally, because EPA did not act beyond the scope of the CAA, there is no \nlegitimate constitutional challenge to EPA\u2019s actions.  See Industry Br. 44 (arguing that \nEPA violated Article II).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 106 of 135\n-92- \n EPA\u2019s position was not a logical extension of the proposal.  Id.  at 46-47.  TCNA is \nwrong on all counts.   \nFirst, when EPA proposed standards in 2014, EPA specifically requested \ncomment on whether it must set major source standards for the tile industry in light \nof the fact that all of the major sources had become synthetic area sources.  79 Fed. \nReg. at 75,665/ 2-3.  But EPA also noted that it was required to set standards for the \nlisted clay ceramics manufacturing source category pursuant to section 7412(c), and \nthat the D.C. District Court had already found EPA\u2019s mandatory duty to set standards \nfor this listed  source category remained in place after vacatur of the 2003 Rule.  Id. at \n75,627/1-2.  Further, EPA\u2019s longstanding position, as reflected in its initial 1992 listing notice, is that the CAA requires EPA to set standards for listed sources.  See 57 \nFed. Re g. at 31,577/ 3.  In any event, EPA made clear it was proposing to set \nstandards for major sources in the tile industry, and TCNA had ample opportunity to \ncomment on all aspects of whether such regulation was legally appropriate.  See 79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,657- 58 (Tables 10,  11).   \nIX. TCNA cannot now challenge EPA\u2019s listing of the major source \ncategory, and its challenge is without merit.  \nA. TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing is untimely.  \nTCNA challenges EPA\u2019s section 7412(c) listing of the major source category \ncontain ing the tile industry.  EPA agrees that section 7412(e)(4) prohibits legal \nchallenges to EPA\u2019s decision to list categories of major sources prior to the issuance USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 107 of 135\n-93- \n of emission  standards.35  See Industry Br. 45.  However, TCNA\u2019s challenge to the \nlisting decisi on is un timely.  As provided in section 7412(e)(4), the time to challenge \nthe listing of a source category arises \u201cwhen the Administrator issues emission \nstandards for such . . . category.\u201d  With respect to the clay ceramics category, that occurred in 2003 , when EPA promulgated the initial Brick/Clay Rule.  At that time, \nTCNA had 60 days to challenge the category\u2019s listing.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(b)(1).  TCNA \ndid not do so.  Having waived its arguments concerning the validity of the listing \ndecision after the standards were issued in 2003, TCNA cannot now assert them.  The vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not change or affect the prior listing , and does not \nchange TCNA\u2019s inability to raise this argument.  Petitioners had an opportunity to challenge the listing and fa iled to pursue any timely challenge.  \nFurther, it would be nonsensical to read Section 7412(e)(4) to allow litigants to \nreassert challenges to the listi ng decision every time emission  standards are issued, \nreissued or revised for a category.  Section 7412( e)(4) is more reasonably read to allow \nEPA to list categories of major sources of HAPs and begin the process of setting emission  standards for those categories without interruption from protracted \nlitigation.  In short, Congress provided an opportunity to challenge listing decisions, \n                                                 \n35 Section 7412(e)(4) states that \u201cno action of the Administra tor . . . listing a source \ncategory or subcategory under subsection (c) of this section shall be a final agency \naction subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be reviewed under \nsubsection 7607 of this title when the Administrator issues emission standards for \nsuch . . . category.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(e)(4).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 108 of 135\n-94- \n even though it delayed judicial review of the listing of a category until after emission \nstandards for that category were issued, but Congress limited the timeframe for \nchallenges  to EPA\u2019s actions.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss TCNA\u2019s challenge \nto the listing decision as untimely, and need not reach the merits of this issue.  \nB. EPA\u2019s listing of the major source category was proper.   \nEven if TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing were timely, it would fail on the merits.  \nTCNA claims that the listing was not adequately supported, and was unlawfully \nfinalized because EPA failed to provide notice and an opportunity to comment.  Industry Br. 44 -47.  TCNA is wrong on both counts.  \n1. EPA adequately supported its basis for the listing.  \nTCNA argues that there must be a \u201ccitation in the relevant EPA docket to a \nmajor source\u201d in the tile industry before EPA can promulgate section 7412(d) standards for the industry.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA cites the initial 1992 listing notice \nand claims that  the docket contains no citation to any sources in the ceramic tile \nmanufacturing industry.  Id.   This argument misses the mark.  EPA replaced the 1992 \nlisting of the clay products manufacturing category with the listing of the clay \nceramics manufacturing category in 2002, at the same time that it proposed setting \nstandards for the listed category.  Because the 2002 listing superseded the 1992 listing, any challenge TCNA would have to the listing would be to EPA\u2019s 2002 decision.  See 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/ 2-3.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 109 of 135\n-95- \n When EPA listed the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2002, it had \nample information to conclude that sources in that category, including tile industry sources , \nwere major sources.  See supra  note 30; 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,91 3/3-1 4/1; Documentation \nof Database of Responses to the 1997 EPA Information Collection Request for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing  at 306-09 (Table 11) (Dec. 6, 2001), A-2000- 48; II -B-20, \nJA205-208 (showing four major sources in the tile industry).  And the fact that there \nwere major sources at the time of listing cannot be disputed.  Further, prior to the promulgation of the 2003 Rule, EPA received no comments challenging t he listing of \nthe category based on the absence of major tile industry sources.  See generally 2003 \nClay Rule Summary of Public Comments and Responses (Feb. 2003) , A-2000-48, IV -\nA-1 (\u201c2003 Clay Rule RTC \u201d), JA214.   \nEven if TCNA could challenge the initial 1992 listing, whether the docket for \nthe initial list identifies any ceramic tile manufacturing sources has no effect on the \nvalidity of the listing, because the listed category at that time was clay products \nmanufacturing.\n36  EPA needed only to conclude th at there were major sources in the \ncategory it listed , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(c)(1),  and EPA did just that.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at \n31,591/3 (Table 1), 31,592/3 n.a.  EPA\u2019s rationale for listing all categories, including \nclay products manufacturing, was based on \u201cr easonable certainty that at least one \n                                                 \n36 TCNA is careful to describe its challenge to the listing based on a lack of material in \nthe docket \u2014rather than claiming that major sources in the tile industry did not exist \nat that time\u2014presumably because it could not credibly asse rt that there were not \nmajor til e industry sources at the time.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 110 of 135\n-96- \n stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources in the category \nare commonly located on the premises of major sources.\u201d   Id. at 31,579/3.  And EPA \nexplicitly found that it had \u201cinformation indicating that [the clay products manufacturing] source category contains a major source.\u201d  Documentation for \nDeveloping the Initial Source Category List, Final Report at B-45 (July 1992) , A-90-\n49, IV -A-55/V-B-1, JA928.  Although the tile industry would later be described as \npart of the initially- listed clay products manufacturing category, see supra at 85-86, \nthere is no requirement that at the time EPA listed the category, it had to identify major sources of every industry that might later be co nsidered part of that initially -\nlisted category.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1) (requiring publication, and revision if \nappropriate, of a list of categories of major sources).\n37  Therefore, EPA\u2019s 1992  listing \nof the cla y products manufacturing category as a major source category pursuant to \nsection 7412(c)(1) was valid . \n                                                 \n37 EPA explained that in proposing standards for each category, it planned to revise \nthe list and better describe the industries in each categ ory.  57 Fed. Reg. at 31,590/3 -\n91/1.  This approach ensured that as EPA accumulated information and developed \nproposed standards for a category, it could properly describe the sources within the \nlisted category that would be subject to the standards.  See, e.g., 67 Fed. Reg. at \n47,896/2-3, 47,898/3- 99/2, 47,913/3-14/1 (replacing one initially-listed category with \ntwo categories and describing sources in those categories).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 111 of 135\n-97- \n 2. TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the 2002 \nlisting decision in the rulemaking for the 2003 Rule.  \nTCNA had notice and an opportunity to comment on the listing in 2002, when \nEPA  proposed standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category.38  67 Fed. \nReg. at 47,896/ 2-3.  Providing notice of and opportunity to comment on the listing at \nthe time standards are proposed is consistent with section 74 12(e)(4), which provides \nthat the window  for judicial review commences when EPA issues  emission standards.   \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(4).  This approach is also pragmatic:  it allows EPA to better \ndescribe the sources within the listed category that will be subject to the standards; \nand until standards are developed, listing of a category has no actual effect on its sources.  See supra note 37.  In the  2002 proposal preamble , EPA explained that it was \nreplacing the clay products source category with two categories, including the clay ceramics manufacturing category.  67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/2 -3.  EPA requested \ncomment on the listing and the sources covered by the listing.  Id.  at 47,896/3.  After \npublication of the 2002 proposal , TCNA could not credibly claim that its members \nhad no notice of the listing and no opportunity to comment on it.  In fact, tile companies commented  that EPA \u201cshould delist ceramic tile roller kilns from the final \n[standards].\u201d   Comments on  Proposed Rule Submitted for American Marazzi Tile and \nMonarch Ceramic Tile at 32 (C omment  4) (Sept. 19, 2002), A -2000-48 , IV-D-07, \n                                                 \n38 Although TCNA asserts these claims under the APA, these claims can only be \nconsidere d, if at all, under CAA section 7607.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(1).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 112 of 135\n-98- \n JA209; 2003 Clay Rule RTC at 2-38, JA 214.  Therefore EPA has satisfied any notice \nand comment requirements for the listing.  \nX. EPA reasonably set the dioxin/furan standards and adequately \nresponded to public comment.  \nIn the Clay Rule, EPA issued numeric dioxin/furan MACT emission limits for \nall new and existing ceramic tile roller kilns, sanitaryware tunnel kilns, floor tile press \ndryers, and ceramic tile spray dryers.  80 Fed. Reg . at 65,478 /3, T able 5.  TCNA \nargues that the dioxin/furan standards are not based on \u201cemissions information\u201d \nbecause EPA requested that sources use a flawed test method to report emissions.  Industry Br. 48 -50.  Additionally, TCNA argues that EPA did not comply with notice \nand comment procedures and that the standards were not a logical outgrowth of the proposal.  Id. at 51.  These arguments lack merit.  EPA prov ided su fficient support for \nthe test method.  Additionally, TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the use \nof the test method, and EPA responded to TCNA\u2019s comments.   \nA. EPA reasonably determined that Method 23 provided emissions \ninformation that could be u sed in determining MACT floors for \nceramic tile sources.  \nBecause each tile industry subcategory contained less than 30 sources, EPA \ndetermin ed the MACT floors based on the lowest-emitting 5 sources for which EPA \nhad emissions information.   See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(B).  In gathering information USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 113 of 135\n-99- \n for the standards, EPA requested that sources use EPA Test Method 2339 to report \ndioxin/furan emissions. See, e.g., 2010 Section 114 Information Collection Request to \nDal-Tile Corp. , Enclosure 3 at 1 -3 (Table 1.1) (Mar. 9, 2010), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290- 0023, JA218- 220.  EPA used the information submitted in response to \ndetermin e the dioxin/furan MACT floors for the tile industry.  See Clay MACT Floor \nMemo  at 2, 8 -12, JA336, 342-346. \nTCNA argues that Method 23 is outdated and does not account for naturally -\noccurring non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials used by the \ntile industry.  Industry Br. 49.  For this reason, TCNA argues that Method 23 \nerroneously reports n on-gaseous dioxin/furan as emissions, and therefore the data \nproduced by Method 23 are not \u201cemissions information.\u201d  TCNA asserts that EPA \nignored this problem and unlawfully relied on the Method 23 data.  Id.   These \narguments fail.40  \n                                                 \n39 Method 23 is a specific sampling method used to determine emissions of dioxin and \nfuran.

Industry Br. 50 .  But b ecause EPA set the \nstandards at MACT floor level s, EPA could not have made those standards less \nstringent.  See Nat\u2019l Lime, 233 F.3d at 640 (holding that the CAA \u201cdoes not provide \nfor exceptions from emissions standards based on de minimis  principles where a \nMACT floor exists\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).

See \nIndustry Br. 48; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 74 12(d)(3).  Here, EPA reasonably considered the results \nof Method 23 tests to provide \u201cemissions informa tion.\u201d  See Clay Rule RTC at 1 2-19, \nJA390-397 (explaining Method 23\u2019s validity and appropriateness in generating \nemissions information on dioxin/furan for ceramic tile sources).41  EPA reviewed the \ndata submitted by the tile industry and determined that \u201cth e recovery of labeled dioxin \nand furan congeners met method requirements\u201d and that the samples generated valid data.  Clay Rule RTC at 12, JA 390.  And although implementation of Method 23 \nvaried, EPA found that the quality control inherent in the method su pported the \nvalidity and accuracy of the results.  Id.  at 12, 16, 18 , JA390, 394, 396.  For several \ncategories with sources similar to those in the tile industry, EPA had found that \nMethod 23 produced \u201cvalid data for particle bound and gaseous chlorinated dioxin.\u201d  \nId. at 16.  Furthermore, the fact that EPA is working to revise  Method 23, Industry \nBr. 49- 50, does not invalidate the data collected using the method.  See Clay Rule RTC \nat 15, JA 393.  EPA specifically determined that the method produced useful emissions \ninformation for ceramic tile sources, and TCNA \u201cfailed to demonstrate that EPA\u2019s [method] \u2018bears no rational relationship to the reality it purports to represent. \u2019\u201d Cement \n                                                 \n41 Cont rary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 48, EPA is not required to make an \nexplicit finding in the rulemaking docket that test data or other sources of information \nEPA considers are \u201cemissions information.\u201d   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 115 of 135\n-101-  \n Kiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (quoting Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. v. EPA , 139 F.3 d 914, 923 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998)).  EPA\u2019s decision to use Method 23 data to determin e the MACT \nfloors was within the agency\u2019s area of expertise and is entitled to deference.  See Cement \nKiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (noting that the Court will \u201cdefer to an agency\u2019s dec ision to \nproceed on the basis of imperfect scientific information, rather than to invest \nresources to conduct the perfect study,\u201d and finding reasonable EPA\u2019s interpretation \nthat \u201cemissions information\u201d in section 7412(d)(3) included compliance data gather ed \nunder another statute  (quoting Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 662) (internal quotation  marks  \nomitted)).   \nB. EPA provided notice and adequately responded to comments \nregarding the dioxin/furan standards.  \nEPA provided sufficient opportunity for TCNA to comment on EPA\u2019s use of \nMethod 23, and EPA was not required to describe in the proposal its justification  for \nusing Method 23.  See  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3) (requiring a statement of the basis and \npurpose of a proposed rule, including a summary of the factual data and  methodology \nused).  Indeed, as demonstrated by its comments, TCNA had the opportunity to \ncomment on the use of the method, including its concern that the method was unjustified.  As required, EPA responded to those comments and provided \njustification for using Method 23.  Clay Rule RTC at 11-19, JA 389-397.  \nFurther, EPA considered and rejected TCNA\u2019s arguments against using \nMethod 23.  EPA explained that \u201cthe quality control inherent in the method provides USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 116 of 135\n-102-  \n adequate support for the validity and accuracy of the emission results.\u201d  Clay Rule \nRTC at 12, JA 390.  In responding to TCNA\u2019s concern that Method 23 does not \naccount for non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials, EPA explained that it had no basis to conclude (and TCNA did not provide any) that TCNA\u2019s concern was warranted.  Id.   Method 23 had been successfully implemented \nto measure dioxin/furan from other source categories, and EPA noted that the same requirements for evaluating the validity of the data still applied.  Id. at 12, 16, JA390, \n394.  EPA reviewed the Method 23 data submitted by tile industry sources and found they \u201cmet method requirements\u201d and \u201cgenerated valid data on emission concentration.\u201d  Id. at 12, JA 390; see id. at 16 -18, JA 394-396 (describing validation \nmethodology  for data collected from tile industry sources). \nIn characterizing EPA\u2019s response to TCNA\u2019s comments in the preamble as \u201ca \nsix-sentence non -responsive brush-off,\u201d Industry Br. 51, TCNA overlooks (1) EPA\u2019s \nmore thorough responses to TCNA\u2019s comments in its r esponse -to-comments \ndocument, see Clay Rule RTC at 1 2-19, JA 390-397; and (2) the fact that the cited \nstatements in the preamble, 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,511/1, are actually in response to different \ncomments .  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,471/1 (noting availab ility of  EPA\u2019s responses to \ncomments in a separate document in the docket).  And with respect to TCNA\u2019s \nargument that EPA\u2019s final rule was not a logical outgrowth of the proposal, see Industry Br. 51, EPA did not change its position:  EPA proposed to and did use \nMethod 23.  Thus, the question of logical outgrowth does not even arise here.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 117 of 135\n-103-  \n XI. EPA\u2019s decision not to set standards for periods of malfunction is \nreasonable and entitled to deference.  \nTCNA argues that EPA arbitrarily and capriciously failed to set standards for \nperiods of malfunction.  Industry Br. 52.  Because EPA did not use emissions data \nfrom periods of malfunction in setting standards, TCNA argues that EPA unlawfully \nset standards that EPA knew the regulated community had not and could not achieve.  \nId. at 53.  TCNA is wrong and ignores clear precedent that is contrary to its position.  \nThis Court recently recognized that because the best- controlled similar source \nis unlikely to be a malfunctioning source, the CAA, if anything, \u201cprevents [  ] EPA \nfrom takin g into account the effect of potential malfunctions when setting MACT \nemission standards\u201d and \u201c[a]t the very least\u201d \u201cpermits [  ] EPA to ignore malfunctions \nin its standard -setting and account for them instead through its regulatory discretion.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  TCNA seeks to \ndistinguish the standards at issue here from the boiler standards at issue in U.S. Sugar  \nby arguing that, in this case, the docket contained information from a single facility \nduring som e malfunction events.  Industry Br. 52.  TCNA cites data from times when \nemission control devices were shut down, resulting in higher than normal emission levels.  See Dal Italia Responses to EPA 2010 Information Collection Request Startup \nand Shutdown Events  (Sept. 22, 2010) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0290-0028, Enclosure 1 \n(\u201cDal Italia Responses\u201d), JA 238-241.  Although some portions of the data were from \nmalfunctions of control  devices, EPA reasonably did not use those data to set USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 118 of 135\n-104-  \n standards.  EPA\u2019s rationale here is essentially the same as the rationale upheld in U.S. \nSugar .  Compare 830 F.3d at 606-09 (noting that EPA based its position on \u201cthe \nimpracticality of accounting for events that are necessarily unpredictable\u201d and that \nEPA explained that it would use its enforcement discretion to determine when \nemission exceedances were excusable) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3-83/2 (explaining \nthe impracticability of accounting for malf unctions in setting standards and asserting \nEPA would use its enforcement discretion).  As this Court has acknowledged, \u201c[w]hile the existence of malfunctions is entirely predictable, the nature of those malfunctions is not, and it is the malfunction\u2019s nature that affects emissions and thus is relevant to the application of emission limits.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And the Court \nupheld EPA\u2019s decision not to set alternative standards to cover malfunctions because \nthe decision to set those standards is purely within EPA\u2019s discretion and any such \nstandard applicable to malfunctions \u201cis likely to be hopelessly generic to govern such \na wide array of circumstances.\u201d  I d. at 608.  Here as well, EPA reasonably declined to \nconsider malfunction data in setting the standards.  See  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3 \n(explaining that \u201caccounting for malfunctions in setting emission standards would be difficult , if not impossible\u201d).  Further, EPA adequately explained why it did not rely \non malfunction data.  Id.  at 65,482/3-8 3/2; Clay Rule RTC at 73 -74, JA 406-407.\n42   \n                                                 \n42 EPA disagrees with TCNA\u2019s assertion that it \u201ck nows from data in the docket that \nthe regulated community has not and cannot achieve [the] standards.\u201d  Industry  Br. \n53.  Because malfunctions are unpredictable, there is no way of knowing when they USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 119 of 135\n-105-  \n TCNA also argues that EPA should have identified legal defenses in the \nregulation s.  Industry Br. 54.   To the extent TCNA seeks to have EPA write \naffirmative defenses into the regulations to protect sources that e xceed  standards due \nto malfunctions , this Court\u2019s past decisions clearly bar EPA from doing so.  NRDC  v. \nEPA , 749 F.3d at 1057 ; U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And, to the extent TCNA seeks \nto have EPA simply list defenses without adopting them or otherwise changing their \navailability, doing so  would neither affect  a defense\u2019s availability  nor change a court \u2019s \nrole to determine what, if any, defenses are properly con sidered in determin ing \npenalties.  NRDC  v. EPA, 749 F.3d at 1063.  In any event, EPA\u2019s statement that a \nsource \u201ccan raise any and all defenses,\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,483/2, simply states the \nlaw, and does not require or empower EPA to specify what defenses c ould possibly \nbe asserted.   \nXII. The mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile sources do \nnot require the use of activated carbon injection controls.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that the mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile \nkilns, spray dryers, an d tile dryers unlawfully require installation of activated carbon \ninjection controls is based on numerous flawed premises.  See Industry Br. 55 -56.  \nFirst, TCNA incorrectly suggests that the standards require use of a particular control \ntechnology.  Simila r to the brick standards discussed supra in Section VI, EPA set the \n                                                 \nwill occur or what their  effect on emissions will be.  EP A therefore reasonably set the \nstandards based on emissions information demonstrating what sources have achieved.  \nSee U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 120 of 135\n-106-  \n standards for the tile industry in the form of numeric emission limits, at the MACT \nfloor levels.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,478 /2-3, Table 5.  Such standards do not require \nthe use of any pa rticular control technology, but instead allow for flexibility in the \nmethod sources use to comply.  Clay Rule RTC at 10 4, 10 5, JA 409, 410 (noting that \n\u201c[i]ndustry may use whatever means and methods they deem necessary to achieve \ncompliance with the emissi on limits\u201d).  And because the standards were set at the \nMACT floor level, they are based on emissions from the best-performing sources.  See \nid. at 103, JA 408.  The cost of using controls was not (nor could it have been) a \nconsideration in determin ing the MACT floor.  I d.; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d); NRDC v. \nEPA , 489 F.3d 1364, 1376 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[C]ost is not a factor that EPA may \npermissibly consider in setting a MACT floor.\u201d).   \nSecond, contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA was not required to conduct a \nbeyon d-the-floor analysis to prove that activated carbon injection controls would be \neffective for tile industry  sources.  See NRDC v. EPA, 489 F. 3d at 1376 (\u201c[The \npetitioner] relies on an incorrect premise that the MACT level of emissions reduction is invalid if it is based on control technology that a source cannot install.\u201d).  Although  \nin response to comments, EPA explained that activated carbon injection controls \nwould be appropriate for controlling mercury and dioxin/furan emissions for sources in the  tile industry, Clay Rule RTC at 104, JA 409, this was not a consideration in \nsetting the standard s and therefore would not be a valid basis for vacating the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 121 of 135\n-107-  \n standards even if EPA had failed to support its reasoning.43  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d); \nNRDC  v. EPA, 489 F .3d at 1376.  \nFinally, TCNA\u2019s argument that the cost of using activated carbon injection  \ncontrols  would be unconscionable, see Industry Br. 56, fails to present a legitimate \nlegal attack on the standards.  Because EPA set the standards at the MACT floor \nlevel, EPA was prohibited from setting less stringent standards based on costs.  NRDC  v. EPA, 489 F.3d at  1375 -76.\n44  Instead, th e standards must be based on \nemission levels actually achieved in the source category.  TCNA\u2019s challenge to the mercury and dioxin/furan emission standards for ceramic tile sources should \ntherefore be rejected.  \nXIII.  EPA set the standards for sanitaryware source s in compliance with the \nCAA.  \nTo obtain information for determin ing the MACT floor for sanitaryware \nsources, EPA sent information collection requests to manufactures of sanitaryware.  \n                                                 \n43 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA did  conduct a beyond -the-floor analysis and \nconcluded that, for tile in dustry sources, \u201cthe incremental costs of additional control \nabove the MACT floor emission limits are not reasonable relative to the level of \nemission reduction achieved.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,659/3.  Based on this finding, EPA \nproposed setting standards at the MACT floor levels.  Id.  \n \n44 It is only where EPA sets a more stringent \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d standard that it has \nto justify the more stringent standards by considering control types, costs, and other \nfactors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2); NRDC  v.

One source from which EPA requested emi ssions \ninformation had installed controls to comply with the new source MACT standards \nfrom the 2003 Rule.  See id. at 65,510/1.

When EPA requested information from Kiln 10, it \nrequested that information be gathered while the controls were operating.

Id.  Additionally, Kohler argues that the standards are inconsistent with \nEPA\u2019s stated objective that emission standards should reflect real -world performance.  \nId. at 62.   These arguments are wrong.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 123 of 135\n-109-  \n A. EPA set the MACT floors as required by the CAA, based on what \nhas been achieved.  \nKohler argues that EPA violated the CAA requirement that MACT floors be \nbased on the actual performance of the best-performing sources by artificially creating \na better -performing source.  Industry Br. 58.  EPA did nothing of the sort.  \nThe CAA requires EPA to set the MACT floors based on the \u201caverage \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources\u201d for which EPA has \nemissions information or could reasonably obtain emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  The CAA does not set a time limit for when the emissions \ninformation that EPA uses in setting the MA CT floor is collected, nor does it specify \ncriteria for what emissions information may be used to show what has been achieved; it simply requires that the emissions limitation has been \u201cachieved.\u201d  See id.

And the data provided to EPA were not \nhypothetical speculation on what Kiln 10 could potentially achieve.

Because info rmation from Kiln 10 demonstrated \nemission  levels actually achieved by the source, EPA permissibly relied on it in \ndetermin ing the MACT floors.46  \nB. EPA was not required to omit emissions data bec ause a source \nachieved emission reductions to comply with a vac ated standard.  \nKohler argues that because Kiln 10\u2019s controls were installed to comply with a \nstandard that was subsequently vacated, EPA should be prohibited from using Kiln \n10\u2019s emissions inf ormation.  Industry Br. 56 -60.  But vacatur of the 2003 Rule does \nnot affect the appropriateness of EPA\u2019s use of the Kiln 10 data.  Although the vacatur invalidated the obligation to comply with the 2003 standards, it did not erase the ability of the source to demonstrate emission  reductions that were actually achieved  in \npractice.

The co-signers\u2019 institutional affiliations are included for identification purposes \nonly and do imply institutional endorsement or support. We appreciate the opportunity to provide  \nwritten comments on EPA\u2019s Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) \n(hereafter referred to as the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation) conducted under the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA),1 which requires EPA to evaluate chemical risks based on the \u201cbest available \nscience.\u201d2 TCEP is a flame retardant chemical that is also used as a plasticizer and in paints and \ncoatings.  \nEPA appropriately determined that TCEP as a whole chemical presents unreasonable risk to \nhuman health and the environment based on high risks of cancer (including some exposures \nexceeding 1-in-1,000 cancer risk) and non-cancer effects to workers, consumers and the general \npopulation from multiple TCEP conditions of use. However, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation \nalso failed to evaluate risks for several conditions of use and relied  on scientific methods and \nassessments that are not consistent with the \u201cbest av ailable science,\u201d3 which can lead to \nunderestimating risk to human and environmental health.   \nEPA continued to rely on a systematic review methodology that is not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA \u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. The National Academies of \nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) recommended the use of exis ting systematic \nreview methods and improved approaches for TSCA risk ev aluations in 2021, and EPA has still \nnot implemented most of these recommendations.\n4 EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on \nChemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) has also recommended best practices in systemati c review to the Agency in \nmultiple reports.5  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is \naligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review \nprotocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.     \nThe TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation also relied on a hazard assessment that violates TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest \navailable science\u201d requirement. While EPA found that neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, \ndevelopmental toxicity, kidney toxicity and cancer  are all likely hazards of TCEP , it failed to \n1 U.S. EPA (2023) .

EXHIBIT E\n    \n 2 provide quantitative estimates of non-cancer risk. We applied methods developed by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) to quantify the non-cancer risk of male reproductive harm from chronic oral TCEP exposure, and found that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of exposures producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40, a risk level 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (1-in-1,000,000). EPA also inappropriately stated that a threshold exists for cancer risk, and did not appropriately use science-based adjustment factors.  EPA also failed to adequately identify and calculate risks posed to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (\u201cPESS\u201d), as required under TSCA.6  Among the populations exposed to high risks from TCEP are breast-fed infants and people who consume fish (fishers in the general population, subsistence fishers and tribal populations), but EPA failed to consider individuals with pre-existing disease, genetic factors, lifestyle factors, or exposures to other chemical and non-chemical stressors that may increase susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposure. A failure to evaluate risk to these groups violates TSCA and results in risk characterization that is not representative of the human population.   EPA also failed to estimate risks for some TCEP conditions of use (for example, cushions in commercial furniture, consumer paints), claiming that it lacked sufficient data and that most of these uses have been discontinued  EPA is obligated under TSCA to estimate risks for all conditions of use that are \u201creasonably foreseen.\u201d7 Since any use that is voluntarily discontinued could resume, they should be considered \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d and EPA should include risk estimates for these uses in the final TCEP risk evaluation. TSCA also requires EPA to consider \u201creasonably available information\u201d when conducting risk evaluations,8 which includes data and information that EPA \u201ccan reasonably generate, obtain, and synthesize for use in risk evaluations.\u201d9 EPA failed to use its authority under TSCA to fill critical data gaps that could result in a more complete assessment of conditions of use. EPA also failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) in time to generate chemical release data to inform exposure assessments in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, which precluded its ability to adequately assess fenceline community exposures and risks.   Finally, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is the first EPA has released since it completed the initial 10 risk evaluations conducted under the amended TSCA in January 2021, and the first to not undergo panel peer review by EPA\u2019s SACC. EPA relied on the SACC to conduct panel peer reviews of the first 10 risk evaluations as well as EPA\u2019s proposed methods for fenceline assessment and systematic review to be used in the forthcoming risk evaluations, and provided EPA with numerous critical recommendations for improvement. For the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA has chosen to conduct a letter peer review, which precludes collaboration and consensus among reviewers and transparency and public participation in the review process, all of which are critical to maintaining scientific integrity and addressing potential financial conflicts of interest among reviewers. SACC panel peer review would also enable the examination of cross-cutting issues that arise in multiple evaluations and the extent to which EPA has addressed previous SACC recommendations, including those made to improve the fenceline  6 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12). 7 15 USC \u00a72602 (4). 8 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(k). 9 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.33 (defining \u201creasonably available information\u201d). \n    \n 3 screening methodology. We therefore urge EPA to conduct a SACC panel peer review for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and all TSCA risk evaluations that are currently in development  Our detailed comments on the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation address the following issues:  1. EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required. a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook. b. EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review. c. Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices. i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the risk evaluation. ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete. iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes. iv. The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  v. EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard and risk assessment. a. EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed. c. EPA failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects. This along with other appropriate factors needs to be added into the assessment.   3. EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.         \n    \n 4 We appreciate the opportunity to provide public input.

EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required.  a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook.   We support EPA\u2019s decision to discard the quantitative scoring method, which was previously used in TSCA systematic reviews and methodology documents to assess study quality and exclude some studies from consideration based on their quantitative scores, despite repeated criticism from peer reviewers and public commenters. EPA originally put forward its approach to systematic review under TSCA in 2018.10  In its review of the 2018 TSCA systematic review method, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) said:  The reliance on numeric quality scores is problematic because scores do not distinguish between high- and low-quality studies, and the relationship between quality scores and an association or effect is inconsistent and unpredictable\u2026More generally, the use of numerical scoring in critical appraisal does not follow standards for the conduct of systematic reviews.11     Do not use numeric scores to evaluate studies.12    In 2021, EPA released its Draft Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Systematic Review Protocol (hereafter referred to as the 2021 Draft TSCA Method), asserting that this document addressed the NASEM recommendations.  However, the 2021 draft retained a quantitative study scoring method.  The review of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method by EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) reiterated the earlier NASEM recommendation:  EPA should follow NASEM recommendations and best practices of systematic review by removing its approach to determine an overall quality score based on the combination of quantitative ratings of each individual data quality evaluation metric, which is essentially a quantitative scoring approach.13  Since completion of the SACC review of the 2021 method, EPA has not issued an updated systematic review methodology.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and its systematic review protocol provide the first indication of how EPA will proceed in conducting TSCA systematic review.  According to the risk evaluation and the protocol, EPA has now taken an important step by discarding the previous quantitative study scoring approach:   10 U.S. EPA (2018).

EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review.   The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation retains certain study quality evaluation metrics that are not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA\u2019s requirement for EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d16 when conducting risk evaluations and make decisions based on the \u201cweight of the scientific evidence.\u201d17 EPA\u2019s approach to study quality evaluation typically applies a set of metrics that assessors must evaluate for each relevant study during systematic review. The TCEP systematic review protocol states that the study quality metrics in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method were retained for the TCEP risk evaluation without revision (with the exception of minor edits to one toxicology metric).18  In applying the 2021 metrics, EPA inappropriately applied metrics to evaluate study quality based on statistical power and statistical significance, disregarding recommendations by the NASEM.  In The Use of Systematic Review in EP A's Toxic Substances Control Act Risk Evaluations, the NASEM stated that:   Many markers of a high-quality study (e.g., whether a study\u2019s investigator has performed a sample size calculation and whether the study is reported adequately or has received appropriate ethical approvals) are unlikely to have any direct implication for the potential for a study to be affected by bias.19  Statistical power and statistical significance are not markers of risk of bias or quality. Statistical significance is not a measure of association or strength of association and should not be used to evaluate studies. In fact, combining multiple  14 U.S. EPA (2023).

The Use of Systematic Review in EPA\u2019s Toxic Substances Control Act Risk Evaluations, p. 35. \n    \n 7 small, low-powered but similar studies in a synthesis is one of the potential benefits of systematic review.20 (emphasis added)  Despite these very explicit NASEM statements about the inappropriateness of these metrics being included in the study quality evaluations; EPA continues to use \u201cStatistical power (sensitivity)\u201d as a study quality metric.21 EPA must discontinue the use of these metrics in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation systematic review and for all risk evaluations that are currently in development.   c. Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices.  i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Along with TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA released a Systematic Review Protocol for the Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) as a supplemental file.  This is the first time EPA has released a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for a TSCA systematic review, which is consistent with best available scientific methods in systematic review and responds to recommendation of the NASEM and the SACC.    However, for future TSCA risk evaluations, EPA must publish a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for public comment first in the process of conducting each risk evaluation (well in advance of completing the draft risk evaluation), which is also consistent with best practices for systematic review.22,23  EPA\u2019s TSCA program should follow the established procedures of EPA\u2019s IRIS program, which makes a draft protocol for each assessment publicly available in advance of its release for public comment. Following the public comment process, the IRIS program then publishes an updated protocol, as needed. For example, for the IRIS assessments of five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d), a draft protocol was made available for public comment for 45 days. The IRIS program then followed up with a revised protocol to address public comments, with documentation of the changes, that was published before the release of the PFAS draft assessments.24  EPA should be following this same approach for all TSCA risk evaluations.   ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete.  The application of systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation includes elements that are not included in the TCEP systematic review protocol.  For example, EPA\u2019s TCEP systematic review protocol continues to require an overall study quality rating. EPA says that it is no longer  20 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2021).

The draft risk evaluation\u2019s description of the approach to human health hazard assessment includes:  EPA considered studies that received low, medium, or high overall quality determinations for hazard identification, evidence integration, and dose-response analysis\u2026Information from studies of uninformative quality were only discussed on a case-by-case basis for hazard identification and evidence integration and were not considered for dose-response analysis. For example, if an uninformative study identified a significantly different outcome compared with high- or medium-quality studies and the uninformative rating was not expected to influence the specific results being discussed, EPA considered the uninformative study for the hazard outcome being considered.25  (emphasis added)  The systematic review protocol, however, does not state that the overall quality ratings that may be selected for a study are high, medium, low, or uninformative, nor does it state how ratings of the many individual study metrics are combined to determine an overall rating.  The study quality term \u201cuninformative\u201d does not appear anywhere in the protocol. This indicates that the TSCA Draft Risk Evaluation is inappropriately applying methods that are not stated in the systematic review protocol.  To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should not derive an overall study rating, and instead implement the domain-based approach of the Navigation Guide.26  However, if EPA continues to develop overall study ratings, the method for doing so must be stated in systematic review protocols prior to their application.   In addition, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation acknowledges that studies rated as uninformative may provide useful information (for example, in the quotation above); therefore, EPA should not use the term \u201cuninformative\u201d to describe relevant studies.    The TCEP systematic review protocol also fails to present a PECO statement for identifying relevant health hazard studies. A PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) statement provides criteria used to decide which studies are relevant to include in a systematic review and is a critical element of any systematic review protocol.27,28  EPA instead references the previous draft PECO statement for TCEP included in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.  Other elements of the hazard evidence identification process similarly reference the 2021 document, which is cited repeatedly in Section 5.5 \u201cEnvironmental and Human Health Hazard\u201d of the TCEP protocol. Similarly, as discussed above, the 2021 Draft TSCA Method is referenced for the approach to study quality evaluation. Each chemical-specific protocol should be a stand-alone document that  25 U.S. EPA (2023).

Dividing the methods across multiple documents increases the risk of mistakes and confusion in conducting the risk evaluation, and makes review of the risk evaluation challenging for peer reviewers and the public. As recommended by the SACC,29 EPA should develop a TSCA systematic review handbook that can be cited in future protocols for specific elements that do not vary across risk evaluations, but only a final handbook should be cited in protocols and not the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.    iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes.  As noted above, the TCEP-specific systematic review protocol issued in 2023 references the 2021 Draft TSCA Method concerning the PECO statement used for identification of evidence relevant to assessing TCEP\u2019s human health hazards. The protocol states:  During data screening, EPA followed the process described in Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft Systematic Review Protocol (U.S. EPA, 2021), to conduct TIAB and full-text screening for TCEP literature search results, as guided by the PECO statement. The same PECO statement was used during TIAB and full-text screening for references considered for the evaluation of environmental and human health hazard resulting from exposure to TCEP.30  (emphasis added)   This statement is unclear because Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method presents two different PECO statements:  one to be used for title-abstract screening (Table_Apx H-31) and a different PECO to be used for full text screening Table_Apx H-33). The 2023 TCEP systematic review protocol does not indicate which PECO statement has been used in conducting the TCEP risk evaluation. One important difference between the two versions of the PECO statement is in specifying the outcomes considered relevant. In Table_Apx H-31, outcomes are:  Human: All health outcomes (both cancer and non-cancer)  Animal and Plants: All biological effects (including bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured water and tissue concentrations).   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact effects.31  In Table_Apx H-33, important changes are made to the outcomes (additions are underlined, deletion shown in strikethough):   29 U.S. EPA (2022).

Draft Systematic Review Protocol Supporting TSCA Risk Evaluations for Chemical Substances Version 1.0, Table_Apx H-31. \n    \n 10 Human: All health outcomes (cancer and non-cancer) at the organ level or higher.  Animal and Plants: All apical biological effects (effects measured at the organ level or higher) and bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured media and/or tissue concentrations. Apical endpoints include but are not limited to reproduction, survival, and growth.   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact (irritation and sensitization) effects.  \u2022 Effects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.32    The PECO statement in Table_Apx H-33 incorporates several limitations on health effects studies that are considered by EPA to be relevant for hazard identification. For human studies, this second PECO statement specifies that only studies \u201cat the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. For animal studies, the second PECO statement specifies that only \u201capical\u201d effects \u201cmeasured at the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. The \u201cscreener note\u201d for this PECO deletes \u201ccellular\u201d from the list of relevant measurable biological effects and indicates that \u201cEffects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.\u201d33  EPA says in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation that the same PECO was used for title-abstract and full-text screening, but it never states which version of the PECO was used.  If EPA used the second version of the PECO (Table_Apx H-33) in conducting the risk evaluation, this would be contrary to the clear advice of the SACC, which said:   EPA should not limit PECO/RESO statements to apical endpoints but consider expanding outcomes to include known upstream markers of effect such as biochemical markers of effect or other outcomes at the cellular level.34   Public comments on the 2021 Draft TSCA Method also detail the many problems with restricting the included studies to only those with apical outcomes or effects at the organ level or higher.35 Inclusion of the PECO in the TCEP systematic review protocol would have avoided any confusion regarding which version of the PECO was applied. To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should specify which PECO statement was used in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and include that PECO statement in the chemical-specific systematic review protocol.  32 U.S. EPA (2021).

The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  EPA\u2019s use of unclear terminology for evidence synthesis and integration is an additional shortcoming of the TCEP systematic review protocol. The NASEM has recommended the use of the term \u201cevidence synthesis\u201d for assembling the evidence and drawing conclusions from a single evidence stream (e.g. toxicology, epidemiology), and \u201cevidence integration\u201d for the subsequent process of drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams.  The SACC review of EPA\u2019s 2021 Draft TSCA Method document reiterated this recommendation:  The EPA did not follow the recommendation of NASEM to separate evidence synthesis from evidence integration. To quote NASEM: \"Evidence synthesis deals with more homogeneous data within a single stream, and evidence integration deals with more heterogeneous data from multiple streams.\u201d36   The EPA could improve the clarify, transparency, and efficiency of its process by adopting the NASEM recommendation to use \u201csynthesis\u201d for drawing conclusions separately for each evidence stream (i.e., human, animal, and mechanistic evidence) and use \u2018integration\u2019 for drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams in combination \u2013 in context of the risk evaluation process/needs.37  In the TCEP systematic review protocol, however, EPA disregards the advice of both the NASEM and the SACC by continuing to use the term \u201cevidence integration\u201d for both steps.38 This is one more area in which EPA\u2019s approach differs from best practices in systematic review, violating TSCA. In addition, failing to adopt consistent and vetted terminology decreases the clarity of the risk evaluation and creates confusion for peer reviewers and the public regarding the procedures applied to drawing conclusions from a single stream of evidence.   v.  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    EPA has made some improvements in its approach to  systematic review under TSCA, particularly regarding the discontinuation of its quantitative approach to study quality evaluation. However, EPA has not indicated if these improvements, including changes to study quality evaluation, will be applied in all future TSCA risk evaluations.  EPA has instead stated that systematic review methods may vary across TSCA assessments.  In doing so, EPA has failed to  36 U.S. EPA (2022).

To adhere to best practices in systematic review, including those recommended by the NASEM and SACC, EPA should issue a new TSCA systematic review methodology document that states methods to be applied consistently to all TSCA rulemakings, which must include applying only qualitative methods for study quality evaluation.  EPA should also prepare a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for each TSCA risk evaluation it conducts, and these protocols should be complete, stand-alone documents that do not refer to the 2021 Draft TSCA Method for critical elements, such as PECO statements and methods for study quality evaluation.  The chemical-specific protocols for ongoing and future risk evaluations should also be released for public comment well before the draft risk evaluations are completed to allow for public input, scrutiny, and opportunities for improvement. We urge EPA to consistently adopt the practices of the IRIS program for systematic review protocol development and publication across all EPA programs and offices.     2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard assessment.  a.  EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation continues to rely on the scientifically-deficient methods for non-cancer dose-response analysis and risk characterization employed in previous TSCA risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s methods for non-cancer risk evaluation do not provide a quantitative estimate of risk. Instead, they rely on calculation of a margin of exposure (\u201cMOE\u201d), defined as:  Margin of Exposure = Non-cancer point of departure / Human exposure.39  The MOE approach is a scientifically inappropriate approach for characterizing risk and is inconsistent with amended TSCA\u2019s requirements to use the \u201cbest available science\u201d and to ensure protection of \u201cpotentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations\u201d (\u201cPESS\u201d).40 Use of the MOE, which relies on a point of departure (\u201cPOD\u201d) with no extrapolation to lower doses, is a simplistic approach that only examines the ratio of the POD to the exposure level and determines whether this ratio \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d or if \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d41 The MOE does not estimate the proportion of the exposed population projected to experience a specified health endpoint or the number of individuals affected, and it perpetuates the scientifically flawed notion that a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cno risk\u201d level of  39 U.S. EPA (2023).

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 13 chemical exposure can be identified for a diverse exposed population.42,43 The National Academies44 and the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d)45 have outlined more robust methods for risk estimation that more accurately account for variability and vulnerability across the human population and have been demonstrated in published case studies.46,47,48,49   We applied the WHO methodology to estimate risks of adverse effects from chronic inhalation and oral exposure to TCEP using EPA\u2019s identification of hazards and estimation of points of departure (PODs).  Specifically, we estimated risks of male reproductive effects (decreased numbers of seminiferous tubules), using EPA\u2019s POD of 2.73 mg/kg-d for oral exposure and 14.9 mg/m3 for inhalation exposure.50  The PODs are drawn from a 35-day study in mice.  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characterization (i.e. selection of a \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d) included an interspecies adjustment factor and a human variability adjustment factor, but inappropriately omitted an adjustment factor accounting for the subchronic duration of the mouse study.  Our application of the WHO methodology includes an adjustment for study duration along with the interspecies and human variability adjustments.   In applying the WHO methodology (see Technical Appendix for details) to risks of adverse male reproductive effects from oral exposure to TCEP, we found that: \u2022 0.06 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 1% of the population, \u2022 0.02 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.1% of the population, \u2022 0.008 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for oral exposure to TCEP uses 2.73 mg/kg-d as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.51 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d52 for any chronic exposure less than 2.73 mg/kg-d / 30 = 0.09 mg/kg-d. By applying the WHO methodology, we found that the upper bound risk at an exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. This risk level is  42 Woodruff, T. J., Rayasam, S. D. G., Axelrad, D.

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 14 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (see below).  Following EPA\u2019s approach for extrapolating from oral exposures to inhalation exposures, the above values can be expressed as inhalation exposures in mg/m3 by multiplying by 5.44.53  For example, the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population is 0.008 x 5.44 = 0.04 mg/m3.  EPA must incorporate this approach to non-cancer dose-response and risk characterization in the final TCEP risk evaluation.  Our analysis demonstrated that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of any exposures less than those producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40,  a risk level that is unacceptably high, even by EPA\u2019s own standards;  EPA typically applies a target range of protection for carcinogenic risks of 1-in-10,000 (10-4) to 1-in-1,000,000 (10-6).54 To offer the strongest public health protections, EPA should target any upper bound risks of non-cancer effects from TCEP exposure to be no more than 1-in-1,000,000 risk level. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed.  EPA has appropriately modeled cancer dose-response as a linear relationship with no threshold, consistent with EPA\u2019s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment for a carcinogen without an identified mode of action (MOA).  However, EPA  incorrectly states  that because TCEP does not act through a known mutagenic MOA, there is a threshold below which there is no cancer risk:  Because direct mutagenicity is not likely to be the predominant MOA, using linear low dose extrapolation is a health conservative analysis that would overpredict risks assuming that TCEP acts via a threshold MOA.55 (emphasis added)  Assuming all TCEP exposure is associated with some risk is likely to be health conservative because EPA does not believe that a mutagenic MOA is likely for TCEP and a threshold below which cancer does not occur is expected to exist. However, information is lacking with which to determine an appropriate threshold.56 (emphasis added)  EPA provides no evidence to support its speculation that there is a threshold for TCEP\u2019s cancer risk.  The absence of a known mutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other MOAs can operate with no threshold.  Further, the NASEM states that human variability, exposure to other chemicals, and background disease processes alone can result in linear dose-response relationships at low doses, regardless of whether mutagenic MOAs are known:   53 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 54 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. 55 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 291. 56 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 334 (repeated on page 418). \n    \n 15 Background exposures and underlying disease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population doses of concern.57  The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for mechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose-response relationship can be linear at a low dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to background processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a baseline level of dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the background process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That may be difficult to measure because of background noise in the system but may be addressed through dose-response modeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic cancer mechanism can result in linear dose-response relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, nonlinear dose-response processes\u2014for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor surveillance, DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles\u2014may be found to cause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background processes, given cancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures and high variability in human susceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low-dose linear dose-response relationships in the human population.58  To adhere to best practices in risk characterization, EPA must remove the statements quoted above regarding a cancer threshold for TCEP from the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation before it is finalized.    c. EPA incorrectly failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects.  EPA omitted critical uncertainty factors (UFs) when characterizing non-cancer risk in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, violating TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. To estimate the non-cancer risks of TCEP, EPA used data from a 35-day mouse study (Chen et al. 2015)59 to derive a POD for male reproductive effects (decreased number of and degeneration of seminiferous tubules), and employed the \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d bright-line approach to determine whether a chronic exposure is sufficiently below the POD.  To calculate the benchmark MOE for risk characterization using the Chen et al. POD, EPA applied an interspecies uncertainty factor (UF) of 3 to account for uncertainties related to any animal-to-human differences remaining after calculation of a human equivalent concentration, and an intraspecies UF of 10 to account for uncertainties around human variability, for an overall UF of 30 (10 x 3).  Thus, according to EPA, any exposure less than 30-fold lower than the POD \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d and for exposures more than 30-fold lower \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d60   57 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 8. 58 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, pp. 129-130. 59 Chen, G; Jin, Y; Wu, Y; Liu, L; Fu, Z. (2015). Exposure of male mice to two kinds of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) induced oxidative stress and endocrine disruption. Environ Toxicol Pharmacol 40: 310-318.  60 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 16 The section of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation on determination of the benchmark MOE makes no mention of the subchronic-to-chronic study duration UF that is usually applied to account for the lower dose that may produce the same effect if a chronic study were conducted.  Inclusion of a subchronic UF would increase the benchmark MOE and in turn lower EPA\u2019s bright line for identifying risks of concern by a factor of 3 to 10.  Failure to increase the benchmark MOE applied to the POD for male reproductive effects from Chen et al. with a subchronic UF therefore results in significant underestimation of risk, potentially by up to an order of magnitude.  The risk evaluation acknowledges the uncertainty in using a POD from a subchronic study:  it is uncertain whether the POD would be lower if Chen et al. (2015a) extended the exposure duration.61  Using Chen et al. (2015a) to represent chronic exposure durations adds uncertainty to the risk evaluation. If the specific effect identified by Chen et al. (2015a) were measured in a chronic study in the same species starting in adolescence, the POD could be more sensitive. Therefore, it is possible that risks might be under-predicted.62  However, the risk evaluation lacks any discussion of the possible use of a subchronic UF to address that uncertainty.  As discussed above, EPA must use probabilistic methods, including adjustment for the subchronic study duration, for dose-response assessment and risk characterization of non-cancer effects.    3.  EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.  In the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA identifies the following groups as PESS:  infants exposed through human milk from exposed individuals, children and male adolescents who use consumer articles or are among the exposed general population, subsistence fishers, tribal populations, pregnant women, workers and consumers who experience aggregated or sentinel exposures, fenceline communities who live near facilities that emit TCEP, and firefighters.63  Identification of PESS for each chemical assessed is a critical aspect of conducting risk evaluation under TSCA, and TSCA requires EPA to  determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.64    61 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 283. 62 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 290. 63 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 329. 64 15 USC \u00a72605(b)(4)(A). \n    \n 17 In the final 2017 TSCA Risk Evaluation Framework Rule, EPA defined PESS (using the statutory definition) as:  a group of individuals within the general population identified by the Administrator who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.65   To date, EPA has not employed a consistent or structured approach to identifying PESS in its TSCA risk evaluations, including scope documents for ongoing risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s approach and terminology for identifying PESS varied considerably in the first 10 risk evaluations. Among the inconsistencies were differences in whether health conditions related to a chemical\u2019s hazards were considered and whether fenceline communities were included.66,67 For example, fenceline communities were identified as PESS for hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), but not for 1,4-dioxane, 1-bromopropane (1-BP), or C.I. Pigment Violet 29 (PV-29); children were identified as PESS for 1-BP and HBCD, but not for 1,4-dioxane or PV-29.68 To remedy the problem of inconsistent and incomplete identification of PESS, Rayasam et al. recommended that:  EPA should prepare a comprehensive methodology to identify PESS and quantify their risks consistently within and across the TSCA risk evaluations.69  EPA has not yet proposed such a methodology. The consideration of PESS in Table 5-69 and Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is a useful initial step towards developing a consistent, structured approach to identifying PESS in TSCA risk evaluations. The table gives explicit consideration to each of the following factors that may lead to increased chemical exposures or susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures: lifestage, pre-existing disease, lifestyle activities, occupational and consumer exposures, socio-demographic factors, nutrition, genetics/epigenetics, unique activities, aggregate exposures, and other chemical and non-chemical stressors.  EPA, however, has violated TSCA\u2019s mandate to consider each of the relevant factors in identifying populations groups that \u201cdue to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects.\u201d70  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:   65 U.S. EPA (2017).

The effect of these factors on susceptibility to health effects of TCEP is not known; therefore, EPA is uncertain about the magnitude of any possible increased risk from effects associated with TCEP exposure.71  EPA\u2019s default approach seems to be that a susceptible subgroup will not be identified as PESS when there are not chemical-specific quantitative data on the magnitude of increased susceptibility for a given susceptibility factor.  TSCA does not require chemical-specific quantitative data to identify or evaluate risk to PESS; TSCA simply requires EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d when evaluating risk to PESS. The best available science demonstrates that both intrinsic factors, which include biological traits like age, genetic makeup, and pre-existing health conditions, and extrinsic factors, which include psychosocial stress from experiencing income inequality, violence, racism, healthcare inequity, or food insecurity, can individually or collectively increase susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures.72 EPA should therefore focus first on identifying susceptible subpopulations based on either chemical-specific evidence or the broader literature on intrinsic and extrinsic susceptibility factors, and then, as a separate step, consider how to account for the elevated risks for each group.  The initial identification of PESS, however, should not be contingent on chemical-specific data to quantify risk for a susceptible subgroup.  Once the appropriate groups are identified as PESS, EPA should then consider the availability of chemical -specific data. When such data are absent, the application of generic adjustment factors (beyond the customary 10x factor for human variability) should be applied to ensure that risks to PESS are not underestimated.73  Lifestage. EPA has appropriately identified infants (exposed from human breast milk), children, male adolescents and pregnant women as PESS. However, infants as PESS should not be restricted to human breast milk exposure, as infants are also likely to be exposed to TCEP via ingestion of household dust (e.g. hand to mouth behaviors). In addition, EPA\u2019s risk evaluation understates the magnitude of human breast milk exposures for some infants by assuming a maximum breastfeeding duration of one year. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) indicate that 37.6 percent of infants born in 2020 were breastfeeding at age 12 months, and 17.3 percent were breastfeeding at age 18 months.74  71 U.S. EPA (2023).

Enhanced susceptibility of infants, children, women of reproductive age and people of age 65 years or older is well-established, and these groups should be identified as PESS for each TSCA risk evaluation, regardless of whether there are chemical-specific data to quantify those differences. Further, EPA makes no adjustments to quantify the enhanced risks to the susceptible lifestages. Instead, EPA applies the customary 10x human variability factor, which is routinely applied in EPA risk assessments and is not sufficient to address human variability in response to chemical exposures.75 EPA acknowledges that \u201cThe magnitude of differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics for some individuals may be greater than accounted for by the UFH of 10,\u201d76 but it then continues to apply this insufficient value. The WHO\u2019s International Programme on Chemical Safety (\u201cIPCS\u201d) found that an adjustment factor of approximately 42X is needed to account for the range in human variability in response to chemical exposure when estimating a risk-specific dose intended for a risk of 1% (1-in-100), with larger factors necessary for protection of the population at lower risk levels.77    Pre-existing disease. EPA did not identify any groups as PESS based on pre-existing disease or health conditions. EPA identified neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and kidney toxicity as likely hazards of TCEP, but it disregarded the prevalence in the U.S. population of vulnerabilities to these hazards. For example, the CDC estimates that 14% of U.S. adults have chronic kidney disease; this affects not just older adults, but also 6% of adults ages 18-44 years.78  Given that kidney toxicity is a hazard of TCEP, people with chronic kidney disease should be considered a susceptible subpopulation in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Risk estimation for this group should also incorporate an adjustment factor (in addition to the customary human variability factor) representing the enhanced risk of kidney effects from TCEP exposure. Similarly, population groups with biological susceptibility to the neurotoxic, reproductive and/or developmental effects of TCEP should also be considered PESS, and appropriate adjustments to the estimation of risks of each outcome for these groups should be made.  Individual activities. Subsistence fishers (including tribal populations) are identified as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation based on elevated TCEP exposures. However, no \u201clifestyle\u201d or \u201cindividual\u201d activities are identified for enhanced susceptibility. EPA mentions smoking as a lifestyle factor that could influence susceptibility to chemical exposures, but it failed to identify smokers as PESS because it found no chemical-specific information. Smoking tobacco has numerous biological effects that could enhance susceptibility to the hazards of TCEP, such as adverse effects on the kidney. Smokers should be considered PESS even if there is not direct TCEP-specific evidence. In addition, we recommend using the term \u201cindividual activities\u201d instead of \u201clifestyle activities.\u201d   75 Julia R.

EPA appropriately identified firefighters as an occupational group with elevated TCEP exposures. However, in discussing the relevant evidence, EPA omitted the important 2022 study by Trowbridge et al.79  EPA also failed to consider firefighter exposures in its unreasonable risk determination for TCEP. According to Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, firefighter exposures are classified as \u201cbackground\u201d and \u201cEPA did not identify sources of increased COU or pathway specific exposure for firefighters.\u201d80 However, it is highly likely that elevated firefighter exposures arise from the presence of consumer and commercial products containing TCEP in burning structures, and firefighter exposures should be a consideration in EPA\u2019s unreasonable risk determinations for those products. In addition, EPA failed to consider that workers may be occupationally exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse outcomes with TCEP (e.g. neurological, reproductive and kidney effects).  People who experience occupational exposures to other toxic chemicals that are linked to similar adverse health outcomes as TCEP can have enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of TCEP and should be identified and evaluated as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Geographic factors.  Geographic factors were not included in Table 5-69 of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. However, EPA has considered geographic factors as contributors to PESS in previous assessments and appropriately identified fenceline communities near facilities that emit TCEP as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, so it is unclear why an entry for this factor is omitted from Table 5-69. Although EPA has estimated exposures to fenceline communities, it has not considered the many characteristics that can enhance susceptibility to the effects of TCEP and are common in fenceline communities. In general, people living in fenceline communities are more likely to be people of color and are more likely to experience increased exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors that make them more susceptible to harm, including a broad range of non-chemical stressors like pre-existing disease, racism, and poverty.81 EPA is therefore required under TSCA to account for these enhanced susceptibilities when evaluating risks to fenceline communities.  Socio-demographic factors. The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says \u201cEPA did not evaluate exposure differences between racial groups.\u201d82  At a minimum, EPA should assess the demographic profile of populations living in locations likely to experience elevated exposures (e.g. sites with TCEP in groundwater, sites near facilities producing, using, or disposing of TCEP).  EPA conducted such an analysis for the proposed TSCA risk management rule for trichloroethylene,83 and this approach should be incorporated in all TSCA risk evaluations.  If EPA does not have the data necessary to conduct a robust, accurate, and scientifically-sound environmental justice analysis of chemicals subject to TSCA risk evaluation, it should develop and execute a strategy for obtaining the data and analyzing it.  For example, EPA could use its TSCA authorities to gather information from industry on TCEP manufacturing/processing sites and products containing TCEP. EPA failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release  79 Trowbridge J, Gerona R, McMaster M, Ona K, Clarity C, Bessonneau V , Rudel R, Buren H, Morello-Frosch R (2022).

The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:  EPA did not identify specific evidence that sociodemographic factors influence susceptibility to TCEP although it is known that they can affect susceptibility to disease.84     TSCA requires EPA to account for enhanced susceptibility to chemical exposures in chemical risk evaluations.  EPA must account for socio-demographic factors associated with enhanced susceptibility in its identification of PESS and in analyzing risks to those groups.  For example, people experiencing poverty or racial discrimination may experience psychosocial stress85,86,87,88,89 that can enhance susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Nutrition. EPA correctly states that \u201cNutrition can affect susceptibility to disease generally,\u201d but it did not identify any PESS because it \u201cdid not identify specific evidence that nutritional factors influence susceptibility to TCEP.\u201d90  People with food insecurity or lack of access to nutritious food can experience enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals, including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Genetics.  EPA states that \u201cgenetic disorders may increase susceptibility to male reproductive effects; this was addressed through a 10\u00d7 UF for human variability.\u201d91  EPA assumes that a 10-fold factor is sufficient to account for human variability in response to chemical exposures, including the impacts of genetics and all the other susceptibility factors in the table, even though the National Academies92 and the WHO93 have both compiled evidence that a larger factor is necessary to ensure public health protection. EPA must accordingly increase the uncertainty factor it uses to account for enhanced susceptibility to TCEP based on genetic disorders.  Aggregate exposures. EPA has only partially accounted for aggregate exposure in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. EPA aggregated across exposure pathways for consumers and separately for workers, but it did not aggregate exposures for workers who also experience consumer and general population exposures, and did not aggregate exposures for consumers who have  84 U.S. EPA (2023).

EPA says that these exposures were not aggregated because it did not have data indicating such co-exposures. EPA should not require chemical-specific evidence to conduct aggregate exposure evidence. It can reasonably model scenarios in which exposures are combined across products and across worker, consumer and general population exposures. For example, some individuals with occupational exposure to TCEP are likely to live close to where they work and would therefore also be exposed as members of the general population.  Other chemical and non-chemical stressors. EPA\u2019s approach to consideration of other stressors in identifying PESS and accounting for risks to PESS is too narrow. EPA mentions experimental findings of benzo-a-pyrene interactions with TCEP, but does not specifically identify persons with exposure to benzo-a-pyrene as PESS and makes no effort to account for the elevated risks arising from those exposures. Further, EPA does not give any consideration to other chemical stressors that share common adverse outcomes with TCEP.  For example, the draft risk evaluation identifies \u201cdifferences in numbers and degeneration of seminiferous tubules\u201d as the \u201cMost Critical Endpoint\u201d among TCEP non-cancer effects.94 EPA\u2019s 2023 draft document on application of cumulative risk assessment to phthalates under TSCA discusses the extensive experimental evidence of seminiferous tubule atrophy/degeneration from phthalate exposure and finds that it is \u201ca sensitive, adverse effect frequently reported by board certified pathologists.\u201d95     EPA should consider males who experienced prenatal exposure to phthalates as a PESS for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation to recognize that pre-existing damage to the seminiferous tubules that may have occurred from phthalate exposure would make males more vulnerable to further harm from TCEP exposure. The consequence of early-life phthalate exposure would be that the risks of male reproductive harm would occur at lower TCEP doses than EPA has estimated in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and an adjustment factor should be incorporated to account for that increased vulnerability to damage of the seminiferous tubules. In addition, TCEP and phthalates can be used together in polyvinyl chloride,96 further supporting the joint consideration of TCEP and phthalates under TSCA. Direct experimental evidence of joint action of phthalates and TCEP is not necessary; the joint action can be inferred from the evidence of a common adverse outcome. Populations exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse effects with TCEP should similarly be identified as PESS.    EPA should expand its identification of PESS based on the factors described above and should expand on the approach of Table 5-69 and Appendix D to develop a comprehensive, consistent, and structured methodology for identifying PESS in all TSCA risk evaluations.         94 U.S. EPA (2023).

For risk characteriza?on of non-cancer health e\ufb00ects, the TSCA risk evalua?on calculates a \u201cmargin of exposure\u201d (MOE) for each exposure scenario, which is the ra?o of the point of departure (POD) to the exposure level.  For the TCEP male reproduc?ve e\ufb00ects, the TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on concludes that an MOE of 30 or more indicates that \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d97  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characteriza?on does not actually es?mate risks of adverse e\ufb00ects in the popula?on with chronic exposure to TCEP, but instead simply applies a \u201cbright line\u201d judgment of whether or not the MOE is adequate.  A more informa?ve approach for both risk characteriza?on and risk management would be to apply the probabilis?c dose-response assessment methods of the Interna?onal Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS),98 part of the World Health Organiza?on (WHO), to es?mate the risk of adverse e\ufb00ects at various levels of exposure.  The IPCS methodology has previously been described and applied in several peer-reviewed journal ar?cles.99,100,101,102,103    We applied the IPCS approach for \u201cquantal-determinis?c\u201d endpoints and the \u201capproximate probabilis?c\u201d calcula?on (see IPCS report Fig 3.5, panel C)104 to es?mate risks of reduced numbers of seminiferous tubules from chronic oral and inhala?on exposure to TCEP .  The analysis involved the following steps: 1. Derivation of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments 2. Application of study duration adjustments 3. Application of interspecies adjustments 4. Application of intraspecies adjustments 5. Calculation of HDMI - the human dose (HD) of TCEP associated with a particular magnitude of effect M at a particular population incidence I.   For each aspect of the analysis, including the values used to derive the IPCS POD and the adjustment factors applied to derive the HDMI, the IPCS methodology uses a 50th percen?le value (P50) as a central es?mate and the ra?o of 95th percen?le to 50th percen?le (P95/P50) as a measure of uncertainty.  All POD and HDMI values presented in this analysis are for con?nuous exposures.  We demonstrate each of these steps star?ng with the EPA oral exposure POD to derive a set of oral HDMI values for di\ufb00erent levels of popula?on incidence, then discuss deriva?on of a corresponding set of inhala?on exposure HDMI values.    97 U.S. EPA (2023).

Guidance document on evaluating and expressing uncertainty in hazard characterization, 2nd edition. \n    \n 24  STEP 1:  Deriva?on of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments  The IPCS methodology requires the use of an ED50 (median e\ufb00ec?ve dose) value as the POD for quantal-determinis?c endpoints.  Since an ED50 is not available from the EPA risk evalua?on, we began with EPA\u2019s benchmark dose, lower con\ufb01dence limit (BMDL) and applied adjustments provided by the IPCS methodology.  At the same ?me, we incorporated quan?ta?ve uncertain?es for each of these adjustments.  EPA used a benchmark response (BMR) of 5% to derive the BMDL for decreased numbers of  seminiferous tubules from TCEP exposure.  The chronic oral non-cancer BMDL05 value expressed as a human equivalent dose (HED) is 2.73 mg/kg-d.105      The \ufb01rst POD adjustment in the IPCS methodology is to convert the BMDL05 to a BMD05 as follows:  BMD05(HED) = BMDL05(HED) x (BMD05 / BMDL05)  This adjustment is used because the Dra) TCEP Risk Evalua1on does not report the BMD05 as an HED.  However, both the BMD05 and BMDL05 are available in terms of the animal dosage, before deriva?on of the HED, and can be used for computa?on of the BMD05 / BMDL05 ra?o.  The necessary values for this ra?o were obtained from EPA\u2019s supplemental \ufb01le of BMD modeling results,106 and the ra?o calculated as follows:    BMD05 / BMDL05 = 28.8 / 20.8 = 1.38  The BMD05(HED) is then:  BMD05(HED) = 2.73 mg/kg-d x 1.38 = 3.77 mg/kg-d  In the IPCS methodology, uncertainty in the BMD is represented by the P95/P50 ra?o, which is equal to the same ra?o of BMD / BMDL, or 1.38.    The second POD adjustment is to convert from the BMD to an ED50.  The ED50 and its uncertainty are determined by applying the following conversion from Chiu et al. 2018:  \u201cif ED50 not reported: BMD at the reported BMR is mul?plied by an addi?onal factor of 3.0; addi?onal uncertainty through adding 1.52 to (P95/P50)2.\u201d107  The median (P50) es?mate of the ED50 is then derived by mul?plying the BMDL05(HED) by the two adjustment factors (P50).  The uncertainty adjustments (P95/P50) for each POD aspect are combined into a composite P95/P50 value.  In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template, those values are entered as follows:    105 U.S. EPA (2023).

Since the determination of the EPA BMDL05 values incorporate dosimetric adjustments, no further adjustment for body size is necessary (P50 = 1).  The uncertainty in the bodyweight scaling is not quantified in this analysis (P95/P50 = 1).    For the TK/TD di\ufb00erences remaining afer bodyweight scaling, the IPCS report recommends a central es?mate (P50) of 1 (i.e., no addi?onal interspecies di\ufb00erences) and represen?ng uncertainty with a P95/P50 factor of 3.112  We incorporated these IPCS recommenda?ons, which are entered In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template as follows:  Interspecies adjustments (AFInterspecies) for probabilisDc  dose-response analysis of chronic TCEP exposure Aspect P50 P95/P50 AFInterspecies-BS 1 1 AFInterspecies-TK/TD 1 3  Step 4:  Applica?on of intraspecies (human variability) adjustments   In the IPCS methodology, the value of the human variability adjustment factor (AFintraspecies) varies depending on the incidence of the adverse e\ufb00ect in the exposed popula?on \u2013 with a larger adjustment factor necessary to extrapolate from the POD to lower levels of incidence.  The IPCS report provides AFintraspecies for several incidence (I) values.

The corresponding values for inhala?on exposure can be derived in two ways, which each provide the same results: 1. Multiply oral HDMI values by a factor of 5.44 mg/m3 per mg/kg-d.  This factor is obtained from information provided in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.113 2. Replace EPA\u2019s oral BMDL05 (2.73 mg/kg-d) in the above tables with EPA\u2019s inhalation BMDL05 (14.9 mg/m3) and recalculate the ED50 and the HDMI values using the same adjustments.   The National Academies and the WHO/IPCS have both recommended using the lower confidence limit (LCL) on a probabilistic dose-response distribution for use in decision-making, in place of a traditional reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC). The National Academies said in Science and Decisions that:  multiple risk-specific doses could be provided\u2026in the various risk characterizations that EPA produces to aid environmental decision-making.114    113 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 114 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 140. \n    \n 34 A Risk-Specific Reference Dose: For quantal effects, the RfD can be defined to be the dose that corresponds to a particular risk specified to be de minimis (for example, 1 in 100,000) at a defined confidence level (for example, 95%) for the toxicity end point of concern.115  The WHO/IPCS said:   the LCL of the HDMI can be used as a probabilis?c RfD to replace the determinis?c RfD. In this case, the probabilis?c RfD is the dose that protects the popula?on from a speci\ufb01ed magnitude and incidence of e\ufb00ect with a pre-speci\ufb01ed per cent coverage (con\ufb01dence).116  Consistent with the guidance from the Na?onal Academies and the IPCS, we summarize the above results in the following table of the lower con\ufb01dence limit (5th percen?le or P05) risk-speci\ufb01c doses (HDMI) for mul?ple levels of risk (incidence or I), for both oral and inhala?on exposures.

Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 140. 116 World Health Organization, International Programme on Chemical Safety (2017). Guidance document on evaluating and expressing uncertainty in hazard characterization, 2nd edition, p. 12. \n    \n 35 \u2022 0.02 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose and 0.10 mg/m3 is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.1% of the population. \u2022 0.008 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose and 0.04 mg/m3 is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for oral exposure to TCEP uses 2.73 mg/kg-d as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.117 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d118 for any chronic oral exposure less than 2.73 mg/kg-d / 30 = 0.09 mg/kg-d. Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an oral exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for inhalation exposure to TCEP uses 14.9 mg/m3 as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.119 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d120 for any chronic inhalation exposure less than 14.9 mg/m3 / 30 = 0.50 mg/m3. Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an inhalation exposure of 0.50 mg/m3 is 2.5%, or 1-in-40.  The es?mates of HDMI presented here were based en?rely on input values and equa?ons available from the WHO/IPCS methodology document and from EPA\u2019s TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on.  An important caveat to these calcula?ons is that the values used to represent human variability may be understated.  The IPCS default human variability distribu?on is based on 37 data sets for human toxicokine?c variability and 34 data sets for human toxicodynamic variability.   Most of these data sets were obtained from controlled human exposure studies of pharmaceu?cals conducted in small samples of healthy adults, represen?ng considerably less variability than found in the general popula?on.121,122,123 If human variability is underes?mated, then the actual dose associated with each incidence level (e.g. I =1%, I = 0.1%) will be lower than the values obtained from this analysis \u2013 or in other words, risk at each dose will be underes?mated.       \n 117 U.S. EPA (2023).

When materials containing TCEP are disposed \nof or recycled, TCEP\u2014and sometimes other high ly toxic byproducts\u2014are released from waste \nincinerators, recycling fa cilities, and landfills and can leach out of recycled-content products.   \nTSCA requires EPA to comprehensively evalua te TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks, including \nrisks to subpopulations who expe rience greater risk than the ge neral population because they \nhave greater exposures or are more  susceptible to harm from TCEP.2  Where, as here, EPA finds \nunreasonable risk, it must regulate the chemical \u201ct o the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents such risk.\u201d3 The draft risk evaluation, while co rrectly finding that TCEP presents \nunreasonable risk to human health and the environment, fails to consider the full ex tent of those \nrisks and deprives EPA of the information it need s to ensure the protection of public health and \nthe environment. \n1 EPA, EPA-740-D-23-002, Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris (2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP)   \n(Dec. 2023) (\u201cDraft TCEP Risk Evaluation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n12/tcep_draft_risk_evalua tion_20231207_hero_pub lic-release.pdf.  \n2 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A) (requiring EPA to evalua te chemicals\u2019 risks to  \u201cpotentially exposed \nor susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d); id. \u00a7 2602(12) (defining \u201cpotential ly exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d). \n3 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). EXHIBIT F\n2 First, despite EPA\u2019s mandate to conduct ri sk evaluations using the \u201cbest available \nscience,\u201d4 EPA disregards the broad scientific consensus that flame retardants like TCEP should \nbe evaluated and regulated as a class, as expr essly authorized by TSCA . While other agencies, \nstates, and scientific bodies ar e actively pursuing that recommended class-based approach, EPA \nevaluates TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks in isol ation, understating the ch emical\u2019s real-world \nimpacts and inviting the substitution of one  toxic flame retardant for another.   \nSecond, EPA unlawfully excludes multiple conditions of use from its TCEP risk \ndetermination, claiming that it lacks the info rmation needed to evaluate them. But TSCA \nrequires EPA to assess the risks a ssociated with all of a chemical\u2019s conditions of use and to \ncollect or generate the information it needs to do so. Here, not only has EPA failed to use \nTSCA\u2019s information collection auth orities to fill asserted data gaps, it also denied a petition \nseeking additional testing of TCEP  by asserting that such testi ng was not necessary and that EPA \ncould evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks adequately using existing data and models . Most problematically, \nEPA fails to use reasonably available informatio n to calculate the full risks from TCEP disposal, \none of the chemical\u2019s most sign ificant conditions of use.   \nThird, for the conditions of use that it does consider, EPA repeated ly understates TCEP\u2019s \nexposures and risks. EPA relies on unsupported assu mptions about exposure  rates and durations, \nignores the impact of background exposures to TCEP, improperly discounts the studies that \ndemonstrate the greatest hazards, and disreg ards its own guidance concerning the use of \nuncertainty factors. Compounding those flaws, EPA violates TS CA\u2019s mandate to evaluate \nTCEP\u2019s risks to potentially e xposed or susceptible subpopulat ions, including people who are \nexposed to TCEP from multiple conditions of us e and exposure pathways and routes, or who are \nmore susceptible to harm because of their exposures to multiple flame retardants that can \nexacerbate the risks from TCEP. EPA also undere stimates risks to tr ibal populations who \nexperience increased TCEP exposures not only fro m the consumption of contaminated fish but \nalso from other subsistence foods and from heig htened exposure associ ated with inadequate \nwaste management infrastructure  and open burning of solid wast e, among other pathways. EPA \nsubstantially understates TC EP\u2019s risks to wildlife and fails to consider the chemical\u2019s effects on \nthreatened and endangered species and other sp ecies of special conser vation concern. Finally, \nEPA relies on vague and underprotective unreasonable risk thresholds that  would leave workers, \nconsumers, and fenceline communities exposed to unacceptable harm.   \nWe acknowledge and appreciate the work that went into EPA\u2019s draft risk evaluation, \nwhich does improve on prior risk ev aluations in several respects. EPA correctly identifies tribal \npopulations as a potentially expos ed or susceptible subpopulati on, recognizes the increased \nexposures and risks tribal popula tions often face from fish consumption, and calculates those \ndietary exposures using bot h contemporary and heritage tribal fish consumption rates. EPA also \nconsiders aggregate risks to certain populations  who are exposed from multiple exposure routes, \na legally required analysis that EPA has negl ected in the past. But EPA cannot adequately \nevaluate the risks associat ed with TCEP, or protect the people who are exposed to it, if it persists \nin ignoring 30 percent of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e and systematically un derstates the risks from \n4 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n3 the other 70 percent. TSCA require s EPA to evaluate the risks fro m all of TCEP\u2019s conditions of \nuse, to all potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations, so EPA has the information it needs \nto fully eliminate TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. We urge EPA to revise its risk evaluation, as set \nforth in greater detail below, so it compli es with those statut ory requirements.   \nI. EPA Cannot Meaningfully Evaluate or Su ccessfully Regulate Individual Flame\nRetardants in Isolation\nOrganohalogen flame retardants (\u201cOFRs\u201d), in cluding TCEP, are added to furniture and\ntextiles, furniture foam and vehicle cushioning, building and construction materials, and a broad \nrange of other products.5 Because they are \u201cmixed into but not chemically bonded to materials, \n[they] can leach out of products\u201d and into people, wildlife, and the environment.6 Ninety-seven \npercent of people in the Unite d States have at least one flame retardant in their blood,7 and 75 \npercent of people tested in one study had a TCEP metabolite in their urine.8   \nPeople are routinely exposed to, and harm ed by, combinations of OFRs in their \nworkplaces, homes, and communities. Multiple fl ame retardants, including TCEP, have been \ndetected in household dust,9 college dormitories,10 daycare centers and nurseries,11 and a range of \nwildlife species.12 Multiple OFRs, including TCEP, are also associated with an increased risk of \ncancer, reproductive harm, and othe r overlapping health effects.13 Evaluating the individual \n5 See, e.g.,  Joseph A.

In the 1970s and 1980s, polyc hlorinated biphenyls \n(\u201cPCBs\u201d) and polybrominated biphenyls (\u201cPBBs\u201d) were widely used as flame retardants until \nthey were found to cause cancer and other severe environmental and health impacts.15 The \nregulation of PCB and PBB flame retardants resulted in the in creased use of polybrominated \ndiphenyl ethers (\u201cPBDEs\u201d), which were later fo und to cause reproductive , developmental, and \nneurodevelopmental harm.16 Even within the PBDE subcla ss, chemical manufacturers often \nresponded to regulation of a particular chemic al by making minor chan ges to its underlying \nchemistry and replacing it with a closel y related, similarly toxic substitute.17 As phaseouts of \nPBDEs began in the 1990s, industry turned to harmful organophosphate ester flame retardants \nlike TCEP, tripentyl phosphate (\u201cTPP\u201d), a nd tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (\u201cTDBPP\u201d).18  \nEven now, as production of TCEP has decrease d in recent years, other organophosphate ester \nflame retardants like 2-Propanol, 1-chloro-,  2,2\u2019,2\u2019\u2019-phosphate (\u201cTCPP\u201d) and 2-Propanol, 1,3-\ndichloro-, phosphate (3:1) (\u201cTDCPP\u201d ) have emerged as replacements.19 As the United Nations \n \nConsumer Product Safety Commission (Sept. 14, 2014), \nhttps://greenscience policy.org/docs/eastmond-cpsc- supporting-materials-14-09-15.pdf .  \n14 See infra Point VI.B. \n15 Barbara Hales & Shirra Freeman, Nat\u2019l Collaborating Ctr. for Env\u2019t Health, Regrettable \nReplacements: The Case of Chemical Flame Retardants  (July 8, 2020), \nhttps://ncceh.ca/resources/evidence-briefs/reg rettable-replacements -case-chemical-flame-\nretardants . \n16 Id.; Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (\u201cATSDR\u201d), Toxicological Profile for \nPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs)  11\u201326 (Mar. 2017) (\u201cTox Profile for PBDEs\u201d), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp207.pdf . \n17 Martin Sharkey et al., Phasing-Out of Legacy Brominated Flame Retardants: The UNEP \nStockholm Convention and Other Legislative Action Worldwide , 144 Env\u2019t Int\u2019l 106041, at *3 \n(2020) (\u201cPenta- and Octa- BDE commercial mixtures were liste d in the Stockholm Convention \nin 2004, while Deca-BDE\u2014used as a replacem ent for Penta-/Octa-BDEs in several \napplications\u2014was listed much later, in 2019.\u201d). \n18 Arlene Blum et al., Organophosphate Ester Flame Retardan ts: Are They a Regrettable \nSubstitution for Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers? , 6 Env\u2019t Sci. & Tech Letters 638, 639 (2019). \n19 See EPA, EPA-740-R1-5001, TSCA Work Plan Chemical Pr oblem Formulation and Initial \nAssessment: Chlorinated Phosphate Ester Cluster Flame Retardants  at 11 (Aug. 2015) (\u201cTSCA \nProblem Formulation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-\n09/documents/cpe_fr_clus ter_problem_formulation.pdf  (\u201c[A]lthough commercial uses of TCEP \nas a flame retardant were declining . . .

The National Academies \nhave found that a class-based approach would \u201cmake regulatory hazard and risk assessment \nmuch more efficient\u201d and \u201cbegin to . . . addres s[]\u201d the \u201cproblem of re grettable substitution,\u201d \nmaking it \u201cthe only possible practic al approach for a set of che micals as large as the OFRs.\u201d30 A \nclass-based risk evaluation would also facilitate the considerati on of cumulative risk, as the \nNational Academies and EPA\u2019s Science Advi sory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) have \nconsistently called for.31 Recognizing the benefits of a multiple-chemical assessment, in 2014 \nEPA commenced a TSCA risk assessment for TCEP along with two st ructurally similar \nphosphate ester flame retardants that were \u201cincreasing[ly used] as substitutes for TCEP.\u201d32 And \nEPA and other governmental aut horities have long evaluated other organohalogen chemicals\u2014\nsuch as PCBs, organophosphate pesticides (\u201cOPs\u201d ), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances \n(\u201cPFAS\u201d)\u2014by class because of their sh ared toxicity and persistence. \nThere is no legal or scientific basis for EPA to reject this \u201cmovement toward a class \napproach\u201d and to evaluate the ri sks posed by TCEP in isolation.33 In addition to violating TSCA\u2019s \n\u201cbest available science\u201d requirement, EPA\u2019s propos ed approach is a poor use of the Agency\u2019s \nlimited resources. EPA should not spend years on the evaluation and management of TCEP\u2019s \nrisks only to see TCEP replaced by TCPP, TDCPP, and other toxic flame retardants that EPA has \nnot targeted for TSCA regulation. To fully acc ount for TCEP\u2019s risks and minimize the likelihood \nof regrettable substitutions, we urge EPA to: (1 ) evaluate the cumulative risks from exposures to \nTCEP and other flame retardants, as set forth in greater detail below,34 and (2) pursue a class-\nbased evaluation of OFRs or identified OFR subclasses, which include k nown TCEP substitutes. \n26 See List of State or Local La ws Banning Organohalogen Flame Retardants in Upholstered \nFurniture (Sept. 22, 2022) (attached as Exhibit A ). \n27 ATSDR, Toxicological Profile for P hosphate Ester Flame Retardants  (Sept. 2012), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp202.pdf . \n28 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(c). \n29 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n30 NASEM OFRs Approach at 4, 6.  \n31 See infra Point VI.B . \n32 TSCA Problem Formulation at 11.  \n33 NASEM OFRs Approach at 6. \n34 See infra Point VI.B.  \n7 II. EPA Appropriately Found That TCEP Pres ents Unreasonable Risk to Human\nHealth and the Environment\nThe draft risk evaluation appropriately concludes that \u201cTCEP presents unreasonable risks\nto human health and the environment.\u201d35 While EPA overlooks and underestimates many of \nTCEP\u2019s risks, its finding that  TCEP presents unreasonable risk  is well supported by the record. \nTCEP is associated with an increased risk  of cancer, neurological  harm, and reproductive \nharm, as well as other serious health and environmental effects.36 According to EPA\u2019s own \nestimates, nearly every occ upational condition of use presen ts unreasonable cancer risks, \nincluding risks as high as 6.9-in-100 from worker s\u2019 dermal exposure to TCEP in paints and \ncoatings alone.37 Inhalation of TCEP from roofing insu lation presents a 4.5-in-100 cancer risk, \nmore than 40,000 times higher than EPA\u2019s standard 1-in-1,000,000 unreasonable risk \nbenchmark.38 TCEP has been widely used in car seats, nursing pillows, and baby toys, and EPA \ncalculated reproductive risks fr om infants\u2019 mouthing of TCEP -containing blocks that are 30 \ntimes worse than the Agency\u2019s accepted benchmark level.39 TCEP presents particularly severe \nrisks to tribal communities, including a greater than 1-in -10 cancer risk from  the consumption of \nTCEP-contaminated fish alone.40 Finally, EPA also calculated un reasonable risks to aquatic life \nfrom multiple uses of TCEP, some of which we re up to 30 times greate r than EPA\u2019s benchmark \nRisk Quotient (\u201cRQ\u201d) of 1.0.41 \nWhile those calculations fail to capture the full extent of TCEP\u2019s risks, the draft risk \nevaluation does contain several important improvements from EPA\u2019s prior TSCA risk \nevaluations. Among them: \n\uf0b7EPA made a risk determination for TCEP as  a whole chemical, as required by TSCA\u2019s\nmandate \u201cto determine whether a chemical s ubstance presents an unreasonable risk of\ninjury to health or the environment.\u201d42\n\uf0b7EP\nA calculated the aggregate risks to consumers who are exposed to TCEP from multiple\nexposure routes,43 although it failed to consider aggreg ate risks to workers, to the general\npopulation, and to people who were expos ed from multiple conditions of use.44\n\uf0b7EP\nA evaluated TCEP\u2019s risks to fenceline co mmunities, a legally re quired analysis that\nEPA nonetheless excluded from its fi rst ten TSCA risk evaluations.45\n35 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n36 Id. at 250\u201385. \n37 Id. at 302. \n38 Id. at 310. \n39 Id. at 308. \n40 Id. at 321. \n41 Id. at 132. \n4215 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). \n43 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 338\u201340. \n44 See infra Point VI.A . \n45 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 205\u201306. \n8 \uf0b7EPA correctly identified tribal populations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible\nsubpopulation\u201d46 whose risks EPA must specifically consider, acknowledged that tribal\npopulations\u2019 distinctive cultures and lifewa ys give rise to many unique exposure\nscenarios and increased exposures to chemi cals such as TCEP, and calculated exposure\nand risk associated with one such scenario\u2014fish consumption.\nIII. EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate All of TCEP\u2019s Conditions of Use\nA.EPA\u2019s Risk Calculations and Unreasonabl e Risk Determination Exclude Six of\nTCEP\u2019s Twenty Identified Conditions of Use\nWhile the draft risk evaluation identifie s 20 conditions of use for TCEP, EPA only \ndetermines the risks associated  with 14 of them. For the re maining six conditions of use\u2014\ncommercial use of fabric and textile products , commercial use of fo am seating and bedding \nproducts, commercial use of  wood resin composites, commercial use of insulation, consumer use \nof paints and coatings, and di sposal (collectively, the \u201cUna ssessed Conditions of Use\u201d)\u2014EPA \nclaims that it \u201cdoes not have sufficient information to determ ine whether they contribute to \nTCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks.\u201d47 \nEPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the risks associat ed with those conditions of use violates \nmultiple provisions of TSCA. First and foremo st, TSCA section 6(b) requires EPA to \u201cconduct \nrisk evaluations . . . to determin e whether a chemical substance pr esents an unreasonable risk . . . \nunder the conditions of use.\u201d48 It is well established that when the word \u201cthe\u201d precedes a \ncollective or plural noun, such as \u201cconditions of use,\u201d it is equivalent to \u201call.\u201d49 TSCA therefore \nrequires EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d the risks associated w ith a chemical under all of the \u201ccircumstances \n. . . under which a chemical substance is in tended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be \nmanufactured, processed, distributed  in commerce, used, or dispos ed of,\u201d which EPA concedes it \ndid not do for the Unassessed Conditions of Use.50 As EPA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit have both recogni zed, the plain text of TSCA and of EPA\u2019s implementing \nregulations \u201cunambiguously do not  grant EPA the discretion\u201d to exclude conditions  of use from a \n46 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A), (F). \n47 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. In additi on to the Unassessed Conditions of Use, EPA \nfailed to measure the risks associated with ot her conditions of use, such as recycling, but \nnonetheless asserted that those uses would not contribute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. As \ndescribed below, those conclusory determinations also violate TSCA. See infra  Point IV .E. \n48 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). TSCA defines \u201cconditions of use\u201d as \u201cthe circumstances . . . under \nwhich a chemical substance is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, \nprocessed, distributed in commer ce, used, or disposed of.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2602(4). \n49 See, e.g., Dutcher v.

As noted, EPA asserts that \u201cw aste disposal (landfill or \nincineration, [is] covered in each [condition of use/occupational exposure s cenario]\u201d addressed in \nthe risk evaluation, \u201cas opposed to a separate [condition of use].\u201d78 This approach is flawed, first, \nbecause it inherently fails to capture the full extent of disposal-related exposures for people \nworking in disposal facilities and people living near those facilities.  Facilities such as landfills \nand incinerators likely receive TCEP-containing wastes generated through multiple conditions of \nuse. Accordingly, people who work in, or liv e near, a facility processing or holding TCEP-\ncontaining wastes will not  just experience exposure associated with a single use of TCEP. It is \nirrational for EPA to \u201cconsider\u201d disposal-related releases and exposures in  the context of single \nconditions of use as this is not  how relevant populations will actually be exposed. In addition, \nEPA\u2019s approach is flawed because it omits major categories of TCEP disposal, including disposal \nvia wastewater discharges and disposal of imported articles.79 Further, for many of the conditions \n72 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n73 Id. at 47. \n74 See id.  at 22, 147, 175\u201376 (discussing use of TCEP in aerospace equipment and products, \npaints, construction material s, building insulation, matt resses, and furniture).  \n75 Id. at 42. \n76 Id. at 436; see also id.  at 42 (\u201cWhen used as an additive, TCEP is added to manufactured \nmaterials via physical mixing rather than chemical bonding and as a result, TCEP can easily \nleach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d). \n77 Id. at 19, 39, 84. \n78 Id. at 47. \n79 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating limited subset of conditions of use for which associated disposals \nwere assessed). \n13 \n of use for which EPA purported to consider a ssociated disposals, EPA made no attempt to \nquantify disposal-related releases  or exposures and there is no indication of whether or how EPA \nactually incorporated any \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of these re leases and exposures into its risk \ndeterminations.80 \nEPA\u2019s failure to quantify releases of TCEP associated with wastewater discharges is \nespecially concerning. EPA acknowledges that TC EP is widely detected in surface and \ngroundwater samples, is not effe ctively removed by conventional dr inking water or wastewater \ntreatment, and is released into  the environment through wastew ater effluent and landfill \nleachate.81 EPA observes that \u201cTCEP was among the 10 most frequently found compounds in a \nstudy that collected wastewater fro m multiple sites in the Research  Triangle Park area of North \nCarolina between 2002 and 2005,\u201d and that TCEP a nd other flame retardants \u201cwere measured \nprimarily at sites downstream from municipal wastewater discharges.\u201d82 EPA further notes that \n\u201c[l]aundry wastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastew ater treatment plant influent \nand subsequently to the aquatic environment.\u201d83 Yet EPA fails to utilize readily available data to \nestimate the volume of these releases. These data include multiple sampling studies that \nmeasured TCEP concentrations in wastewater  treatment plant discharges in Los Angeles\u2014\nstudies that EPA itself, as well as the Nationa l Marine Fisheries Service (\u201cNMFS\u201d) previously \nutilized to assess risks to wildlife prot ected under the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d).84 In \naddition, the Washington Department of Ecol ogy recently measured high concentrations of \nTCEP in wastewater discharges from aerosp ace/aircraft modificati on, industrial laundry, \nshipbuilding, and food processing facili ties, as well as in  landfill leachate.85  \n \n80 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating that EPA did not quantify releases or  exposures from disposals \nassociated with numerous commercial uses of TCEP); id. at 49 (acknowledging that \u201cthere may \nbe TCEP releases to the environment via the de molition and disposal of consumer articles, as \nwell as to wastewater via domestic laundry,\u201d but claiming that \u201cEPA  did not have enough \ninformation to assess [these] environmental releases quantitatively\u201d); id. at 51\u201352. \n81 Id. at 39, 42, 45. \n82 Id. at 149, 188. \n83 Id. at 75.  \n84 See Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7(a)(2) Biological \nOpinion and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Consultation and Management Act Essential Fish Habitat Response  80 (Mar. 2022), https://repository. library.noaa.gov/view /noaa/37544; EPA \nRegion 9, Biological Evaluation and Esse ntial Fish Habitat Assessm ent for Discharges to the \nPacific Ocean from Outfalls Associated w ith the City of Los Angeles Hyperion Water \nReclamation Plant and Wastew ater Collection Systems  at 7, 21 (Jan. 2023), \nhttps://repository .library.noaa.gov/ view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.38 of PDF); Los Angeles \nSanitation, Hyperion Treatment Plant and Te rminal Island Water Reclamation Plant Special \nStudy Final Report, Constituents of Emerging Concern (CECs) Special Study  at 5, 7\u20138 (Apr. \n2020), https://repository.libr ary.noaa.gov/view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.161 of PDF).  \n85 Siana Wong, Wash.

It is similarly unclear why \nEPA could not quantify releases fr om landfills and incinera tors. As to landfills, EPA claims it is \nimpossible to produce such estima tes \u201c[w]ithout a full characteri zation of non-hazardous landfill \n. . . conditions and historical wastes . . . around the country.\u201d86 But EPA modeled TCEP releases \nfrom landfills,87 and more recent data on organophosphate flame retardants in landfill leachate \nare available and could be combined with the da ta cited in the draft risk evaluation to better \ncharacterize environmental releases  of TCEP in landfill leachate.88 EPA\u2019s assertion that \u201c[s]ource \nattribution of the consumer uses to the leach ing concentration exhibited . . . [in the risk \nevaluation] are not available, \u201d purportedly precluding a dete rmination of whether \u201cthese \nconcentrations are the result of consumer an d/or commercial dispos al,\u201d is irrelevant.89 EPA must \nassess all \u201ccircumstances . . . under which [TCEP]  is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to \nbe . . . disposed of,\u201d90 and in prior risk evalua tions it has characterized disposal as a condition of \nuse, without attempting to allocate dispos al-related exposures between comme rcial and \nconsumer uses.91 Here, too, quantifying the proportion of landfill leaching attributable to \nconsumer versus commercial di sposal is not required.   \nMoreover, for the limited disposal -related releases that EPA did attempt to quantify, it \nutilized loading rates th at substantially understate the quantity of TCEP that is currently in, or \nwill foreseeably be entering, the waste phase. Specifically, EPA calcula ted disposal-related \nreleases based on estimated domestic produc tion volumes of 2,500 pounds  per year or 25,000 \npounds per year.92 Even assuming for the sake of argumen t that those estimates were accurate \nwith respect to current  TCEP production volume, EPA ac knowledges that U.S. production \nvolume for TCEP was nearly 100 per cent greater just ten years ago.93 That figure\u2014which does \n \ndetected V6\u2014a flame retardant that includes TC EP as an impurity\u2014in wa stewater from many of \nthose same source categories. \n86 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 149. \n87 Id. at 84\u201385. \n88 See, e.g. , Trine Eggen et al., Municipal Landfill Leachates: A Significant Source for New and \nEmerging Pollutants , 408 Sci.

Yet EPA\u2019s analysis fails to account for this reality.  \nIt is critical for EPA to char acterize these releases accurately  given, among other factors, \nthe \u201cpotential for TCEP to migrate to groundwater and dom estic wells from nearby non-\nhazardous waste landfills . . . or historic waste sites.\u201d97 Indeed, older landfills holding TCEP-\ncontaining articles are especially likely to leach  TCEP, as they \u201care more  likely to lack the \ninfrastructure of modern landfill s, such as liners, leachate co llection systems, and reactive \nbarriers, which would prevent leachate from entering the groundwater system.\u201d98 In revising the \ndraft risk evaluation, EPA must incorporate accu rate loading rates for TCEP-containing waste \ndisposed via landfilling, incine ration, and wastewater to a void substantially understating \ndisposal-related expos ures and risks. \nEPA also must correct additional flaws in its analysis of TCEP releases from waste \nincineration. First, EPA must eval uate exposure and risk associated with the toxic byproducts that \nresult from incineration of TCEP-c ontaining wastes. In the draft ri sk evaluation, EPA states that \n\u201cthermal treatment and open bur ning are not favorable options  for the disposal of TCEP\u201d \nbecause they generate significan t TCEP releases and also \u201cproduce numerous toxic byproducts, \n \n94 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 22 (\u201cIn the past, TCEP was processed in many products \nmade in the United States, includ ing fabrics and textiles, some types of foam, and construction \nmaterials\u2014some of which may still be in use today.\u201d); William A.

EPA must do so in the final \nrisk evaluation, utilizing waste-volume estimates th at reflect real world conditions. Second, in so \ndoing, EPA must consider the speci fic risks associated with treat ment of TCEP-containing wastes \nin nonhazardous solid waste incine rators versus open burning, as  these approaches will differ \nsubstantially in the extent of TCEP releases and releases of  toxic products of incomplete \ncombustion.

For instance, TCEP is \u201cused as an additi ve plasticiser . . . for polyurethane, polyesters, \npolyvinyl chloride and other polymers.\u201d100 TCEP has also been detected in high-density \npolyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d) water pipes,101 from which it can leach into water supplies and enter the \nenvironment.102 In some products, TCEP is also used \u201cas  a secondary plastici ser . . . to suppress \nthe flammability resulting from plasticisers such as phthalates.\u201d103 \u201cWhen used as an additive, \nTCEP is added to manufactured materials via ph ysical mixing rather th an chemical bonding and \nas a result, TCEP can easily leach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d104   \nThe foregoing plastic uses ar e all \u201ccircumstances . . . unde r which [TCEP] is intended, \nknown, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used, or \ndisposed of,\u201d and must th erefore be considered in the draft risk evaluation.105 But while EPA \nconsiders exposures to TCEP from plastics used  in certain aerospace equipment and children\u2019s \ntoys, it fails to evaluate the ma nufacturing, use, and disposal of  polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d) and \nHDPE pipes and other plastic material s that are known to contain TCEP.106 EPA also ignores the \n \n99 Id. at 437\u201338; see also id.  at 45 (\u201c[T]here is a robust conf idence that TCEP . . . produces \nhazardous byproducts when undergoing thermal degradation . . .\u201d). \n100 Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Biotechnology Info., Nat\u2019l Li br. of Med/, PubChem Annotation Record for \nTRIS(2-CHLOROETHYL) PHOSPHATE \u00a7 8.1, PubChem, https://pubchem.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/compound/8295  (last visited Feb. 6, 2024).  \n101 Tomas Diera et al., A Non-Target Screening Study of High-Density Polyethylene Pipes \nRevealed Rubber Compounds as Main Contaminant  in a Drinking Water Distribution System , \n229 Water Rsch.

It is irrelevant \nwhether TCEP is currently being used to ma ke those products, since TSCA requires EPA to \n \n17 \n presence of TCEP in microplastics that form from the breakdown of larg er plastics containing \nTCEP, or that adsorb and spr ead TCEP in the environment.107 This omission is particularly \nconcerning since studies have found that micr oplastic co-exposures can exacerbate TCEP\u2019s \nneurotoxicity.108 Microplastics containing TCEP can be ingested by fish, other wildlife, and \npeople, resulting in aggregate and cumulative risks that EPA unlawfully failed to address.109 To \nfully evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks \u201cunder the conditions of use,\u201d EPA must assess a broader range of \nplastic uses, as well as the presence of TCEP in microplastics, in its final risk evaluation.110 \nOther reported conditions of use, which are not mentioned in the draft risk evaluation, \ninclude the use of TCEP  in \u201clubricating oil,\u201d111 as \u201can extractant for rare metals,\u201d112 as a \u201cthermal \ncoolant\u201d for metals,113 and in \u201clithium batteries.\u201d114 EPA must look into those uses as well, and \neither include them in the TCEP risk evalua tion or justify its deci sion to exclude them.  \nIV. EPA Underestimates Exposures to TCEP \nA. The Draft Risk Evaluation Is Predicat ed on an Unsupported Assumption Concerning \nTCEP Manufacturing and Import V olumes \nEPA\u2019s calculations of TCEP\u2019s risks to workers, the genera l population, and the \nenvironment are based on an unsupported assump tion concerning the amount of TCEP that is \npresently manufactured or imported. Since EP A has no workplace monitoring or environmental \nrelease data for most of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e, the Agency instead evaluates TCEP exposures \n \nconsider a chemical\u2019s legacy us es as well as its ongoing ones.

Indeed, a 2018 study estimated 1,110 \nkilograms (2,425 pounds) of annual TC EP air emissions in the City of Toronto alone, with a \nhigh-end estimate (95% confidence in terval) of 26,000 kilograms (57,320 pounds)125 With a \nsingle Canadian city estimate d to release nearly 2,500 pounds of  TCEP per year, EPA cannot \njustify calculating national TCEP releas es and exposures based on a 2,500-pound production \nestimate. EPA should instead evaluate risk based on a current production level that is equal to or \ngreater than the CDR repor ting threshold of 25,000 pounds, while also accounting for \nsubstantially higher domestic production and imp ort of TCEP in the recent past.     \n EPA\u2019s reliance on current production levels to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks understates the \nchronic risks to people who were exposed to far greater amounts of  TCEP in earlier life stages.126  \nBetween 1986 and 2002, the CDR-reported produc tion volume for TCEP was between 1,000,000 \nand 10,000,000 pounds, and in 2006 it was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pounds\u2014several \norders of magnitude higher th an EPA\u2019s current 2,500-pound estimate.127 TCEP presents cancer \nand other chronic risks that accru e over a lifetime of exposures , and EPA calculates those risks \nusing a \u201clifetime averag e daily dose\u201d representing the averag e amount of TCEP that someone is \nexposed to each day over the course of their lifetime.128 For the purpose of determining a \nLifetime Average Daily Dose, past exposure levels within a person\u2019s lifespan are just as relevant \nas current ones. As the SACC advised EPA in  its report on the draft risk evaluation for \nperchloroethylene: \n[O]lder data should be used to estimate  prior exposure doses, which can then be \nadded to exposures going forw ard in time. It is unrealis tic to only address [those] \nwho start their exposures today (or within the last 10 years only).

Those older \nexposures are relevant to today\u2019s added risks.129   \nWhile EPA cannot turn back the clock and undo those prior exposures, it must regulate \ncurrent TCEP uses and exposure \u201cto the extent necessary\u201d so that the Lifetime Average Daily \nDose remains below the level a ssociated with unreasonable ris k. Moreover, as described above, \nEPA must consider prior production and import levels when evaluating the risks from TCEP \ndisposal, because much of the TC EP-containing waste that is curren tly being disposed of, or that \nis currently leaching out of landfills, comes from articles and products that  were manufactured or \nimported decades ago.130 By calculating risk using only an estimate of current production \nvolume\u2014which in itself is unjustifiably low\u2014EPA underestimates the chronic risks to workers, \nconsumers, and others who were exposed to much  higher levels of TCEP in earlier decades and \nviolates TSCA\u2019s mandate to appl y the \u201cbest available science.\u201d131  \nB. EPA Understates Infants\u2019 and Children\u2019s Exposures to TCEP \n The draft risk evaluation recognizes that \u201c[i]nfants are a pote ntially susceptible \npopulation because of their higher exposure per body weight, immature metabolic systems, and \nthe potential for chemical toxicants to disrupt sensitive developmental processes, among other \nreasons.\u201d132 Infants are exposed to TCEP from the milk they drink, the toys they play with, the \nmattresses they sleep on, and other sources. In multiple ways, however, EPA understates those \nexposures. \n First, EPA assumes that infants br eastfeed for a maximum of one year, 133 despite \nevidence and public health reco mmendations to the contrary . The American Academy of \nPediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend the contin uation of breastfeeding for at \nleast two years or longer,134 and CDC data show that more th an 17 percent of infants are still \nbreastfed at 18 months of age.135 EPA\u2019s assumption that breastfeeding will end after one year is \n \n129 TSCA Sci.

EPA concedes that \u201c[i]nformation on . . . \nmouthing durations\u201d was \u201climited,\u201d137 and the Exposure Factors Handbook recommends 95th \npercentile mouthing durations rangi ng from 11 minutes per hour (fo r children aged two to three \nyears) to 26 minutes per hour (for ch ildren aged three to six months.)138 EPA claims that its \nmouthing values were taken from EPA\u2019s Consumer  Exposure Model (\u201cCEM\u201d) but it does not say \nhow the model derived those estimates,  whereas the recommendations in the Exposure Factors \nHandbook  are backed by multiple studies of in fants\u2019 and children\u2019s mouthing behaviors.139 EPA \nshould use the 95th percentile mouthing durations from the Exposure Factors Handbook , or any \nhigher estimates in published literature, to calculate TCEP mouthing exposures. \n Third, while EPA separately calculated the risks from infants\u2019 breastfeeding and \nmouthing, it failed to consider  the risks to infants who ar e exposed to TCEP from both \nbreastmilk and the products they mouth, as  well as other exposure pathways.140 Breastfeeding \nand mouthing are both typical in fant behaviors, making it highly likely that a significant number \nof infants will be exposed from bo th pathways. Similarly, when calculating the concentrations of \nTCEP in breastmilk, EPA considered maternal TC EP exposures from individual conditions of use \nin insolation, but failed to cons ider aggregate exposures to la ctating people who are exposed \nfrom multiple conditions of use and thus have gr eater levels of TCEP in  their breastmilk. As \ndescribed in greater detail below,  EPA\u2019s failure to consider those aggregate exposures is contrary \nto TSCA and inconsistent with the best available science.141 \nC. EPA Also Understates Consumer, Worker , and General Population Exposures to \nTCEP \n EPA also understates consumer, worker, a nd general population exposures to TCEP.  \nFirst, EPA underestimates the c oncentrations of TCEP in polyu rethane foam products that are \nused by consumers and workers, including furn iture and automobile cushioning. While TCEP \nhas been detected at concentrations up to 19,800 mg/kg (1.98 percent)  in such foam, EPA \n \n136 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 195. \n137 Id. at 192. \n138 EPA, EPA/600/R-09/052F, Exposure Factors Handbook: 2011 Edition , at 4-3 (Sept. 2011) \n(\u201cExposure Factors Handbook\u201d), https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/e ims/eimscomm.getfile?p_downl oad_id=522996 (recommending \n95\nth percentile mouthing duration values of 11-26 minutes per hour, depending on age). \n139 Compare Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 197, with Exposure Factors Handbook at 4-3, 4-12 \nto 4-14. \n140 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 245. \n141 See infra  Point VI.A. \n22 \n disregards that data and assumes TCEP c oncentrations of less than one percent.142 EPA asserts \nthat the lower values were \u201ct hought to be more current and representative of the U.S. \npopulation,\u201d presumably because the higher conc entrations were taken from a German study \npublished in 2001 (the \u201cIngerowski study\u201d).143 But TCEP and TCEP-containing products are \nimported into the United States , and many older vehicles and products containing TCEP foam \nare either still in use or are being disposed  of. Moreover, EPA relies on the Ingerowski study\u2014\nand other data that predates that study by more than a decade\u2014to calculate other TCEP \nexposures.144 EPA should similarly use that study when calculating TCEP exposures from \npolyurethane foam products. \n EPA also ignores workers\u2019 incidental inges tion of TCEP-containing dust that settles on \ntheir hands and clothing, despite pr eviously \u201cacknowledg[ing] that oral exposures are a potential \nroute for workers and agree[ing]  that hand-to-mouth and inges tion of dust particles can be \nsources of occupational oral exposure.\u201d145 TCEP has been detected in dust samples taken from \nresidential spaces, public spaces, vehicles, and recycling facilities.146 While EPA considered \nconsumers\u2019 ingestion of TCEP-containing dust,  it excludes that e xposure route from its \noccupational risk assessment and thus unde restimates workers\u2019 exposures and risks.147  \n Finally, EPA understates the duration and vol ume of general population exposures to \nTCEP. EPA  falsely assumes that no one will be e xposed to TCEP in the ambient air or surface \nwater for more than 33 years, based on a decades-o ld study of how long most people remained in \na single residence.148 But as the SACC advised EPA in its recent report on th e supplemental 1,4-\ndioxane risk evaluation, the \u201c homeowner mobility value (33 years) \u2026 is inadequate for \n[potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulat ion] communities,\u201d which TSCA expressly \nrequires EPA to consider, and is \u201carguably invalid for the general population as well.\u201d149 EPA\u2019s \nassumption understates the risks to people who rema in the in same reside nce for longer than 33 \nyears, as well as to people who move within a given community but remain exposed to the same \n \n142 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 175. \n143 Id. \n144 Id.

EPA Unlawfully Ignores Most Dietary Exposures to TCEP \nEPA further understates risks to exposed populations by ignoring dietary exposures \nbeyond contaminated fish. According to EPA, \u201c[a]n Australian study indicated that more than 75 \npercent of the estimated daily intake  of TCEP came from dietary ingestion.\u201d152   \nBut EPA excludes the vast majority of t hose dietary exposures from its draft risk \nevaluation, improperly attributi ng them to \u201cnon-TSCA\u201d uses.153 Contrary to EPA\u2019s claim, many \ndietary exposures are subject to  regulation under TSCA and must be evaluated and regulated by \nEPA. While TSCA excludes from the definition of chemical substance \u201cany food,\u201d as defined in \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201c FFDCA\u201d), \u201cwhen manufactured, processed, or \ndistributed in commerce for use as a food,\u201d not  all foods and methods of food production fall \nwithin the scope of that exclusion.154 For instance, just as subsistence fishing does not constitute \nthe \u201cmanufactur[ing], process[ing], or distribu t[ion] in commerce\u201d of an FFDCA-regulated food \nproduct, neither does the cu ltivation of crops, gathering of pl ants, or raising of livestock for \npersonal consumption. Yet the draft risk evaluati on does not evaluate whether TCEP\u2019s conditions \nof use may cause soil, water, or biosolids cont amination that result in  non-excluded dietary \nexposures ( e.g., from personal garden ing and farming.) \nMoreover, even uses that are not regulate d under TSCA still must be considered as \nbackground exposures when evaluating the risk s posed by TCEP.

For example, in its a ssessment and regulation of the \npesticide fumigant sulfuryl fluoride, EPA\u2019s Office  of Pesticide Programs (\u201cOPP\u201d) considered all \nsources of exposure to fluoride,  including ones EPA does not re gulate (such as toothpaste). \nConsidering these exposures was critical for accurate risk calcula tion and decision-making\u2014\nOPP proposed to terminate pesticid al uses of sulfuryl fluoride b ecause children\u2019s total exposure \nto fluoride (mainly from drinking water and toothpaste) exceeded acceptable exposure levels.158 \nEPA\u2019s Office of Water similarly routinely acc ounts for background exposures to contaminants \nwhen establishing drinking water standards by ap plying a default assumption that 80 percent of \ntotal contaminant exposures ar ise from non-water sources, desp ite those exposures falling \noutside of the regulatory purview of the Safe Drinking Water Act.159 Here, too, dietary exposures \ncontribute to TCEP\u2019s total risks and exacerbate  the risks that people experience from TSCA \nregulated uses. EPA must consider those exposures in the final risk evaluation.  \nE.

Indeed, \nthe source EPA cites for the proposition that TCEP is not typically used in  electronics, Stapleton \net al. 2011, concerns detections of TCEP in fo am and does not discuss th e extent to which TCEP \nor any other flame retardan t is used in electronics.163 Contrary to EPA\u2019s characterization, peer-\nreviewed literature analyzing TCEP concentrations in e-waste recycling facilities indicates that \nTCEP releases are strongly associated with e- waste recycling. For exam ple, Gravel et al. 2019 \ndetected TCEP in 100 percent of air samples from Canadian e-waste recycling facilities, \ncompared to 67 percent of control group samples.164 Along with triphenyl phosphate (\u201cTPhP\u201d), \nTCEP was measured at the hi ghest concentrations among all organophosphate esters analyzed \nand was associated with the processing of both older [cathode ray tube] televisions and newer \ntelevisions.165 Nguyen et al. 2019 also detected TCEP a nd other flame retardants in dust and air \nsamples at Canadian e-waste processing f acilities, with TCEP \u201cthe most abundant \n[organophosphate ester flame retardan t] in workbench air samples.\u201d166 Further, Nguyen et al. \n2019 measured higher dust concentr ations at workbenches compared  to a central location within \nthe facility, \u201cconsistent with the release of  contaminated dust during dismantling\u201d of \nelectronics.167  \nMoreover, EPA makes no attempt to characteri ze releases and exposures associated with \nthe recycling of other TCEP-containing material s, including polyurethane  foam, in which EPA \nasserts TCEP \u201cis predominantly found.\u201d168 Polyurethane foam is r ecycled through a variety of \nprocesses,169 including mechanical processes that genera te substantial amounts of dust during the \nchopping or shredding of foam.170 Recycling of polyurethane foam  exposes recycling workers, \ncommunities, and the environment near recycling facilities; carpet installers; and consumers who \npurchase recycled-content products such as \u201crebo nd\u201d carpet padding or upholstered furniture that \ncontains recycled foam. \u201cPost-consumer foam (o ld carpet cushion) now returning for recycling \nmay contain up to 12 percent by weight\u201d of TCEP and other halogenated flame retardants, which \n \n162 Id. at 355, 364. \n163 Heather M.

EPA Underestimates TCEP\u2019s Hazards \nA. EPA Overlooks and Misapplies Ne cessary Uncertainty Factors \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s hazards and risks, EP A disregarded the best available science, \nas well as EPA\u2019s own risk assessment guidance,  concerning the use of uncertainty factors.  \nUncertainty factors are \u201cvery impor tant . . . to determining the sa fety of [chemicals] . . . to \nhumans,\u201d172 since they account for gaps and uncertainti es in the risk assessment process that \ncould otherwise \u201cresult [in] an incomplete char acterization of the chemical\u2019s toxicity\u201d and an \n\u201cunderprotective\u201d risk calculation.173  The use of appropriate uncerta inty factors is necessary to \nconduct risk evaluations \u201cin a manner consis tent with the best available science.\u201d174 In its draft \nrisk evaluation, however, EPA failed to apply tw o critical uncertainty factors and misapplied \nanother.  \nFirst, when calculating TCEP\u2019s chronic repr oductive toxicity, EPA relied on a subchronic \nduration study without applying the recommended \u201csubchronic-to- chronic-duration\u201d uncertainty \nfactor.175 In the draft risk evaluation, EPA explains that it chose \u201ca study with a shorter exposure \nduration\u201d to assess \u201cchronic exposure scenarios because it resulted in a[] [human equivalent \ndose] that is more sensitive . . . than most longer-term results.\u201d176 The problem is not that EPA \nselected the wrong study to calcu late reproductive risks, but ra ther that EPA misapplied the \nresults of that study.

As described above, EPA claims that it la cks sufficient data to evaluate several of \nTCEP\u2019s conditions of use.180 EPA also asserts that \u201cthe currentl y available evidence is inadequate \nto assess whether TCEP may cause endocrine ch anges,\u201d \u201cthyroid change s,\u201d \u201clung or respiratory \neffects in humans,\u201d or \u201cimmunological or hematological effects in humans.\u201d181 Those asserted \ngaps do not excuse EPA from evaluating all of TCEP \u2019s conditions of use and health effects, and \nEPA has an established approach for addressing precisely those so rts of database deficiencies. \n\u201c[T]o account for the potential fo r deriving an underpro tective [risk estimate] as a result of an \nincomplete characterization of th e chemical\u2019s toxicity,\u201d EPA gui dance recommends the use of an \nadditional \u201cdatabase deficiency\u201d uncertainty factor.182 In light of EPA\u2019s own claims of inadequate \ndata, EPA must apply that uncertainty factor here. \n Finally, EPA misapplies the \u201cintraspecies\u201d uncertainty factor, which is intended to \n\u201caccount for variations in susceptib ility\u201d within the general population.183 The intraspecies \nuncertainty factor is designed to  cover the myriad sources of variations within the general \npopulation, not the increased risks faced by disc rete potentially expos ed or susceptible \nsubpopulations.

Instead of calculating the risks to  those subpopulations\u2014s uch as people who are \nmore susceptible to TCEP\u2019s risks because of genetic conditions like Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletion, and myotonic dys trophy\u2014EPA asserts that their increased \nsusceptibility is \u201c[a]ddressed\u201d through the \u201c[u]se of [the] de fault [intraspecies uncertainty \nfactor].\u201d\n186  But that uncertainty factor is intend ed to address unspeci fied variations in \nsusceptibility across the general pop ulation, not the heighted risks f aced by identified potentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulations. Indeed, if a ten-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is \nused to account for general popula tion variation even in the abse nce of a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation,187 the same adjustment plainly cannot account for those who are \nknown to experience increased susceptibility, and EPA offers no evidence that its default \nuncertainty factor would adequately capture the risks to all potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations. When EPA identifies potentiall y exposed or susceptible subpopulations, EPA \nmust calculate their risks separa tely from those of the genera l population, as opposed to relying \non a default uncertainty factor  that\u2014by EPA\u2019s own admission\u2014m ay not be up to the task.188 \nB. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Neurotoxicity Risks \nContrary to typical agency pr actice and the best available science, EPA failed to use the \nmost sensitive study when calculating TCEP\u2019s neurotoxic effects (the \u201cTilson study\u201d). EPA \nacknowledges that the Tilson study was the \u201cmos t sensitive\u201d neurotoxicity study after accounting \nfor uncertainty factors, resulting in risk esti mates that are far greater than those that EPA \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.189 But EPA did not use that study because \u201cthe authors \n \n185 EPA Review of Ref.

In partic ular, the ratio of the benchmark margin of \nexposure (expressed as \u201ctotal UF\u201d)  to the point of departure (expr essed as human equivalent dose \nor HED) is approximately 4.6 for the Tilson stud y and approximately 3.2 for the study selected \nby EPA, indicating that the Tilson study is mo re sensitive and would result in higher risk \ncalculations than those calculated  in the draft risk evaluation. Id. at 276\u201377. \n29 \n tested only a single dose level, which did not allow a full understanding of the dose-response for \nTCEP\u201d and \u201conly a [Lowest Observed Adverse Ef fect Level, or \u201cLOAEL\u201d] was identified,\u201d as \nopposed to a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (\u201cNOAEL\u201d).190   \nNone of those arguments justifies the decisi on to understate TCEP\u2019s neurotoxicity risks. \nWhile the Tilson study did involve only one dos e, nothing precludes EPA from relying on a \nsingle-dose study when it is the most sensitive, and EPA does not  need \u201ca full understanding of \nthe dose-response\u201d in order to establish a point  of departure and calc ulate risks from that \nstudy.191 Indeed, the Tilson study has been favorabl y cited in an analys is conducted for the \nCPSC,192 by Environment Canada and Health Canada,193 and, previously, by EPA itself.194 \nSimilarly, the fact that the Tilson study did not identify a NOA EL does not support disregarding \nthe study. EPA frequently calculate s risks based on LOAELs, using a ten-fold uncertainty factor \nto account for the absence of a NOAEL.195 To capture all of TCEP\u2019s potential risks, it is critical \nthat EPA use the most sensitive study for each endpoint, including the Tilson study for \nneurotoxicity.  \nC. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Cancer Risks \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s cancer risks, EPA re lied exclusively on kidney tumor data even \nthough TCEP exposures have been associat ed with other cancer sites as well.196 In addition to \nkidney cancer, studies have linked TC EP to leukemia and thyroid cancer.197 EPA admits that \n\u201c[u]se of tumor data for only one target organ ( i.e., not combining incidence with other target \norgan tumors) may result in so me underestimation of risk.\u201d198 But EPA made no effort to address \nthat concern by calculating total cancer risks. \nEPA must consider all know n cancer sites in its dose -response analysis and its \ndetermination of whether TCEP presents unrea sonable cancer risks.

EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate TCEP\u2019s Risks to Potentially Exposed or \nSusceptible Subpopulations  \n The draft risk evaluation also violates TSCA\u2019s  mandate to evaluate risks to \u201cpotentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d who, \u201cdue to either greater susc eptibility or greater \nexposure, may be at greater risk than the ge neral population of advers e health effects from \nexposure\u201d to TCEP.201  As set forth below, EPA fails to consider several pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations\u2014including people w ho have \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP from \nmultiple conditions of use or exposure pathways or who have \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to harm \nbecause of their cumulative exposures to other flame retardants and toxi c chemicals in addition \nto TCEP. Additionally, EPA understates the risks to the potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations that it did identify.  \nA. EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Exposures and Risks to People Who Are \nExposed to TCEP From Multiple Conditions of Use and Exposure Pathways \n TSCA requires EPA to evaluate risks to those who are exposed to a chemical from \nmultiple conditions of use or from multiple exposure routes and pathways. First, such \npopulations experience \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater risk\u201d than  the general population because \nof those aggregate exposures, and thus consti tute a \u201cpotentially e xposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d that EPA must evaluate under TSCA section 6(b).202 In addition, TSCA section \n6(a) directs EPA to eliminate the unreasonable risks from \u201cany combination of\u201d a chemical\u2019s \nconditions of use, which is only possible if EPA fi rst evaluates the risks from such combinations \nof exposures and determines whether they are unreasonable.203 Finally, TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available \nscience\u201d mandate compels the considerat ion of aggregate exposures and risks.204 The National \nAcademies have acknowledged the \u201cneed for\u201d risk assessment to  cover \u201caggregate exposure . . . \n \n199 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment  at 1-12 to 1-13; see also EPA, EPA-740-R1-8012, \nRisk Evaluation for Asbestos  Part I: Chrysotile Asbestos  173\u2013175 (Dec. 2020),   \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-\n12/documents/1_risk_evaluation_for_asb estos_part_1_chrysotile_asbestos.pdf  (adding the risks \nassociated with multiple types of cancer associ ated with chrysotile asbestos to determine the \noverall cancer risk).   \n200 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 291. \n201 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n202 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n203 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n204 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n31 \n [from] all routes, pathways, and sour ces of exposure to a given agent,\u201d205 and EPA\u2019s SACC has \nspecifically advised EPA to aggregate exposures  from multiple conditions of use under TSCA.206 \n EPA itself has recognized that \u201cin devel oping a comprehensive risk estimate for a \nchemical substance, it is  the Agency\u2019s responsibility to consid er the aggregation of what may be \nlower individual exposures from individual c onditions of use and routes of exposure.\u201d207 In its \nrecently proposed revisions to the TSCA risk ev aluation rule, EPA states that it \u201cwill consider \naggregate exposures to the chemical substance.\u201d208   \n In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA ignores all aggr egate exposures from \ncombinations of conditions of use and most aggr egate exposures from combinations of exposure \npathways and routes.209 While EPA claims to \u201clack . . . r easonably available data indicating co-\nexposures of multiple TCEP containing activit ies or products in the occupational and indoor \nenvironment,\u201d EPA cannot disregard aggregate ex posures merely because it failed to gather \ninformation on them.210 TSCA requires EPA to evaluate the risks posed by TCEP through the \n\u201ccircumstances . . . under which [the] chemical  substance is intende d, known, or reasonably \nforeseen to be manufactured, processed, distribute d in commerce, used, or disposed of.\u201d211  \nTCEP\u2019s uses are neither rare nor  unforeseen; the chemical has been widely used as a flame \nretardant and plasticizer in hom e insulation, furniture, rugs, and other common products. It is \nthus virtually inevitable, and certainly \u201creasonably  foreseen,\u201d that some of the people whose roof \ncontains TCEP insulation also own a rug or a vehi cle with TCEP as well, and that some of the \npeople who are exposed to TCEP on the job also  have TCEP-containing products and materials \nin their homes.212 EPA must evaluate those reasonably fo reseen combinations of exposures, and \nthe risk evaluation contains all of the inform ation that EPA needs to do so. Since EPA has \ncalculated the exposures from those conditions of use individually, it can add them to calculate \nrisks to the people who are exposed  from reasonably foreseen combin ations of conditions of use. \nAs further support for those aggr egate exposure calculations, EP A should consider studies of \n \n205 Science and Decisions at 266. \n206 TSCA Sci.

First, as described above, EPA has not \nsupported its total produ ction volume estimate of 2,500 pounds per year.214 Second, even if that \nestimate were supported and all pr oduction-related re leases were attributed to a single pathway, \nthe public would still expe rience aggregate exposures that EPA has not accounted for. In addition \nto production-related releases of TCEP, people ar e also exposed to TCEP  from landfill leachate \n(which is the result of historic  as well as ongoing TCEP use), the consumption of contaminated \nfish and wildlife (which does not depend on cu rrent production volumes alone), and from other \nexposure routes and pathways. Rather than \u201cdou ble count[ing]\u201d exposures, the consideration of \nrisks across exposure routes and pathways\u2014ma ny of which are not tied to TCEP\u2019s current \nproduction volume\u2014would more accurately re flect real-world exposures and risks.  \n EPA also claims that when a single exposure pathway or condition of use is sufficient to \nestablish unreasonable risk, the consideration of additional, aggregate exposures is unnecessary.\n215 This argument misunderstands the central purpose of a risk evaluation, which is \nnot only to determine the n eed for risk management ( i.e., whether an unreasonable risk exists) \nbut also to determine the extent of the risk management needed. TSCA requires EPA to regulate \nchemicals \u201cto the extent necessa ry so that [they] no longer pr esent[] [unreasonable] risk.\u201d216 If \nEPA has not considered aggregate exposures to  determine the full extent of a chemical\u2019s \nunreasonable risks, then it will not have the in formation it needs during risk management to \nensure that such risks are eliminated. For in stance, someone may be exposed to unreasonable \ncancer risk from both the ingest ion of TCEP-contaminated fish and the inhalation of TCEP from \ntheir home insulation. According to EPA, there is no need to consider their aggregate exposures \nand risks because either condition of use and exposure pathway alone  is sufficient to support an \n \n213 Id. \n214 See supra  Point IV .A. \n215 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 340 (\u201cThere were  no instances of aggreg ate lifetime risk for \nany [condition of use] where there was not alr eady risk to the [condition of use] from an \nindividual route . . . .

To \nfully address their risks, and to comply with it s TSCA obligations, EPA must evaluate the risks \nfrom known, intended, and reasonably foreseen comb inations of conditions of use, exposure \nroutes, and exposure pathways. \nB. EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Sus ceptibility of People Who Are Exposed to \nTCEP and Other Toxic Chemicals That Contribute to Cumulative Health Risks \n EPA also fails to evaluate as potentially  exposed or susceptib le subpopulations people \nwho experience \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to ha rm from TCEP exposures because of their \ncumulative exposures to multiple ch emicals and non-chem ical stressors.218 Like the failure to \nconsider aggregate exposures, this  omission violates not only TSCA \u2019s mandate to evaluate risks \nto potentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulations but also the requirement to conduct risk \nevaluations using the \u201cb est available science.\u201d219 The National Academies ha ve repeatedly called \nfor the consideration of cumulative exposures in chemical risk eval uations, explaining that \u201cit is \ndifficult to imagine any risk assessment in which it would not be important to understand the \neffects of coexposures to agents or  stressors that have similar [mode s of action] . . . or to identify \ncharacteristics of the affected populations that could contribute to vulnerability to a given \nexposure.\u201d220 More recently, the National Acade mies called on agencies to \u201cmove beyond \nsource-by-source and pollutant-by-pollutant . . . risk assessment a nd toward a fuller \ncharacterization of the cumulative and potential ly synergistic health risks from multiple \nenvironmental and social stress ors that disproportionately imp act communities of color\u201d and \neconomically insecure communities.221 Similarly, the SACC has characterized cumulative \nexposure assessment as \u201ca necessary step \u201d in the TSCA risk evaluation process.222 EPA itself \nadmits that \u201cwithout considering the cumulative risk of chemicals,  the Agency\u2019s risk mitigation \nmay not fully be able to consider the public-h ealth implications of va rious risk management \noptions for reducing exposure.\u201d223 \nYet EPA makes no effort to address cumulative exposures and risks in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, despite available evidence of such risks.

Similarly, studi es have shown cumulative risks \nfrom co-exposures to TCEP and microplastics, which exceed the risks associated with TCEP \nalone.226 EPA did not consider those cumulative ex posures and the resulting increase in \nsusceptibility and risk.   \nNor did EPA evaluate cumulative risks fro m exposures to TCEP and other flame \nretardants. For instance, TCEP is an impurity in the flame-retardant mixture V6, and the two \nflame retardants are frequen tly detected in the same pr oducts and environmental media.227 While \nEPA considered exposures to TCEP from the use of products containing V 6, it never assessed the \ncumulative effects of those flame retardants together. TCEP also  is found alongs ide other flame \nretardants\u2014including PBDEs and other organophos phate ester flame retardants like TCPP and \nTDCPP\u2014in household dust, water, and other environmental media.228 Many of those flame \nretardants are associat ed with the same types of harm as TCEP,229 meaning people who are \nexposed to other flame retardants will be more su sceptible to harm from their TCEP exposures.  \nEPA has acknowledged the cumulative effects fro m other organophosphate chemicals, such as \norganophosphate pesticides.230 Organophosphate ester flame retardan ts are \u201cstructu rally similar\u201d \n \n224 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 333 (\u201c In vitro  data on co-exposure with benzo-a-pyrene \nshowed increased impacts on inflamma tion and proliferation pathways.\u201d). \n225 Youjian Zhang et al., Combined Effect of Tris(2-chlor oethyl)phosphate and Benzo (a) pyrene \non the Release of IL-6 and IL-8 from HepG2 Cells Via the EGFR-ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway , 7 \nRoyal Soc\u2019y Chem.

EPA Understates TCEP Exposures a nd Risks to Tribal Populations \nWe strongly support EPA\u2019s identifi cation of tribal popul ations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u201d  for purposes of the TCEP risk evaluation.232 As reflected in the draft \nrisk evaluation and elaborated below, TSCA\u2019s de finition of \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d indisputably includes tribal populations , who consistently face \u201cgreater risk than \nthe general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or \nmixture\u201d because of both \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater susceptibility.\u201d233 Yet, until now, EPA \nfailed to identify tribal populations as a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation \nrequiring particularized consider ation in risk evaluation and ri sk management. In taking the \ncritical step of identifying tribal populations as a higher- risk subpopulation, EPA correctly \nrecognizes that tribal populations \u2019 \u201cintricate connection to the la nd and . . . distinctive lifeways \nand cultures . . . create many unique exposure scen arios that can expose tr ibal members to higher \ndoses of contaminants in the environment.\u201d234  \nHowever, in the draft risk evaluation for TCEP, EPA failed to follow through on this \ninsight by comprehensively asse ssing the factors that increase tribal popul ations\u2019 exposure to\u2014\nand susceptibility to harm from\u2014TCEP. Indee d, \u201cEPA did not evaluate\u201d the heightened \nexposures associated with \u201cactivities that are uni que to tribal populations\u201d and \u201cquantitatively \nevaluated only the tribal fish ingestion pa thway for TCEP because of data limitations.\u201d235 As EPA \nacknowledges, this approach \u201coverlooks many other unique exposure scenarios\u201d236 and \nultimately understates th e risks TCEP presents to  tribal populations. To sa tisfy TSCA, in the final \nTCEP risk evaluation EPA must utilize all readil y available information to characterize tribal \npopulations\u2019 exposures and susceptibilities, as well as appropriately c onservative assumptions \nand uncertainty factors wh ere data are limited.  \nAmong other factors that increase TCEP e xposures in tribal populations, EPA must \naccount for the impact of solid waste disposal pr actices in tribal comm unities.

Elsewhere in the risk evaluati on, EPA consistently utilizes both \n50th and 95th percentile exposure values to estimate TCEP exposures to th e general population \nand to workers who, like tr ibal populations, experience heightened exposure.246 And there are \nreadily available data reflecting 95th percentile fish ingestion ra tes in tribal populations. For \nexample, Harper et al. 2007 cites a 95th percentile fish ingestion rate of 798 g/day for the \nSuquamish Tribe.247 Second, even if it were appropriate to utilize only me an fish ingestion rates, \nthe value EPA utilized to characterize mean cu rrent/suppressed tribal fi sh consumption rates\u2014\n216 g/day\u2014is too low.

Third, as discussed above, EPA unde restimates environmenta l releases of TCEP \nand resulting concentrations of TCEP in fis h, which leads EPA to further understate TCEP \nexposures from fish consump tion in tribal communities.250 Fourth, although EPA calculated \nTCEP exposures from fish consumption using a high and low bioaccumulation factor (\u201cBAF\u201d) of \n2,198 L/kg and 109 L/kg, respectively,251 EPA only utilized the low BAF \u201cto determine \nunreasonable risk.\u201d252 EPA offers no explanation for disc arding the higher BAF at the risk \ncharacterization stage, which generated si gnificantly less severe risk calculations.253  \nFinally, EPA did not consider aggregate or cu mulative chemical exposur es affecting tribal \npopulations nor account for increase d susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposures among tribal \npopulations due to psychosocial stressors such as poverty, crowded and/ or substandard housing \nconditions, health care ine quity, and discrimination.254 Further, while EPA acknowledged that \ntribal populations\u2019 access to subsistence fish sp ecies is severely constrained, EPA did not \nconsider the effect that reduced  access to fish and other traditi onal foods has on nutrition, health, \n \n246 See, e.g. , Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 170, 221, 232. \n247 Harper et al.

EP A must correct these \ndeficiencies in the final risk ev aluation to accurately characterize exposures and risks in tribal \npopulations and ensure that EPA\u2019s forthcoming ri sk management rule for TCEP will include all \nmeasures that are necessary to  eliminate the unreasonable risk s tribal populations face.   \nD. EPA Fails to Calculate TCEP\u2019s Increased Ri sks to Truck Drivers, Students Residing \nin Dormitories, and Firefighters. \nEPA also overlooks increased TCEP exposures  of several other pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations. \nFirst, TCEP is used in automotive foam, 255 posing increased risks to long-haul truck \ndrivers and others who spend more time in vehi cles than the general population. TCEP is also \nused in mattresses and carpets, with greater  exposures from \u201cextremely worn carpets.\u201d256 Long-\nhaul truck drivers spend far more time inside ve hicles than the general population, and they are \nmore likely to sleep in their vehicle cabs.257   \nBut EPA never considered the in creased risks that truck driv ers\u2014a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u2014expe rience from their \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP.258 Instead, EPA \nsolely evaluates the risks that TCEP in automo tive and furniture foam presents to the general \npublic, who EPA assumes will be exposed for no more than one hour per day and no more than \n73 days per year.259 Those assumptions underestimate risks to the general population (including \npeople who have long, daily commute s in their cars), and are plai nly inapplicable to truckers \nwho can exceed EPA\u2019s annual exposure estimate  in a span of one to two weeks.   \n EPA also fails to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks to firefighters, despite identifying them as a \npotentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulation. EPA acknowledge s that \u201cfirefighters have \nelevated TCEP exposures as a re sult of firefigh ting activities,\u201d 260 including the inhalation of \nTCEP that is aerosolized from products and building materials when they burn.

Using that info rmation, EPA should calculate TCEP \u2019s risks to firefighters.   \nFinally, EPA must consider TCEP\u2019s risks to students in dormitories and other student \nhousing, which are more likely to contain older or  second-hand furniture and less likely to have \nvacuum cleaners that limit the accumulation of dust . High levels of TCEP have been detected in \ndust in student dorms and common areas , with measurements up to 32,000 ng/g.265 TCEP levels \nin one dorm room exceeded Califor nia\u2019s risk-based soil screening standards, indicating potential \nrisk.266 Yet EPA fails to consider that data in the draft risk evaluation, a nd it does not evaluate \nstudents\u2019 increased exposures to and risks from TCEP. \nVII. EPA Has Not Adequately Assessed th e Risks TCEP Poses to Wildlife \nAs EPA acknowledges, it has coequal oblig ations under TSCA to determine whether \nTCEP \u201cpresents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. \u201d267 Yet in multiple \nrespects, EPA\u2019s assessment of the risks TCEP poses to wildlife is incomplete, does not \nconsistently incorporate and reflect the best avai lable science, and violates TSCA. We urge EPA \nto correct the deficiencies outlined below in the final risk evaluation. \nA. EPA Unlawfully Omitted Conditions of Use, Exposure Pathways, and Exposure \nSources from Its Assessment of  Wildlife Exposures to TCEP \nAt the outset, EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s environmental risks does not satisfy TSCA \nbecause EPA failed to determine the environmental risks associated with multiple conditions of \nuse268 and, for many others, provided only a cursor y discussion that dismissed environmental \n \n261 Id. \n262 Id.  \n263 Id. \n264 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a). \n265 Dodson et al.

For exam ple, to justify its failure to determine the \nenvironmental risks associated with TCEP releases from consumer products, EPA asserts that \n\u201c[c]onsumer releases to the environment are antici pated to be less than oc cupational releases, and \nwastewater concentrations from manufacturing, commercial and pr ocessing [conditions of use] \nwere shown to be significantly lower than acu te and chronic [concentrations of concern]\u201d \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.270 It is difficult to underst and how EPA can make this \nclaim about the magnitude of TCEP  releases from consumer products  since it failed to estimate \nthose releases. Indeed, EPA\u2019s observation elsewhere in the draft risk evaluation that \u201c[l]aundry \nwastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastewater treatment plant influent and \nsubsequently to the aquatic envi ronment\u201d appears to contradict the Agency\u2019s justification for \nwriting off consumer product releases.271 Further, even if EPA were  correct that environmental \nreleases from consumer products ar e less than releases from other conditions of use, that would \nnot excuse EPA from fully characterizing and acc ounting for those releases. As discussed above,  \nin the context of assessing human health risk s EPA has recognized that \u201cin developing a \ncomprehensive risk estimate for a chemical s ubstance, it is the Agen cy\u2019s responsibility to \nconsider the aggregation of what  may be lower individual exposu res from individual conditions \nof use and routes of exposure.\u201d272 This conclusion applies equa lly to EPA\u2019s assessments of \nenvironmental risk and underscores that EPA ma y not write off exposures associated with a \nspecific condition of use on the basis that they ma y be less than those asso ciated with another. \nAs EPA recently acknowledged in its proposed amendments to the regulations governing \nTSCA risk evaluations, it also lacks discretion to disregard k nown pathways of TCEP exposure \n \ncondition of use \u201cseparately from the risks already estimated for other relevant [conditions of \nuse]\u201d); id. at 364 (\u201cEPA is unable to determine if dis posal contributes to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable \nrisk.\u201d). \n269 See, e.g., id.  at 147 (explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures to TCEP \nassociated with industrial and commercial use of aerospace equipm ent and products but \n\u201cexpect[s]\u201d these conditions of use \u201cto have lower risk than the qua ntified scenarios\u201d); id. at 148 \n(explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures associated with consumer use \nand disposal of articles cont aining TCEP but stating without support that these releases are \n\u201canticipated to be less than  occupational releases\u201d); id. at 363 (asserting that , for most conditions \nof use, \u201cthe Agency had limited data available an d was not able to fully quantify risks to the \nenvironment\u201d). \n270 Id. at 148. \n271 Id. at 75. \n272 88 Fed.

Similarly, \u201c[d]irect exposure of TCEP to aquatic receptors via \nbiosolids was not asse ssed quantitatively.\u201d275 These omissions violate TSCA, which does not \ngive EPA discretion to write off exposure pa thways that it judges\u2014here, without even \nconducting a complete analysis\u2014contribute relativel y less to overall risk. Further, EPA will not \nbe able to determine what measures are needed  at the risk management stage to eliminate \nTCEP\u2019s environmental risks if it has ignored importan t segments of exposure and risk at the \nevaluation stage. Wildlife exposur e to TCEP via biosolids app lication is undoubtedly important; \nas EPA found, \u201c[d]ue to its persistence, it is li kely that dissolved TCEP will eventually reach \nsurface water via runoff after the land application of biosolids.\u201d276 \nIt also appears that EPA\u2019s an alysis of wildlife ingestion exposure did not consider the \ncontribution of ingested  plastic debris and microplastics.  Many wildlife species, including \nloggerhead sea turtles protected by the ESA,277 are chronically exposed to organophosphate \nflame retardants such as TCEP and other toxic chemicals through ingestion of plastic.278 \u201cSea \nbirds also ingest microplastics voluntarily,\u201d and peer-reviewed re search indicates that \u201cingested \nplastic debris [i]s a major source of plastic additives for sea birds.\u201d279 Further, in recent studies \n\u201c[t]he concentration of plastic additives in su rface waters and the a bundance of microplastic \nparticles were not correlated, implying that th ey are not necessarily good indicators for each \nother in this compartment.\u201d280 Accordingly, EPA\u2019s consideration of TCEP concentrations in \nsurface water and prey species do es not substitute for analyzing wildlife e xposures to TCEP from \ningested plastic. EPA must address this source of ingestion exposure in the final risk evaluation.   \n \n273 See id.  at 74,294 (stating that \u201cexclud[ing] certai n exposure pathways\u201d from a risk evaluation \n\u201cconflict[s] with the plain language of the law to evaluate chemical substances under the known, \nintended or reasonably foreseen circumstances asso ciated with the full lifecycle of the chemical \nsubstance\u201d and \u201cprevent[s] consideration of re levant exposure informat ion . . . in spite of \nstatutory requirements that the Agency base its decisions on the best  available science\u201d). \n274 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 94; see also id.  at 119, 138. \n275 Id. at 138. \n276 Id.  \n277 See NOAA Fisheries, Loggerhead Turtle , https://www.fisheries.noaa .gov/species/loggerhead-\nturtle  (last visited Jan. 25, 2024) (identifying distinct  population segments liste d as threatened or \nendangered under the Endangered Species Act). \n278 Berta Sala et al., First Study on the Presence of Plastic Additives in Loggerhead Sea Turtles \n(Caretta caretta ) from the Mediterranean Sea , 283 Env\u2019t Pollution Art No. 117108, at 1\u20132, 4\u20136 \n(2021); see also  Fauser et al.

EPA\u2019s Environmental Hazard Thresholds Are Not Sufficiently Protective of Aquatic \nSpecies  \nEPA\u2019s environmental hazard thre sholds are insufficiently pr otective of aquatic life. EPA \ncalculated a concentration of concern of 55.9 parts-per-bil lion (\u201cppb\u201d) for chronic TCEP \nexposure among aquatic species, based on a 14-day study of growth and de velopment effects in \nJapanese medaka, a fish species.281 However, a 2021 peer reviewed study (Zhao et al. 2021) \ndocumented adverse effects on juvenile yellow  catfish exposed to substantially lower \nconcentrations of TCEP over 30 days, incl uding significant adverse effects on growth, \nhistological changes to gills, and altered gene expression.282 Histological changes to gill cells \noccurred at doses as low as 1 \u03bcg/L, equivalent to 1 ppb, while adverse effects on growth and \nbody weight occurred at doses as low as 10 ppb.283 And at 100 ppb TCEP exposure, \u201cthe survival \nrate of juvenile yellow catfish . . . was signifi cantly decreased compared with the control after \n30-day exposure, which implied th at high environmental concentra tions of TCEP could threaten \nthe survival of juvenile yellow catfish.\u201d284 Based on this study and uti lizing the assessment factor \nof ten that EPA applied to calcu late its concentration of conc ern, Zhao et al. would support a \nconcentration of concern as low as 0.1 ppb (based  on histological changes to gill cells) or 1 ppb \n(based on growth effects). It does not appear th at EPA considered this study in developing the \ndraft risk evaluation, and it must do so in revising the draft a nd appropriately strengthen its \nhazard thresholds to protect aquatic life\u2014i ncluding the most sensitive species.  \nC. EPA Has Not Adequately Evaluated the Ri sks TCEP Presents to Birds, Marine \nMammals, Threatened and Endangered Sp ecies, and Other Species of Special \nConcern \nThe draft risk evaluation indi cates that EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s hazards to aquatic \norganisms and mammals rests on st udies in fish (for aquatic orga nisms) and mice and rats (for \nmammals),285 and that its risk characteri zation for terrestrial vertebra tes is based on an analysis \nof trophic transfer expos ures to American mink.286 EPA has not justified its failure to assess \nhazards and risks to other species in characterizing TCEP\u2019s risks to wildlife. EPA also failed to \nincorporate available literature and data in the dr aft risk evaluation that ar e relevant to assessing \nrisks to birds, marine mammals, and threatened  and endangered species. EPA must correct these \nomissions in the final risk evaluation to satisfy TS CA and ensure that its risk determinations and \n \n281 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104, 107. \n282 Yixin Zhao et al., Effects of Tris (2-chl oroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) on Survival, Growth, \nHistological Changes and Gene Expressions in Juvenile Yellow Catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco , \n87 Env\u2019t Toxicology & Phar macology Art No. 103699 (2021). \n283 Id. 7; see also id.  at 1, 3\u20134 (describing adverse effects on growth at 10 ppb TCEP exposure). \n284 Id. at 5. \n285 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104\u201306. \n286 Id. at 144. \n44 \n subsequent risk management ru le will protect wildlife species whose life histories and/or \nvulnerable conservation status  place them at greater ri sk from exposure to TCEP.287 \nAt the outset, EPA has not justified its relian ce on such a narrow set of wildlife species to \ncharacterize TCEP\u2019s environmental hazards. EPA\u2019 s ecological risk assessment guidance directs \nthe Agency to consider multiple criteria in se lecting \u201cassessment endpoin ts\u201d for ecological risk \nassessment, including a species \u2019 \u201c(1) ecological relevance, (2) susceptibility to known or \npotential stressors, and (3) re levance to management goals.\u201d288 \u201cOf these, ecological relevance \nand susceptibility are essential for selecting assessment endpoin ts that are scientifically \ndefensible.\u201d289 EPA has not justified its exclusive reli ance on fish and mouse/rat studies under \nthese criteria. \nFurther, EPA has not considered all reasonably available information that is relevant to \nevaluating TCEP\u2019s risks to species of special  ecological and conser vation concern\u2014including \nbut not limited to marine mammals. Aside from ci ting three studies reporti ng lipid concentrations \nof TCEP in aquatic mammals,290 the draft risk evaluation does not  discuss exposure or risks to \nthese species. This omission must be addresse d in the final risk ev aluation. TCEP and other \norganophosphates are widely dete cted in marine mammals,291 and a recent study documented \nsignificant biomagnification of the TCEP metabo lite bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (\u201cBCEP\u201d) in \nmarine mammals.292 Further, \u201c[m]arine mammals, such as  cetaceans and pinnipeds, are widely \nacknowledged as sentinel species to assess marine contamination status and health of marine \necosystem[s] due to being long-te rm inhabitants and long-lived apex predators at high trophic \nlevels in the marine ecosystem.\u201d293 As a result of their long life  spans, high trophic position in \naquatic food webs; and \u201cthick subcutaneous li pid layer (i.e. blubber),\u201d in which persistent \npollutants can accumulate, their exposure to and ri sks from persistent pollutants such as TCEP \n \n287 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(F)(i) (requ iring EPA to \u201cintegrate and assess available information on \nhazards and exposures . . . that is  relevant to specific risks of in jury to . . . the environment\u201d). \n288 EPA, EPA/630/R-95/002F, Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment  30 (Apr. 1998) \n(\u201cGuidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/site s/default/files/2014-\n11/documents/eco_r isk_assessment1998.pdf .  \n289 Id. \n290 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 96. \n291 See, e.g., Mengqin Chen et al., Tissue Distribution and Trophi c Transfer of Organophosphate \nTriesters and Diesters in Thr ee Marine Mammals of the Liaodong Bay and the Northern Yellow \nSea, 461 J.

In its avian exposure assessme nt,  EPA discusses only two studies \nmeasuring TCEP concentrations in bird eggs,296 disregarding a recent study, Choo et al. 2022, \nthat reported high concentrations  of TCEP in black gull eggs and a 377 percent increase in \nmeasured TCEP concentrations between 2012 to 2018.297 Further, it does not appear that EPA \nintegrated the available data on TCEP concentrati ons in bird eggs into its risk characterization.298 \nThis is problematic because the sensitivity of wildlife to chemical stressors \u201ccan be related to the \nlife stage of an organism when exposed to a st ressor,\u201d and \u201c[f]requently , young animals are more \nsensitive to stressors than adults.\u201d299  \nRegarding hazards to avian species, EPA asse rts that \u201conly a single high-quality study \nwas available for the American ke strel with no hazard value for the avian insectivore within [the] \nanalysis.\u201d300 This approach is not adequate to accura tely characterize TCEP exposures and risks \nto birds. The high TCEP concentrations in bl ack gull eggs reported in Choo et al. 2022 may \nreflect the study\u2019s assessment of birds that feed primarily on fi sh since, as EPA acknowledges, \n\u201cTCEP has the ability to quickly bioaccumulate in  fish tissue if it is exposed to high TCEP \nconcentration[s] in the surroundi ng water for a period of time.\u201d301 In the final risk evaluation, \nEPA should consider exposure and risk to fish-e ating birds.

EPA Must Assess Aggregate and Cumulative Risks to Wildlife  \nFinally, to satisfy its statutory mandate to u tilize the best available science, EPA\u2019s final \nrisk evaluation for TCEP must consider aggr egate and cumulative exposures and risks to \nwildlife.311 It is axiomatic that \u201corganisms do not live in single-stress situations. Rather they are \nconstantly exposed to a series of differen t stressors, both chemical and non-chemical.\u201d312 EPA\u2019s \nrisk evaluation cannot ignore this reality. \nRegarding aggregate exposures to TCEP among wildlife, EPA acknowledged but refused \nto consider them.313 This leads EPA to underestimate wildli fe exposures and risks and must be \ncorrected in the final risk evaluation. \nEPA likewise must correct its failure to consider  cumulative exposures and risks among \nwildlife. As NMFS has observed, \u201c[m] ixture effects case studies that have examined effects from \nthe interaction of [persistent orga nic pollutants] . . . demonstrate th at the interaction of pollutants \nis primarily synergistic and toxicity is enhance d, especially when the exposure to the chemical \nmixture is at a critical developmental growth period.\u201d314 Accordingly, NMFS has criticized \necological risk assessments that  focus on \u201chigh doses of [single] contaminants,\u201d which \u201cmay \nunderestimate risk . . . because some contaminan ts can interact at doses below the no observed \neffect concentrations (NOECs) and produce significant effects.\u201d315 Consideration of additive and \nsynergistic effects is particularly important in  the risk evaluation at hand given the extensive \nliterature documenting wildli fe species\u2019 co-exposures to TCEP along with other \norganophosphates, PBDEs, PCBs, phthalates, and additional contaminants that are known to \nexert common adverse health effects on animals.316 Further, there are established methods and \n \n310 See Sala et al.

EPA\u2019s Unreasonable Risk Thresholds Are Unsupported and Underprotective \n EPA\u2019s thresholds for determining whether TC EP presents unreasona ble cancer risk are \nunsupported, vague, and inconsistently applied. EPA has historically supported the use of a 1-in-\n1,000,000 cancer risk threshold under  TSCA, consistent with th e level used in other EPA \nprograms.319 In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA replaces that clear benchmark with \n\u201ca range of extra cancer risk from 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] to 1\u00d710\u22126 [1-in-1,000,000].\u201d320 There is \nno legal or scientific justification for that change. \n EPA sets the threshold for unreasonable o ccupational cancer risks at the less protective \nend of that range, claiming that, \u201c[c]onsistent wi th [National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health  (\u201cNIOSH\u201d)] guidance, u nder TSCA EPA typically applies a 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] \nbenchmark for occupational scenar ios in industrial and commercial  work environments subject \nto [Occupational Safety and Health  Administration]  requirements.\u201d321 This justification \nmisinterprets NIOSH guidelines, which describe 1-in-10,000 not as a target cancer risk level but \nrather \u201ca starting point for continually reduci ng exposures in order to reduce the remaining \nrisk.\u201d322 NIOSH goes on to say that \u201cfor most car cinogens, there is no known safe level of \nexposure\u201d and NIOSH will continue  to recommend that employers  reduce worker exposure to \noccupational carcinogens as much as possibl e through the hierarchy of controls, most \n \n317 See Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, Inc. et al., Comments on Draft Proposed Principles of \nCumulative Risk Assessment Under the Toxic Substances Control Ac t, at 29\u201330 (Apr. 28, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/co mment/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2022-0918-0035  (collecting examples). \n318 Gina Solomon et al., Integrating Environmenta l Justice into Public Health: Approaches for \nUnderstanding Cumulative Impacts , 5 Frontiers Pub.

EPA vaguely states that \u201c[e]xposure-related \nconsiderations ( e.g., duration, magnitude, popula tion exposed) can affect\u201d the reasonableness of \ncancer risk, but it does not explain how it will ap ply and weigh those considerations, opening the \ndoor to arbitrary and unprinc ipled risk determinations.328  \n Finally, the draft risk evaluation does not even adhere to EPA\u2019s own, weakened cancer \nrisk thresholds. EPA states that five conditions of use \u201cwere preliminary [sic] determined not to \ncontribute to the unreasonable ris k,\u201d including consumer uses of \u201cbuilding/construction materials \n\u2013 insulation.\u201d329 But according to EPA\u2019s risk calculati ons, \u201c[i]nhalation from insulation presents \nthe highest lifetime cancer risk (4.50\u00d710\u22122)\u201d to consumers.330 This calculated cancer risk of 4.5-\nin-100 is more than 450 times gr eater than the EPA\u2019s least protective, 1-in-10,000 unreasonable \n \n323 Id. \n324 Id.; see also  TSCA Sci.

EPA Should Not Calculate Existing Chemic al Exposure Limits During the Risk \nEvaluation   \n The purpose of a TSCA risk evaluation is to determine whether a chemical presents \nunreasonable risk that triggers the need for re gulation, not to prejudge potential regulatory \noptions. Congress separated EPA\u2019s decisions abou t how to manage unreasonable risk into a \ndistinct regulatory proce ss that follows the completion of a risk evaluation.\n331 Indeed, TSCA \nsection 6(c) enumerates factors that EPA \u201csha ll consider\u201d during the ri sk management process,332  \nwhich include \u201ccosts [and] other nonrisk fact ors\u201d that EPA is expressly precluded from \nconsidering in a TSCA risk evaluation.333 \nYet EPA blurs the line between risk eval uation and risk management by improperly \ncalculating Existing Chemical Exposure Limits (\u201cECELs\u201d)\u2014a risk mana gement tool\u2014in its \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation. Appendix N of the dr aft risk evaluation contains a \u201cDraft [ECEL]\u201d \nthat \u201cmay be used to support risk manageme nt efforts for TCEP under TSCA section 6(a).\u201d334  \nEPA even evaluates whether TCEP would be dete ctable at the draft ECEL value using existing \nair sampling methods, a \u201cnonrisk factor[]\u201d that EPA is barred from considering at this stage.335 \nNotably, EPA does not discuss any other risk mana gement approach in its  risk evaluation. For \ninstance, it does not consider whether engineering controls would eliminate TCEP\u2019s \nunreasonable risks to workers; whet her pretreatment requirements or other dispos al regulations \nwould address TCEP\u2019s disposal related risks; or whether a ba n on the manufacturing, processing, \nand commercial distribution of TCEP would be  more effective than EPA\u2019s draft ECEL. The \nanalysis of potential ECELs in the draft risk  evaluation suggests that EPA has impermissibly \nprejudged potential risk management measures, well before the risk management process has \neven begun. \nIn addition to being premature, EPA\u2019s draf t ECELs are underprotec tive and inconsistent \nwith TSCA\u2019s requirement to regulate TCEP \u201cto the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents [unreasonable] risk.\u201d336 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL of 0.09 mg/m3 TCEP, measured over an \neight-hour time-weighted average,337 falls short of that statutor y requirement. EPA determined \nthe draft ECEL based on the level of TCEP expos ures that are estimated to keep occupational \n \n331 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a)\u2013(b). \n332 Id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2). \n333 Id. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A) (prohibiting EPA from consider ing \u201ccosts or other nonrisk factors\u201d during \nthe risk evaluation stage); id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2)(A)(iv)(II) (r equiring EPA to consider \u201cthe costs and \nbenefits of the proposed and final regulatory  action\u201d during the risk  management stage). \n334 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation  at 568. \n335 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A). \n336 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n337 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 568. \n51 \n cancer risks at or below 1-in-10,000,338 a benchmark that accepts far greater occupational cancer \nrisks than EPA has found acceptable for consumers or the general public. Further, in calculating \nthat level, EPA assumes that workers would be  exposed to TCEP from a single exposure route \n(inhalation), via a single condition of use, without any out-of-w ork exposures from TCEP in their \nhomes or environment.339 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL would thus fail to eliminate unreasonable risks to \nworkers who are exposed to TCEP on and off the job, or, for example, fro m dermal contact as \nwell as inhalation. EPA also fails  to address how it plans to implement and enforce an ECEL \nwhen, by its own account, EPA has no idea where TCEP is manufactured and used. However, \nthose questions and others should be addressed during the TSCA ri sk management process, when \na proposed ECEL can be compared to other risk  management options. In  the meantime, draft \nECELs have no place in the TCEP risk evaluation.  \nX.  EPA Should Publish a Non-Technical Su mmary of the Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation \nThat Adheres to EPA Guidance and Best Practices on Risk Communication   \nThe TSCA risk evaluation rule requires \u201cEPA . . . to provide public access to . . . [a] \nnontechnical summary of the risk evaluation.\u201d340 The non-technical summa ry must allow people \nwho are adversely impacted by the chemical undergoing evaluation, su ch as workers, consumers, \nand residents of fenceline communities, to readily  identify what potential risks they face and how \nEPA calculated those risks. However, EPA did not provide a non-technical summary alongside \nthe draft TCEP risk evaluation. Th e closest that EPA comes to such  a summary is an overview of \nkey points at the beginning of a select number of chapters.341 Even then, these chapter summaries \nuse technical jargon and are difficult for the ge neral public to understand, and do not suffice as a \nsubstitute for the non-techni cal summary required by TSCA\u2019s  implementing regulations.342  \nEPA should have published a non-technical summary alongside the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation. Doing so would allow workers, co nsumers, and communitie s impacted by TCEP \nexposures to not only better unders tand the results of the TCEP risk  evaluation, but also to better \nengage in the comment period, whic h is the only formal opportunity  to express their views on the \nTCEP risk evaluation. By foregoing a non-technical summary at the draft risk evaluation stage, \nEPA fails to effectively communicate the results of the draft TCEP risk evaluation to people \nexposed to the chemical and fa cilitate their enga gement in the public  comment process. \n In addition to publishing a non-technical  summary, EPA should have conducted \nmeaningful outreach to tribes, fenceline co mmunities, labor unions , and other exposed \n \n338 Id. at 569. \n339 Id.  \n340 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.51(d). \n341 See, e.g.,  Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 39. \n342 See, e.g., id. at 157 (\u201cFor OESs that do not have data , EPA used relevant generic scenario \nand/or emission scenario documents to identify worker activities and exposure routes that are \nreasonably expected to occur.

In order to achieve effective risk \ncommunication, EPA must engage multiple impacted groups early in the risk evaluation process, \nas opposed to the end, and solicit th eir feedback on what informati on should be included in the \nnon-technical summaries, as well as the preferre d form and manner in wh ich the information is \ndelivered.344 \n Furthermore, we advise EPA to, at a minimum, adhere to the following risk \ncommunication principles recommended by EPA in the past and by the In terstate Technology and \nRegulatory Council (\u201cITRC\u201d).\n345 EPA should simplify its langu age in order to make non-\ntechnical summaries more digestible, and it should refrain from using any legal or scientific jargon. As mentioned above, in the chapter su mmaries included in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, EPA uses scientific, legal, and t echnical terms with which a layperson may be \nunfamiliar.\n346 EPA guidance from 2007 on risk communicat ion advises \u201ctranslat[ing] technical \nterms . . . into everyday language the public can ea sily understand,\u201d \u201cavoid[ ing] . . . jargon,\u201d and \n\u201cwrit[ing] short sentences.\u201d347 Similarly, the ITRC publishe d guidance regarding risk \ncommunication advises that writing for fact shee ts should be at \u201ca sixt h-grade comprehension \nlevel.\u201d348 EPA should do the same in its non-techni cal summary of the risk evaluation. \n \nEPA should also organize its summaries in a way that is easy fo r readers to process \ninformation. EPA should consider organizing its non-technical summaries in more reader-\n \n343 The recommended outreach to tribes to support effective risk communication is distinct from, \nand not a substitute for, EPA\u2019s obligation to e ngage in meaningful government-to-government \nconsultation with tribes concerni ng the TCEP risk evaluation.  \n344 See Mem. from Richard L.

As mentioned supra , EPA does not have \ninformation on where  TCEP is being released despite having  had more than sufficient time to \ncollect this data. We urge EPA to  collect this informat ion and adopt this pr actice for any future \nrisk evaluations. If EPA lacks this  information, such as is the ca se here, it should still provide \nnon-technical summaries in languag es other than English based on national statistics, such as \nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau, on language s spoken across the United States.  \n  Lastly, the information that EPA conveys through its non-technical  summaries should \ninclude the results that are most  relevant to impacted groups. EP A must provide a plain-language \nsummary of each \u201ccondition of us e\u201d so that fenceline residents, workers, and consumers can \neasily understand what processes or products can expose them to  risk, as opposed to vaguely \ndefined categories. For instance, the draft risk ev aluation says that TCEP is used in \u201cfabric and \ntextile products\u201d and \u201cfoam seating and bedding products,\u201d\n352 but it fails to specify that TCEP \nhas been detected in nursing pill ows, crib mattresses, yoga mats , and other products that people \nuse on a daily basis. We recomme nd that EPA describe the produc ts in which TCEP is found in \nmore accessible and relevant te rms, and also provide a clear and digestible illustration or \ninfographic to help the general public more eas ily understand their sources of exposure. EPA \nshould also strive to convey the results of its risk cal culations in a simple manner, so impacted \ngroups can better understand the degree of risk that they face.    We urge EPA to, at a minimum, publish a non- technical summary that adheres to the best \npractices laid forth above alongside the publishing  of the final TCEP risk evaluation, and going \nforward, to publish a non-technical summary that adheres to best practices for any future draft \nrisk evaluations in order to  increase meaningful engageme nt with impacted groups and \ncommunities.    \n \n349 See Risk Commc\u2019n Workbook at 8 (\u201cUse headings a nd other formatting techniques to provide \na clear and organized structure.); id. at 31 (\u201cMake fact sheets vi sually interesting by using \npictures, graphs, or diagrams to  accompany textual information.\u201d).   \n350 EPA, Fact Sheet, EP A\u2019 s Proposal to Limit PF AS in Drinking Water  (Mar. 2023), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n04/Fact%20Sheet_PFAS_NPWDR_Final_4.4.23.pdf .  \n351 ITRC FAQs.   \n352 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 27. \n54 XI. The SACC Should Have the Opportunity to Review the Draft Risk Evaluation in a\nPanel Peer Review Process With a Broadened Charge\nInstead of a full panel review of the draft TC EP risk evaluation, EPA intends to conduct a\n\u201cletter peer review\u201d in which a small number of SACC members individually review EPA\u2019s \ndraft.353 A letter review involves no public peer review meeting, no de liberation between the \nreviewers, and thus no opportunity for experts from different backgrounds and disciplines to \ndebate points of disagreeme nt and coalesce around common recommendations. For all those \nreasons, letter review is disfavor ed by EPA and by the SACC itself and should not be used for the \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation.   \nEPA\u2019s Peer Review Handbook advises against the use of letter  peer review for \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d like draft TSCA risk evaluations.354 The Handbook defines \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d (\u201cISI\u201d) as \u201cscientific information the agency reasonably can determine \nwill have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private-\nsector decisions.\u201d355 \u201cHighly influential scientific assessm ent\u201d (\u201cHISA\u201d), a s ubset of ISI, is \ndefined as \u201ca scientific assessment that: (i) could have a pot ential impact of more than $500 \nmillion in any year, or (ii) is novel, controversial, or precedent-setting or  has significant \ninteragency interest.\u201d356 TSCA risk evaluations\u2014which are intended to inform regulatory \ndecisions and which frequently i nvolve \u201cnovel\u201d scientif ic issues with \u201csig nificant interagency \ninterest\u201d \u2014are both ISI and HISA.357  The Handbook thus recommends that such risk \nevaluations undergo full panel review: \n[P]anels are preferable for influential products because they tend to bemore deliberative than individual lette r reviews and the reviewers can help\ninform one another. Panels are valuab le when the work product is complex\nand multidisciplinary. Panel peer re view meetings may be open to the\npublic, with opportunities for public comment.\n358\nMembers of the SACC have reached the same  conclusion. The peer reviewers of EPA\u2019s \nQuantitative Human Health Approach to be Applie d in the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2  \nwere highly critical of EPA\u2019s decision to use a letter review process, which they found \u201centirely \ninconsistent with the 40-year hist ory of EPA Science Advisory Pane ls\u201d and contrary to the \u201clegal \n353 Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate; Draft Risk Eval uation Under the Toxic S ubstances Control Act \n(TSCA); Letter Peer Review; Notice of Availabi lity, Public Meeting and Request for Comment, \n88 Fed.

TCEP should not be \nthe first. According to EPA, there are several \u201cn ovel\u201d aspects of the draft TCEP risk evaluation\u2014\nincluding EPA\u2019s approach to estimating aeria l deposition of TCEP, exposures to TCEP in \nbreastmilk, and drinking water cont amination from landfill leachate\u2014that EPA is using \u201cfor the \nfirst time\u201d under TSCA.\n362 Those issues and others would be nefit from the consideration and \ninput of the full SACC. EPA has ample time to schedule and conduc t a panel review of the draft \nTCEP risk evaluation, which can be held virtua lly consistent with EPA\u2019s post-2020 practice. We \nurge EPA to do so.   We are also concerned by the narrow char ge that EPA provided to prospective peer \nreviewers.\n363 EPA seeks input on discrete aspects of its  risk evaluation, such as \u201cthe approach \nthat EPA/OPPT took . . . to estimate anaerobic degradation\u201d and \u201chow EPA/OPPT calculated the \nHC 05,\u201d364 while ignoring the majo r uncertainties and data gaps th at EPA itself identified in its \nevaluation. For instance, EPA claims  that it \u201cdoes not have suffic ient information to determine \nwhether [six conditions of use] contribute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable ri sks,\u201d but it has not solicited \nthe SACC\u2019s advice on how it could fill those ga ps or otherwise cal culate those risks.365  EPA also \nsays that it \u201cwas not able to quantify releases of TCEP that could occur during the recycling of e-\nwaste,\u201d366 but it has not asked whethe r the SACC is aware of any da ta or methods that could \naddress that exposure pathway. Wherever EPA has identified uncertainties or data gaps, it should \nseek the SACC\u2019s advice on how to address them, along with a broader so licitation of feedback \non the strengths and weaknesses of the draft ri sk evaluation that extends beyond the narrowly \ntailored questions in the draft charge.   \n \n359 EPA, Peer Reviewer Comments on the White Pape r: Quantitative Human Health Approach to \nbe Applied in the Risk Evaluation for Asbest os Part 2\u2014 Supplemental Evaluation including \nLegacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos  15, 34 (Dec. 26, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/ document/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2023-0309-0020 .  \n360 Id. at 34. \n361 Id. at 15; see also id. at 34 (explaining that \u201cit is  particularly critical that true experts, who \nhave spent one, two or three decades evaluating the 16 or more relevant epidemiology studies, \nmeet with one another to discuss the st rengths and weaknesses of each study\u201d). \n362 88 Fed.

Reg. \n9088  (February 9 , 2023)  Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017 -0015 \n \n \n \nCOMMENTS OF  CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS, \nSIERRA CLUB, AND EARTHJUSTICE  \nSubmitted via regulations.gov and e -mail on March 11 , 2024  by Earthjustice  \nBACKGROUND  \n On July 24, 2020, EPA  promulgated a final air toxics rule for Lime \nManufacturing Plants (\u201cLime Kilns\u201d) that the agency knew to be flatly unlawful. \nAlthough the Clean Air Act unambiguously requires \u00a7 112-compliant limits for \neach hazardous air pollutant that a source category e mits and EPA knew that lime \nkilns emit hazardous air pollutants for which its existing \u00a7 112 standards provide \nno emission limits, EPA refused to promulgate the statutorily-required limits. EPA \nsought to justify its action by arguing it \u201cdoes not read CAA section 112(d)(6) as \ndirecting the Agency, as part of or in conjunction with the mandatory 8 -year \ntechnology review, to develop new emission standards to address HAP or  emission \npoints for which standards were not previously promulgated. \u201d 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960, \n44969 (July 24, 2020).  \n Approximately four months before  EPA published that rule, the D.C. Circuit \nhad already rejected the interpretation of \u00a7 112(d)(6) on which EPA purported to \nrely. In Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA, 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020), the Court held \u201c[t]he section 112(d)(6) requirement that EPA, when it \nundertakes its eight- year review, revise emission standards \u2018as necessary\u2019 means \n2 \n \n \n \n that EPA must conform them to the basic requisites of \u2018emission standards\u2019 under \nsection 112, including by setting controls on previously unaddressed hazardous air \npollutants.\u201d Id. at 1098.  Nonetheless, f ully aware that its interpretation of the Clean \nAir Act was unlawful, EPA nonetheless chose to rely on it and, indeed, reiterate it \nin refus ing emission limits for the uncontrolled hazardous air pollutants that Lime \nKilns  emit. 85 Fed. Reg. at 44969. EPA\u2019s action demonstrated contempt for the  \npeople the Clean Air Act was enacted to protect, for the Court that had clearly \nrejected the unlawful statutory interpretation EPA advanced, and for Congress, which enacted the statutory requirements that the agency steadfastly refused to \nobey for more than 20 years.  \nSierra Club challenged EPA\u2019s unlawful rule in the D.C. Circuit, Sierra Club \nv. EPA, D.C. Cir. No. 20 -1381 (filed September 22, 2020).  To give EPA a chance \nto correct its violation of the law voluntarily, Sierra Club also filed a petition for \nreconsideration under Clean Air Act \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -\n0065 . \nNotably, EPA promulgated the illegal 2020 air toxics rule for Lime Kilns \nyears after the Clean Air Act required the agency to issue lawful standards, and the agency acted only after a court ordered it to do so. See Blue Ridge Environmental \nDefense League v. Pruitt , 261 F. Supp. 3d 53 (D.D.C. 2017) (\u201c BREDL \u201d). In 2021,  \nEPA returned to the district court and admitted that its 2020 rule did not satisfy the \nClean Air Act or even its obligations under the district court\u2019s order to promulgate \nthe overdue rule in BREDL. Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), Joint Motion to Extend Deadlines under Court Order, \nApril 13, 2021, Ex. A . hereto.  EPA sought and obtained consent of plaintiffs and \nthe court in BREDL  for an extension of the deadline to give the agency a chance to \nbring its rule into compliance with the statute.  Id. The deadline for EPA to issue a \nrule that complied with the Clean Air Act and satisfied the district court\u2019s order was extended to February 23, 2023.  \nShortly, before the final rule was due, EPA sought and obtained a second \nextension of the deadline, to August 1, 2023, claiming its \u201canalysis here took \n3 \n \n \n \n longer than expected.\u201d Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, \nD.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), EPA\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Extend Deadline, January \n23, 2023, Ex. B. \nIn July of the same year, EPA sought yet another extension. Requesting  an \nentire yea r of further delay, EPA claimed  \nSome comments challenged underlying assumptions that EPA had \nmade when it decided, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that the proposal would not have \u201ca significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 605(b). Because EPA can no longer certify that the proposal would not have such effects, \nthe agency now plans to convene a review panel under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n609(b), invite public comments on an initial regulatory flexibility \nanalysis, and issue a final regulatory flexibility analysis to accompany \nthe final rule . See id. \u00a7\u00a7 603- 04.      \nBlue Ridge Environmental Defense League v. Regan, D.D.C. No. 16 -364 (CRC), \nEPA\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Extend Deadline, July 20, 2023, Ex. C  (emphasis \nadded) . \n Despite its representations to plaintiffs and the court, EPA used the \nextension not merely to conduct the SBREFA analysis described in its motion but \nto pursue its apparent policy goal of weakening the Lime Kilns rule to benefit industry at the expense of people who are exposed to Lime Kilns\u2019 toxic emissions. \nEPA did not inform  the court or plaintiffs or the court that it was going to propose \nsuch amendments when it obtained consent for the extension  or, indeed, that it was \ngoing to use the time to anything other than conduct SBREFA analysis.  Nor did \nEPA mention that it was engaged in proposing such amendments at any subsequent \npoint before publishing the weakening amendments in the Federal Register.  \n4 \n \n \n \n COMMENTS  \nI. EPA WOULD VIOLATE THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND ACT \nARBITRARILY BY SETTING A \u201cHEALTH-BASED EMISSION LIMIT\u201d FOR HYDROGEN CHLORIDE.  \nEPA seeks comment on a request by the Small Business Advocacy Review \nPanel to set a \u201chealth -based emission limit\u201d (HBEL) for hydrogen chloride (HCl) \nthat is even weaker than the HCl limit EPA proposed. 89 Fed. Reg. 9088, 9092 \n(February 9, 2024). It is wort h providing some context for EPA\u2019s consideration of \nthis request. \u201c The mission of EPA is to protect human health and the \nenvironment.\u201d https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our -mission -and-what -we-do. Given \nthis mission, one might expect EPA would be an advocate for \u201chuman health and \nthe environment\u201d  and to represent ordinary Americans\u2019 interests in being protected \nfrom toxic pollution  at least as zealously as it represents business owners\u2019 \neconomic interests . As is plainly evidenced by EPA\u2019s biased and one -sided \narguments in favor of the HBEL and EPA \u2019s complete failure to consider or even \nmention the reasons against  issuing one that the agency  articulated and \nsuccessfully defended in its air toxics rule for industrial boilers, see U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d 579, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2016) , the agency has a bandoned or lost track \nof this mission . \nClean Air Act \u00a7 112(d)(4) provides that, \u201c [w]ith respect to pollutants for which \na health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider  such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission \nstandards under this subsection.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4). Nothing in the text of \nthis provision authorizes EPA to set limits that are less stringent than those \nrequired by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). To the contrary, the text of the statute indicates that \nCongress intended EPA to consider  health thresholds, where they have been \nestablished, as a factor in making the limits that EPA promulgates under \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) more  stringent. Indeed, by providing that thresholds be \n\u201cconsider[ed]\u201d \u201cwhen establishing emission standards under this subsection ,\u201d Id. \n(emphasis added) , the statutory text indicates that Congress wanted (d)(4) to \nprovide for more stringent standards. Specifically, \u00a7  112(d)(2) provides that \n5 \n \n \n \n standards \u201cpromulgated under this subsection\u201d must meet the stringency \nrequirements in \u00a7 112(d)(2) and (d)(3). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). Because \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) requires the \u201cmaximum\u201d reductions that are achievable \u201cincluding a \nprohibition on emissions where ach ievable,\u201d reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as authorizing \nmore stringent standards is consistent with \u00a7 112(d)(2). Reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as \nallowing standards that are less stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 i.e., that do not \ncomply with these provisions \u2013 is inconsistent with \u00a7 112(d)(4)\u2019s directive to \nconsider health thresholds \u201cwhen establishing emission standards.\u201d Id.    \nIn the past, EPA has invoked a floor statement by then Senator Durenberger  \nas authority for reading \u00a7 112(d)(4) as allowing it to set limits that are less \nstringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3). In its 1998 rule for pulp and paper \nmills,  for example,  EPA stated  \nWith respect to the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, \nthe authority to set a standard less stringent than maximum achievable \ncontrol  technology is contained in subsection (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and  other non- threshold pollutants, no such  authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act.  \n63 Fed. Reg. 18,754, 18,765 (April 15, 1998) (quoting Environment and Public \nWorks, A  Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at \n876, statement of Senator Durenberger during Senate Debate of October 27, 1990).  \n \n A floor statement does not trump the statutory text. Because the text of \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) does not authorize EPA to set limits less stringent than those required \nby \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) \u2013 and strongly indicates that Congress intended only that EPA \nconsider more str ingent limits under these provisions \u2013 EPA cannot rely on Senator \nDurenberger\u2019s floor statement for authority to set limits that are less stringent than \n\u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require.  \n  Assuming arguendo  that \u00a7 112(d)(4) does authorize EPA to issue limits that \nless stringent than \u00a7 112(d)(2) -(3) require in some circumstances, doing so for HCl \nwould still be unlawful. As EPA itself explains:   \n   \n6 \n \n \n \n The EPA presumptively applies section 112(d)(4) only to HAP\u2019s that \nare not carcinogens because Congress clearly intended that \ncarcinogens be considered nonthreshold pollutants . \u2026 \u201cWith respect \nto the pollutants for  which a safe threshold can be set, the  authority to \nset a standard less stringent than maximum achievable control \ntechnology is contained in subsection  (d)(4). With respect to \ncarcinogens and other non- threshold pollutants, no such authority \nexists in subsection (d) or in any other provision of the Act. \u201d \n63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (quoting Staff of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, A Legislative History of the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 1990, Vol. 1 at 876,  statement of Senator Durenberger \nduring Senate Debate of October 27, 1990) (emphasis added).  EPA has \nnever altered its interpretation of what \u201cCongress clearly intended.\u201d To the \ncontrary, EPA has reiterated it consistently over the last two decades. See, \ne.g., 75 Fed. Reg. 32,006, 32,031 (June 4, 2010); Sierra Club v. EPA, D.C. \nCir. No. 15 -1487 (filed April 28, 2017)  (\u201cEPA Brick Kilns Brief) , Ex. D \nhereto, at 23 (citing 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, 79,639 (December 18, 2014).    \n Notably, the D.C. Circuit has upheld EPA\u2019s refusal to set a HBEL for HCl \nbecause, inter alia, it did not \u201cconsider the potential acute or carcinogenic effects \nthat might be caused by HCl exposure.\u201d U.S. Sugar v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 624 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031). Conversely, where EPA sought to \nset a HBEL for HCl, the D.C. Circuit found EPA\u2019s action unlawful because the \nagency failed to carry its burden of showing with \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl \nis not carcinogenic.  Sierra Club v.  EPA, 895 F.3d 1, 10- 11 (D.C. Cir. 2018).   \nIn the supplemental proposal, EPA does not provide substantial evidence \nthat HCl is not carcinogenic or, indeed, even attempt to provide any showing at all. \nFor this reason alone, issuing a HBEL for HCl would be unlawful and arbitrary.  \nEvidently seeking to evade the holding in Sierra Club  and its own consistent \ninterpretation of the Clean Air Act, EPA claims to \u201cnow recognize[]\u201d that \ncarcinogens can be \u201cthreshold pollutants.\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092 (citing EPA, \nGuidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (2005)). Thus, EPA seeks to bypass \nthe fact that it lacks substantial evidence to show that HCl is not a carcinogen by \n7 \n \n \n \n now claiming it  is irrelevant whether HCl is a carcinogen and the agency does not \nhave to make any such showing.   \n EPA\u2019s claim to have  newly \u201crecognize[d]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold \npollutants  \u2013 based on a n EPA guidance document from 2005  \u2013 is irrelevant under \nthe Clean Air Act.  Because \u201c Congress clearly intended that carcinogens be \nconsidered nonthreshold pollutants,\u201d 63 Fed. Reg. at 18,765 (emphasis added), \nEPA\u2019s  views on whether carcinogens can be considered threshold pollutants do not \nmatter.  The meaning of the Clean Air Act does not change just because EPA\u2019s \nviews on whether carcinogens are threshold pollutants change. Where Congress \nhas clearly expressed its intent, EPA\u2019s job is to effectuate that intent, not to subvert \nit, regardless of whether EPA\u2019s views have come to differ from the clearly \nexpressed intent of Congress.  \nFurther, if it existed at all, but see supra, EPA\u2019s purported authority to set \nlimits under \u00a7 112(d)(4) that are less stringent than those required by \u00a7 112(d)(2) -\n(3) comes not from the statutory text but Senator Durenberger\u2019s floor statement.  63 \nFed. Reg. at 18,765.  That is the only authority EPA has ever cited for this reading \nof \u00a7 112(d)(4). And if that floor statement truly expressed Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA can set less stringent limits under \u00a7 112(d)(4), it would equally express \nCongress\u2019s \u201cclear[] inten[ t] that carcinogens be considered nonthreshold  \npollutants.\u201d Id. Thus, if EPA wants to issue a HBEL for HCl it must establish with \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not a carcinogen \u2013  as the D.C. Circuit has already \nmade plain to EPA. Sierra Club , 895 F.3d at 10- 11. \n Remarkably, the supplemental proposal does not even mention EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the statute. EPA does not acknowledge that its purported \n\u201crecogni[tion]\u201d that carcinogens can be threshold pollutants conflicts directly with \nits own repeated findings that Congress clearly intended that carcinogens cannot be \ntreated as threshold pollutants. EPA does not say why it believes itself entitled to \ntreat carcinogens as threshold pollutants, despite its understanding that Congress \n\u201cclearly\u201d did not intend such tre atment of them. Nor does EPA purport to alter its \nstatutory interpretation, let alone provide a reasoned basis for doing so.  For this \nreason as well, EPA\u2019s action is unlawful. See, e.g. , Encino Motorcars v. Navarro, \n579 U.S. 211, 221- 222 (2011).  \n8 \n \n \n \n  Likewise, EPA makes no attempt to reconcile its apparent current position \nthat the lack of research into whether HCl is carcinogenic is irrelevant, 89 Fed. \nReg. at 9,092, with its previous finding that the lack of conclusive research is a \nreason not to is sue a HBEL for HCl, 75 Fed. Reg. at 32,031. See U.S. Sugar v. \nEPA, 830 F.3d at 624. Indeed, EPA does not even see fit to acknowledge the \nposition it took in the boilers rule and the U.S. Sugar case, let alone provide a \nrational basis for departing from it.  \n Even if EPA were free to ignore  the text of the statute,  Sierra Club, and the \nagency\u2019s own long-held interpretation of the Clean Air Act and issue a HBEL for \nHCl without showing that HCl is not carcinogenic, setting a HBEL for HCl based \non the supplemental proposal would be unlawful and arbitrary. Once again, just as \nin Sierra  Club , EPA  assumes it can equate absence of evidence with evidence of \nabsence . See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. The only difference here is that EPA \ndeploys that assumption to claim it can treat HCl as a threshold pollutant rather \nthan to claim it can treat HCl as a non-carcinogen. Compare  89 Fed. Reg.  9092  \nwith Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10 -11. See also EPA Brick Kilns Brief at 23- 25. \n Having disavowed any obligation to show that HCl is not carcinogenic , EPA \nnext claims \u201c[a]n important consideration when determining if a carcinogen has a \nthreshold is whether it is mutagenic .\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. at 9,092.  Even assuming \narguendo  that EPA can simply bypass the need to show that a pollutant is not \ncarcinogenic, EPA does not and cannot claim that mutagenicity is the sole test for \nwhether a pollutant has a threshold, either for cancer of any other health harm. \nEPA does not discuss all the other indicators of whether a pollutant has a threshold, \nlet alone why it has chosen not to consider them.  \nFurther, f ar from providing \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that HCl is not \nmutagenic, EPA makes clear that the current evidence regarding whether HCl is mutagenic is outdated and , at best,  equivocal.  All EPA claims is that \u201c[i]n the case \nof HCl, the available evidence does not indicate that HCl has a mutagenic effect.\u201d Id. That is precisely the same lack of evidence sought to rely on in Sierra Club, \nand falls far short of the required demonstration with substantial evidence that HCl is not mutagenic.  See 895 F.3d a t 10-11. \n9 \n \n \n \n Indeed,  apart from a 1992 study on \u201cbacteria,\u201d  the only studies EPA can \nidentif y indicate that HCl is  mutagenic  in mammals . Id. EPA seeks to discount \nthese studies by claiming \u2013 without providing any citation whatsoever \u2013 that some \nunidentified researchers have found in unidentified research that these results were \ncaused by exceptionally high doses of HCl.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092.  EPA\u2019s  citation -\nfree and unsubstantiated  critique of the only mammalian evidence  it has \u2013 evidence  \nshowing  that HCl is mutagenic  \u2013 scarcely  amounts to  a demonstration with  \nsubstantial evidence that HCl is not  carcinogenic.  See Sierra Club, 895 F.3d at 10-\n11. \nEPA\u2019s attempt to rely on \u201c[ a]nother important consideration,\u201d the \nmechanisms that can cause cancer, is similarly flawed. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. EPA \nstates that increased cell production and tissue enlargement, known as hyperplasia, \ncan lead to cancer. Id.  EPA further states that an animal study has shown that HCl \nexposure cause s hyperplasia in rats. Id.  Then, however \u2013  just as with mutagenicity \n\u2013 EPA seeks to discount its own evidence by arguing that the  same study did not \nshow that HCl caused the rats to ge t cancer. Id . But it is EPA\u2019s argument that \nhyperplasia, as a purported \u201cmechanism\u201d of cancer, is relevant to whether HCl is a pollutant for which a cancer threshold exist.  EPA\u2019s only evidence is that HCl does  \ncause hyperplasia.  Therefore, EPA\u2019s hyperplasia argument  scarcely demonstrates \nwith substantial evidence that HCl is not  a threshold pollutant.  As for EPA\u2019s claim \nthat the study does not demonstrate HCl causes cancer , it is irrelevant. It is EPA \u2019s \nburden to demonstrat e with substantial evidence that HCl does not cause cancer . \nSierra Club.  895 F.3d at 10 -11. EPA does not claim that its 1995 rat study provides \nsuch evidence, nor could it. Id.  \nEPA next claims to have \u201c similarly recognized the existence of a  threshold \nof exposure for hyperplasia  and resulting cancer outcomes from  exposure to \nchloroform.  89 Fed. Reg. at 9092- 9093 The agency claims \u201c[c] hloroform was \nlabeled as likely to be carcinogenic to  humans under high -exposure conditions  that \ncause hyperplasia. However, the  EPA concluded that chloroform is not likely to be \ncarcinogenic to humans  under exposure conditions that do not cause hyperplasia. \u201d \nId. That argument merely underscores the e xtent to which EPA is defying what the \nagency itself describes as Congress\u2019s clear intent that carcinogens not be treated as \n10 \n \n \n \n threshold pollutants. Chloroform is, by EPA\u2019s own finding, a probable human \ncarcinogen.  https://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA has \nnever claimed chloroform is a threshold pollutant, let alone identified a threshold \nbelow which it does not cause cancer . EPA\u2019s new suggestion that it can treat \nchloroform as a threshold pollutant is a good example of why OMB cautioned EPA \nthat its new approach was \u201cprecedential\u201d and urged  the agency to seek \u201cexternal  \nscientific review before considering finalizing a threshold proposal. \u201d OMB Review \nDraft at 20 (emphasis added).  \nAlthough EPA did not find that chloroform is a threshold pollutant, as the \nagency now inaccurately suggests, it did find the chloroform is a probable \ncarcinogen based on  evidence that it causes hyperplasia. \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=25 . EPA also has \nevidence that HCl causes hyperplasia. 89 Fed. Reg. at 9092. Thus, EPA\u2019s new \narguments about HCl are not \u201csimilar\u201d to those underlying the chloroform finding, \nid. To the contrary, EPA discounts the finding that HCl caused hyperplasia because \nthe study did not also show that HCl caused cancer . Nowhere does EPA explain \nwhy, if it believes hyperplasia is a mechanism for carcinogenicity sufficient to \ndemonstrate that chloroform causes cancer  even without an independent direct \nfinding that chloroform causes cancer , it does not reach the same conclusion for \nHCl.     \n Further , EPA states only that HCl cause s hyperplasia in rats.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n9092.  It does not claim to have identified any level below which HCl does not \ncause  hyperplasia in rats , let alone people.  Thus, even if EPA identified a threshold \nbelow which  chloroform  did not cause hyperplasia \u2013 which it has not \u2013  that \nsituation  would not be \u201csimilar[] ,\u201d id.  \nRemarkably, the record shows EPA so eager to substitute its new views for \nwhat the agency itself has described as Congress\u2019s clear intent that it ignored cautionary comments from the Office of Management and Budget. In its review of \nEPA\u2019s proposal under EO 12866, OMB commented \nHas EPA\u2019s approach here for HCl and under 112(d)(4) been peer \nreviewed by the SAB, since EPA\u2019s action here appears to be \n11 \n \n \n \n precedential? Recommend seeking comment on whether EPA should \nseek such external scientific review before considering finalizing a \nthreshold proposal.  \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017-0015 -0201 (\u201cOMB Review Draft\u201d) at 20 (emphasis added). \nThen, after EPA apparently refused to alter its approach, seek peer review by SAB, \nor even seek comment on the need for \u201csuch external scientific\u201d review, OMB requested in a second round of comments that EPA at least take comment on \nwhether \u201c any additional scientific evidence of this health- based threshold proposal \nfor hyperplasia is available that would help inform EPA in their risk assessment \nand subsequent decision -making \u2026 and \u201c[w] hether additional external scientific \nreview is needed before finalizing a threshold- based proposal, since EPA\u2019s \nsupplemental proposed action under 112(d)(4) appears, if true, to be precedent. \u201d Id. \nEvidently, OMB\u2019s comments were futile. EPA\u2019s new approach has not been \npeer reviewed by SAB, and EPA made no effort to seek comment on seeking SAB \nreview, despite OMB\u2019s identification of its new approach to the evaluation of \ncancer risk as \u201cprecedential.\u201d Apparently, EPA did not seek \u201cany\u201d additional \nexternal scientific review or evidence. In any event, EPA does not mention OMB\u2019s concerns in its proposal, let alone respond to them or identify any external review \nor evidence that address those concerns.  \nII. EPA \u2019S APPROACH TO CANCER RISK IS ARBITRARY AND \nINCONSISTENT WITH  ITS OWN GUIDELINES.  \nAs outlined in the 2005 Carcinogenic Risk Assessment Guidelines \n(\u201cGuidelines\u201d), it has long been EPA\u2019s policy and practice to presume that \ngenotoxic carcinogens do not have a known threshold of exposure and thus, no \ndose is safe .\n1 A second practice is that of emplo ying linear extrapolation for  \nchemicals that undergo carcinogenic risk assessment and are found to act via a mutagenic mode of action, unless it can be demonstrated unequivocally that a \nchemical acts via a non- mutagenic mode of action.   \n \n1 EPA, Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment ( \u201cGuidelines \u201d) at 1- 11 (2005),  \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2013 -09/documents/cancer_guidelines_final_3- 25-05.pdf .  \n12 \n \n \n \n Indeed, the Guidelines state that \u201c[w] hen the weight of evidence evaluation \nof all available data are insufficient to establish the mode of action for a tumor site \nand when scientifically plausible based on the available data, linear extrapolation is \nused as a default approach (emphasis added) , because linear extrapolation \ngenerally is considered to be a health- protective approach. Nonlinear approaches \ngenerally should not be used in cases where the mode of action has not been ascertained.\u201d\n2 For clarity on what is meant by \u2018nonlinear\u2019, footnote 3 on page  16 \nstates \u201c[t] he term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used here in a narrower sense than its usual \nmeaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer guidelines, the \nterm \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range \nof low doses that include ze ro) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic \nmodel, which shows some response at all doses above zero). \u201d3 The Guidelines \nmake clear that nonlinear or threshold approaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \nEPA  has not met its own standard in its current analysis, in the absence of a \ntoxicological risk assessment that evaluated HCl for its carcinogenic potential.\n4 \nMoreover, EPA\u2019s proposal to set a health- based exposure level based on the \npresumption of an existing threshold is no t in accordance  with other federal \nguidelines, including the FDA Guidance for Industry S2B Genotoxicity: A \nStandard Battery for Genotoxicity Testing of Pharmaceuticals, states, \u201cCompounds which are positive in tests that detect such kinds of damage [damage to DNA] have the potential to be human carcinogens and/or mutagens, i.e., may induce cancer \n \n2 Guidelines at 3- 21. \n3 Guidelines at 1- 11. \n4 See Guidelines at  3-21: \u201cWhen the weight of evidence evaluation of all available data are insufficient to \nestablish the mode of action for a tumor site and when scientifically plausible based on the available data, \nlinear extrapolation is used as a default approach, because linear  extrapolation generally is considered to \nbe a health -protective approach . Nonlinear approaches generally should not be used in cases where the \nmode of action has not been ascertained. \u201d Footnote at 3 section 1- 11states \u201c The term \u201cnonlinear\u201d is used \nhere in a narrower sense than its usual meaning in the field of mathematical modeling. In these cancer \nguidelines, the term \u201cnonlinear\u201d refers to threshold models (which show no response over a range of low \ndoses that include z ero) and some nonthreshold models (e.g., a quadractic model, which shows some \nresponse at all doses above zero). \u201d Importantly, the Guidelines make clear that nonlinear or threshold \napproaches should not be employed in the absence of an established mode of action.  \n13 \n \n \n \n and/or heritable defects.\u201d5 Further supporting this approach, a 2006 scientific \nreview article by EPA staff person, Michael Cimino, reported that, \u201cThe default \nregulatory assumption is that chemicals that are genotoxic in standard tests can \ncause mutations in humans (in somatic and/or germ cells), and can contribute to \nadverse health outcomes, such as cancer, via a genotoxic or mutagenic mode of \n(toxic) action (MOA).\u201d6  \nNotably, EPA\u2019s staff co -published a  peer reviewed article  describ ing that \ndifferent carcinogens act via multiple mechanisms or MOA\u2019s and it can be \nchallenging to determine which is the main MOA, especially when considering \ndifferences in exposure at different life stages and at differential doses.7 This notion \nis reinforced  by comments submitted by Joseph Landolph, a n exp ert and reviewe r \nof EPA \u2019s draft Framework for Determining a Mutagenic M ode of Action for \nCarcinogenicity  (\u201cFramework \u201d). While the Framework was never finalized, in \nresponse to a charge question referr ing to the clarity and c ompleten ess of the \nFramework, Landolph \u201cstrongly recommend[ ed] adding that if a mutagenic \nchemical carcinogen does not have a conc lusive mutagenic MOA, but no other \nevidence exists to conclusively document a non-mutagenic MOA, then this \nchemical  is treated as acting by a mutagenic MOA for risk  assessment and \nregulatory p urposes.  For risk  assessment purpose s, this chemical is presum ed to \nfollow a linear, no threshold dose -response curve for cancer induction. \u201d8 Landolph \nis supported by subject matter  exper t\u2019s understanding that even when the MOA is \n \n5 FDA, Guidance for Industry S2B Genotoxicity: A Standard Battery for Genotoxicity Testing of \nPharmaceuticals  at page 1 ( July 1997) .

IN THE ABSENCE  OF A  CARCIN OGEN IC RISK E VALUATION , EPA \nHAS NOT PROVIDED S UBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT HCL CAN \nBE TREATED AS A  THRESHOLD  POLLU TANT.   \nEPA \u2019s Information Risk Information System ( \u201cIRIS \u201d) database for \ntoxicol ogical assessments for HCl states that qu antitative estimates of either \ncarcinogenic risk from oral  and/or inhalation exposure were \u201cnot assessed under \nthe IRIS Program \u201d.10 Indeed, while the proposed rule makes reference  to the \n \n9 See Exhibits E and F, TSCA eva luation comments submitted by UCSF P RHE  as well as Ea rthjus tice \ncomments published  on docket EPA -HQ-OPPT- 2023- 0265- 0005, which  reference the N ational Resource \nCouncil \u2019s Science and Decisions: Advanc ing Risk Assessment (2009)  and state: \u201c The absence of a known \nmutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other \nMOAs can operate with no threshold. Further, the  NASEM states that human variability, exposure to \nother chemicals, and background disease  processes alone can result in linear dose- response relationships \nat low doses, regardless of  whether mutagenic MOAs are known:  Background exposures and underlying \ndisease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population \ndoses of concern. The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for  \nmechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose- response relationship  can be linear at a \nlow dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease  process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to \nbackground processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a \nbaseline level of  dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the  \nbackground process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That  may be difficult to  \nmeasure because of background noise in the system but may be  addressed through dose -response \nmodeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic \ncancer mechanism can result in linear dose response  relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, \nnonlinear dose -response  processes\u2014 for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor \nsurveillance,  DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles \u2014may be found to  \ncause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background  processes, given \ncancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures  and high variability in human \nsusceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low -dose linear dose -response relationships in the \nhuman population.\u201d   \n10 EPA, Hy drogen Chloride Cancer Assessment ( n.d). Available at : \nhttps://iris.epa.gov/ChemicalLanding/&substance_nmbr=396 .  \n15 \n \n \n \n assertion  that \u201cEPA no w recognizes that car cinogen s can be either non- threshold or \nthreshold  polluta nts\u201d11, Commenters have shown such a statement to be  out-of-step \nwith its own practi ces and policy . EPA  has not  evaluated HCl for it s carcinogenic \npotential. To further demonstrate its lack of substantial evidence, EPA \u2019s proposal \nreference s a single animal study that  was used to derive a noncancer  reference \nconcentration after finding hyperplasia of the nasal mucosa larynx and trachea  in \nrats.  \nThe a forementioned study was use d to derive a  point of departure for the \nreference concentration for HCl and utilized the  lowest observed adverse effect \nlevel (\u201cLOA EL\u201d), which is less preferential when compared to the more significant \nno observed adverse effect level (\u201cNO AEL\u201d) or even a benchmark dose.12 By \nEPA\u2019s definition, the NOAEL  is \u201can experimentally determined dose at which \nthere was no statistically or biologically significant indication of the toxic effect of \nconcern\u201d and only in instances where a NOAEL \u201chas not been demonstrated \nexperimentally, the term LOAEL is used.\u201d13 While EPA did include an uncertainty \nfactor for having to extrapolate from a LOAEL to NOAEL , the critical study used \nto derive the reference concentration failed to identify a level at which no effect \noccurred  and as such, the single study for which EPA is relying on failed to \nprovide definiti ve evidence that a no  effect level ( or a threshold of exposure ) exists \nfor HCl . This  recognition is signi ficant  given th at EPA  argues HCl should be \ntreated as a threshold polluta nt even in the absence  of adequate carcinogenicity  \nstudies.   \nGenotoxicity studies, which are designed to \u201cdetect compounds that induce \ngenetic damage by various mechanisms\u201d14 are not widely available for HCl. Very \nfew studies have explored either genotoxicity or carcinogenicity, and yet the \n \n11 89 Fed.

In \nreality, from the few identified studies evaluating genotoxicity, at least two identified concentrations at which HCl was found to induce a response: in a 1981 \nstudy , the Escherichia coli DNA -repair assay  was positive at a concentration of 25 \nug/well a s well as a s eparate s tudy finding chromosomal nondisjunction induced at \na concentration of 100 ppm in Drosophila melanogaster in 2008.\n15 Chromosomal \nnondisjunction is a phenomena where the chromosomes fail to separate, producing daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes. This is also considered a \nmolecular initiating event, which is defined as \u201cthe initial interaction between a molecule and a biomolecule or biosystem that can be causally linked to an outcome \nvia a pathway\u201d.\n16 Molecular initiating events are a sequence of events that go along \nwith the adverse outcome pathway framework and serve as the basis for \ndetermining genotoxicity and in turn, the potential for mutagenicity. The \nassessment of HCl\u2019s ability to induce a positive response in at least two separate \nstudies provides evidence that exposure to HCl is mechanistically linked to potential genotoxic and potentially mutagenic outcomes (which cannot be rule d \nout).  \nFinally, Commenters draw attention to a fa tal flaw associated with EPA\u2019s \nnoncancer risk value for HCl. A ccording to CalEPA\u2019s Office of E nvironmenta l \nHealth Hazard Assessment (\u201cOEHHA \u201d), EPA itself rated its HCl database as \u201clow -\nconfidence \u201d given \u201c(1) the use of only one dose; (2) limited toxicity evaluation; (3) \nthe lack of reproductive toxicity data; and (4) the lack of chronic exposure \n \n15 National Research Council (US) , Committee on Emergency and Continuous Exposure Guidance Levels \nfor Selected Submarine Contaminants.

EPA\u2019S PROPOSED RISK APPROACH TO ASSESS A H EALTH-BASED \nEMISSION LIMITATION  FOR HYDROCHLORIC ACID FOR THE LIME \nMANUFACTURING SOURCE CATEGORY ( 2023) MEMORANDUM IS \nFLAWED  AND UNDE RESTIMATES THE NONCANCER RISK  \nASSOCIATED WITH HCL E XPOSURE . \nEPA has requested comment on w hether its proposed  risk analysis  and \nsubsequent  extrapolation of an  emission limit of 300 tons per year ( \u201ctpy\u201d) would \nprovide an a mple margin of safe ty. In reviewing the Memorandum  entitled , Risk \nApproach to Assess a H ealth -Based Emission Limitation  for Hydrochloric Acid for \nthe Lime Manufacturing Source Category  (\u201c2023 Memo \u201d), Comme nters have \nidentified several  flaws , including EPA \u2019s unjustified use of a weaker noncancer \nrisk value , its continued underestimation  of noncancer risk s, and its \nunsubstantiated  proposed risk approach.   \nBy failing to use the California OEHHA Reference Exposure Level (REL) to \nevaluate  acute and chronic risk of HCl exposure  EPA underestimates  risks.  \nTo ensure it follows the best available science, EPA should use the latest \nOEHHA risk exposure level ( \u201cREL \u201d) for HCl. EPA has not provide d adequate \nrationale for choosing to ignore OEHHA \u2019s REL , which is an order of magnitude \nstronger than EPA\u2019s RfC.18 \nRefusing to follow the OEHHA noncancer risk value conflicts with the Act\u2019s \ndirection to employ the best available science, and with EPA\u2019s own scientific risk \nassessment guidelines. As EPA admits, EPA has long recognized that OEHHA \u2019s \n\u201cprocess for developing [dose -response assessments] is similar to that used by EPA \n \n17 OEHHA, Appendix D.3 Chronic RELs and toxicity summaries using the previous version of the Hot \nSpots Risk Assessment guidelines (OEHHA 1999)  at 309-312.

Instead , it uses values that are orders of magnitude less \nprotective and underestimates the acute risk by a factor of 100 (see 2023 Memo ). \nEPA\u2019s proposal thus relies on a significant underestimate of the acute health \nhazards of the regulated facilities\u2019 emissions. It is both unlawful and arbitrary, as it \nis misalig ned with EPA\u2019s longstanding practice, an unsupported change with that \npractice, and a failure to apply the best available science.  \nIn addition to underestimating acute non-cancer health hazards, EPA is \nwillingly and knowingly exposing communities of color and low-income \ncommunities to increased and unnecessary harm from short-term HCl exposure. \nThe ERPG -1 is a guideline level calculated by the U.S. Department of Energy that \nrecognizes exposure to a chemical, like HCl, at this limit will lead to certain health \neffects.22 Conversely, the REL developed by OEHHA represents the reference \n \n19 EPA, Residual Risk Assessment for the Lime Manufacturing Source Category in Support of the 2019 \nRisk and Technology Review Proposed Rule  (May 2019) at 27.

Levels defined for \u201conce -\nin-a-lifetime, short -term exposures\u201d and \u201cemergency planning\u201d for \u201csingle \nexposures\u201d to chemical releases or accidents, are not appropriate tools to use to \nmeasure the accepta bility of acute risks over a lifetime from one or more potential \nexposures due to an industrial source\u2019s emissions.\n23124 The S cience Ad visory \nBoar d (\u201cSAB\u201d) has approved use of the RELs but not the EPRGs. As the SAB has \nexplained:  \nThe incorporation of the available California Reference Exposure Levels \n(RELs) for the assessment of acute effects is a conservative and acceptable \napproach to characterize acute risks . The Panel  has some concern with the use \nof the Acute Exposure Guidelines Limits (AEGLs) and Emergency Response \nPlanning  Guidelines (ERPGs ) AEGL -2 and ERPG-2 values should never be \nused in residual risk assessments because they represent levels that if \nexceeded could cause serious or irreversible health effects.24 \n \n23 84 Fed.

If it does not, it is a potentially \nsignificant uncertainty given the greater intake rate of children via inhalation and sensitivity to \ncarcinogens and other toxicants.\u201d). Available at: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-\n02/documents/epa -sab-10-007-unsigned.pdf .  \n \n \n20 \n \n \n \n The AEGL and ERPG numbers would be expected to underestimate risk. \nUsing these numbers is likely to discount or cloak the level of risk to the maximum \nexposed individual.  \nAs stated, EPA  has long recognized CalEPA RELs as authoritative and \nregularly uses them in risk assessments. It gives no reasoned scientific explanation for refusing to use this value as the best available reference dose here. It must use \nthe most up-to -date and best available scientific information on the risks and health \neffects of the HCl REL in its risk assessment. Doing so will lead to a recognition of \nincreased acute risk from lime kiln facilities\u2019 emissions \u2013 especially if EPA is \nproposing to allow a staggeringly high 300 tp y of HCl emissions based on its \napproach outlined in the 2023 Memo . \nFor c hronic non cancer risk  and where  child -specific reference values are \nunavailable, EPA must consult science on early exposure impacts and use an \nadditional default or uncertainty  factor.  \nThe increased susceptibility of children, while known to exist, has not been \nquantified for many toxic chemicals. Until EPA has child- specific or child- based \nreference values available for a given pollutant, EPA should apply a default or \nuncertainty factor  of at least 10 to account for increased risk from early- life \nexposures for non-cancer risk in this rulemaking and other risk assessments.  \nThis would be consistent with the NAS recommendation on the need for \nEPA to use default factors to account for greater risk,  with the science developed \nand considered by OEHHA, and with the 10X factor enacted by Congress in the \nFood Quality Protection Act.\n25 Specifically, as the SAB report explained:  \nCalifornia EPA/OEHHA has determined that inhalation dosimetry for \nchildren is sufficiently different from adults to warrant a full 10- fold intra -\nindividual pharmacokinetic uncertainty factor (i.e., an extra 3-fold PK uncertainty \nfor children relative to th e IRIS method) as a default approach. In setting non-\ncancer reference exposure levels (RELs), Cal EPA/OEHHA also considers that \n \n25 NAS, Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment (2009) at 190-93, 203. Available at : \nhttp://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12209.  \n21 \n \n \n \n children may be outliers in terms of chemical susceptibility and on a case -specific \nbasis adds a children\u2019s pharmacodynamic factor of 3 -fold, making the inhalation \nrisk for children as much as 10 times greater than adults.26 \nIn addition, Congress has recognized this science in its unanimous vote on \ntoxics legislation passed in 1996\u2014 the Food Quality Protection Act (\u201cFQPA\u201d) \u2014in \nwhich Congress found the need to use, and enacted, a tenfold Margin of Safety, or \n\u201c10X factor.\u201d Specifi cally, the Act provides that \u201can additional tenfold margin of \nsafety for the pesticide chemical residue and other sources of exposure shall be \napplied for infants and children to take into account potential pre - and post -natal \ntoxicity and completeness of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to \ninfants and children.\u201d27 Congress\u2019s recognition of the need to use this default factor \nprovides a model that EPA should consider and incorporate into its residual risk \nassessment.  \nIt would be appropriate and within EPA\u2019s authority under \u00a7 7412(f)(2) to \ndetermine that EPA must similarly use a children\u2019s tenfold margin of safety factor \nhere, to fulfill the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cmargin of safety\u201d requirement. 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7 \n7412(f)(2). In doing so, EPA may rely directly on the science itself, and also on the \nunanimous guidance from Congress, provided in the FQPA, that the existing \nevidence of increased harm requires significant action to protect children from \ntoxic  exposure.  \nFurther, the child- specific reference doses that OEHHA has created for some \npollutants provide support for the use of an additional tenfold margin of safety factor.\n28 EPA\u2019s current reference values for many pollutants are generally one \norder of magnitude less protective (i.e., larger) than the values that California has \n \n26 OEHHA, Technical Support Document for Cancer Potency Factors: Methodologies for derivation, \nlisting of available values, and adjustments to allow for early life stage exposures  (May 2009) at 3 -4, 50-\n51.

In a case concerning the national emission standards for pulp mill sources, the \ncourt held that EPA must set limits on uncontro lled hazardous air pollutant (\u201cHAP\u201d) emissions  \nwhen it conducts rulemakings under section 112(d )(6) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(6).  EPA \nthen reported that it was evaluating whether LEAN  affects the scope of its obligations under this \nCourt\u2019s order.  See, e.g., ECF No. 55.  \nSince then, EPA has concluded that LEAN  does not affect the scope of its obligations for \nthe risk and technology review of th e Iron and Steel Foundries category.2  But for the other five \nof the source categories\u2014Lime Manufacturing Plants, Miscellaneous Coating Manufacturing, \nRubber Tire Manufacturing, Plywood and Compos ite Wood Products, and Taconite Iron Ore \nProcessing3\u2014EPA has concluded that, in finalizing its  actions, it did not (or for the source \ncategory italicized in the list below, may not have) set all necessary emission limits for HAP \nemissions as part of its final rules as required by LEAN .

EPA reasonably iden tified health thresholds for acid \ngases that were equivalent to established human \nhealth values. ............................................................................. 29 \nC. EPA provided an ample margi n of safety.  ....................................... 36 \n1. Section 7412(d)(4) allows for a margin of safety to be \nprovided in the emission standard.  ........................................ 38 \n2. EPA\u2019s method of determining emission levels based \non identified health threshold values provided an \nample margin of safety.  ............................................................ 41 \n3. EPA\u2019s health -based standards provide an ample \nmargin of safety with respect to acute exposures.  ............... 43 \nII. EPA set MACT floors based on data reflecting emission levels and using the Upper Prediction Limit.  ......................................................... 45\n \nA. Introduction  .......................................................................................... 45 \nB. This Court has upheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a general matter. .................................................................................................... 48\n \nC. EPA adequately justified the application of the UPL \nmethodology to limited datasets. ....................................................... 49 \nD. EPA adequately supported its use of the UPL in the Brick/Clay Rule.  ................................................................................... 52\n \nIII. EPA\u2019s use of alternative emission limits for brick tunnel kilns was \nreasonable.  ......................................................................................................... 55 \nIV. EPA reasonably considered emissions information from synthetic \narea sources in determining major source MACT floors. ......................... 60 \nA. Synthetic area sources do not fit neatly within the section 7412(a) definition of either a major source or an area \nsource.  .................................................................................................... 61\n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 4 of 135\n \niv \n B. EPA\u2019s consideration of synthetic area source data is \nconsistent with the CAA and longstanding EPA policy. ............... 63 \nC. The CAA allows EPA to treat synthetic area sources as major or area sources depending on context.  .................................. 65\n \nV. The PM standards are consistent with the statute and rationally \ndeveloped, and EPA adequately responded to BIA\u2019s comments. ............ 67 \nA. EPA reasonably determined the MACT floors using the \nbest-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had \nemissions information.  ........................................................................ 67 \nB. The PM MACT standard reasonably represents the best-\nperforming 12 percent of sources.  .................................................... 71 \nC. EPA complied with procedural requir ements. ................................ 72 \nVI. The mercury standards for the brick industry are consistent with \nthe statute and congressional intent. ............................................................. 74 \nA. EPA appropriately determined the MACT floors for mercury and set standards at the floor levels. .................................. 74\n \nB. EPA\u2019s finding that sources could install controls or switch \nraw materials to meet the standards was not a basis for the \nstandards, but was reasonable.  ........................................................... 77 \nC. The CAA legislative history does not prohibit raw material \nsubstitution requirements for brick kilns. ......................................... 79 \nD. EPA\u2019s decision not to establish subcategories based on raw materials is rational and entitled to deference.................................. 81\n \nVII.  TCNA lacks standing to challenge the standards for the tile \nindustry and EPA\u2019s decision to list the major source category.  ............... 83 \nVIII.  EPA complied with the CAA in setting standards for major \nsources in the tile industry. ............................................................................. 84 \nA. EPA set standards for major sources in the tile industry consistent with CAA requirements. .................................................. 85\n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 5 of 135\n \nv \n B. EPA had authority to set major source standards for the \ntile industry even when no sources are subject to the \nstandards.  ............................................................................................... 87 \nC. EPA complied with notice and comment procedures in issuing the standards.  ........................................................................... 91\n \nIX. TCNA cannot now challenge EPA\u2019s listing of the major source \ncategory, and its challenge is without merit.  ................................................ 92 \nA. TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing  is untimely.  .................................... 92 \nB. EPA\u2019s listing of the major source category was proper. ................ 94 \n1. EPA adequately supported its basis for the listing.  ............. 94 \n2. TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the 2002 listing decision in the rulemaking for the 2003 \nRule.  ............................................................................................ 97\n \nX. EPA reasonably set the dioxin/furan standards and adequately responded to public comment.  ...................................................................... 98\n \nA. EPA reasonably determined  that Method 23 provided \nemissions information that could be used in determining MACT floors for ceramic tile sources.  ............................................. 98\n \nB. EPA p rovided notice and adequately responded to \ncomments regarding the dioxin/furan standards.  ........................ 101  \nXI. EPA\u2019s decision not to set standa rds for periods of malfunction is \nreasonable and entitled to deference. ......................................................... 103  \nXII.  The mercury and dioxin/furan standards for cerami c tile sources \ndo not require the use of activated carbon injection controls.  .............. 105  \nXIII.  EPA set the standards for sanitaryware sources in compliance \nwith the CAA. ................................................................................................ 107  \nA. EPA set the MACT floors as required by the CAA, based on what has been achieved. ............................................................. 109\n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 6 of 135\n \nvi \n B. EPA was not required to omit emissions data because a \nsource achieved emission reductions to comply with a \nvacated standard.  ............................................................................... 110  \nConclusion  ............................................................................................................................. 111  \n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 7 of 135\n_________________ \n* Authorities chiefly relied upon are marked with an asterisk . \nvii \n TABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \nCASES  \n \nBaltimore Gas & Elec.

Additional statutes are included in a separate addendum.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 18 of 135\n-4- \n STATEMENT OF THE CASE  \nA. Statutory Backgrou nd \nThe Brick/Clay Rule regulates the emissions of hazardous air pollutants \n(\u201cHAPs \u201d) pursuant to CAA section  112, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412.  As amended in 1990, \nsection 7412 directs EPA to regulate HAP emissions utilizing technology -based \nstandards.  Sierra Club v.  EPA , 353 F.3d 976, 979 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  In the 1990 \namendments, Congress designated 189 HAPs that it deemed to be hazardous and \ntherefore subject to regulation .  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(b)(1) .  Congress also required  \nEPA to identify the categories of sourc es of each HAP , id. \u00a7 7412(c),  and to set \nemission limits for each major stationary source , id. \u00a7 7412(d)(1) .  The statute defines \nmajor sources as those that emit or have the potential to emit considering controls \nmore than ten tons per year of any covere d HAP, or more than twenty -five tons per \nyear of any combination of HAPs.  Id.  \u00a7 7412(a)(1).   Sources that emit lower levels of \nHAPs are classified as \u201carea sources.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(2).    \nFor major sources, section 7412 requires EPA to establish national e mission \nstandards for listed  categories for both new and existing major sources .  These \nstandards are ordinarily  promulgated under section 7412(d) and \u201crequire the \nmaximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants subject to \nthis sec tion (including a prohibition on such emissions, where achievable)\u201d that the \nAdministrator determines is achievable based on existing technology, taking into consideration cost and other specific factors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  These emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 19 of 135\n-5- \n standards are referred to as \u201cmaximum achievable control technology\u201d or \u201cMACT\u201d \nstandards.  \nTo establish MACT standards, EPA follows a two -step process.   U.S. Sugar \nCorp. v. EPA , 830 F.3d 579, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  First, EPA establishes a \u201cMACT \nfloor,\u201d which is the absolute minimum level of emissions reductions covered sources \nmust achieve.  Mossville Envtl. Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1235 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  The MACT floor is based on what level of emissions limitation has been \nachieved within the source category .  For new sources, the MACT floor is \u201cthe \nemission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  The MACT floor for \nexisting sources in categories or subcategories with 30 or more sources is \u201cthe average \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing  12 percent of the existing sources \n(for which the Administrator has emission s information).\u201d  Id.  Where there are fewer \nthan 30 sources in a category of subcategory, the MACT floor is determined based on \nthe best-performing 5 sources.  Id.  Second, EPA has the discretion to set standards \nthat are more stringent  than the MACT floor (known as beyond -the-floor  standards) \nthat EPA determines are achievable \u201cta king into consideration the cost of achieving \nsuch emissions reduction, and any non -air quality health and environmental impacts \nand energy requirements.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7412(d)(2) ; see U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594-95.  \nEPA has extensive discretion to determine whether and  how to collect data and \nto decide how to identify and assess relevant data when  establishing emission USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 20 of 135\n-6- \n standards.

First, EPA \nhas discretion to promulgate \u201chealth -based\u201d emission limits  pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4) .  When section 7412 was first enacted, it required EPA to identify and \nregulate HAPs when they were found to \u201ccause, or contribute to, an increase in \nmortality or an increase in serious irreversible [ ] or incapacitating reversible [ ] \nillness.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 91 -604, \u00a7 4(a), 84 Stat. 1676, 1685 (1970), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) \n(1970).  Congre ss amended section 7412 in 1990 to direct the use of technology -based \nstandards b ecause the  prior  health -based standards proved ex ceedingly difficult to \ngenerate.  NRDC v. EPA, 529 F.3d 1077, 1079 (D.C. Cir. 2008).   \nBy contrast, section 7412(d)(4) provide s, \u201cWith respect to pollutants for which \na health threshold has been established, the Administrator may consider such \nthreshold level, with an ample margin of safety, when establishing emission standards USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 21 of 135\n-7- \n under this subsection.\u201d1  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4).  A s EPA explained, \u201cThis provision \nis intended to allow the EPA to establish emission standards other than technology -\nbased MACT standards, in cases where an alternative emission standard will still \nensure that the health threshold will not be exceeded, with  an ample margin of \nsafety.\u201d  NESHAP for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing; and \nNESHAP for Clay Ceramics Manufac turing; Proposed Rules, 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, \n75,638/3 (Dec. 18, 2014) .     \nSecond, if EPA determines that it is \u201cnot feasible\u201d  (as defined in section \n7412(h)(2))  to prescribe or enforce a numeric MACT standard, it may instead \npromulgate a design, equipment, work p ractice or operational standard.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(h).  These alternative standards are referred to as \u201cwork practice\u201d standards.    \nB. Regulatory  Background  \nEPA initially promulgated major source standards for brick and clay sources in \n2003.

Additionally, the Senate \nreport accompanying the 1990 amendments refers to the \u201cno observable effects level\u201d \nor \u201chealth -effects threshold\u201d as a level of exposure \u201cbelow which human exposure is \npresumably \u2018safe.\u2019\u201d  S.

Pursuant to a consent decree establishing deadlines \nfor the proposal and promulgation of standards, EPA issued a proposed rule on December 18, 2014, 79 Fed. Reg. 75,622, and promulgated the final Brick/Clay Rule \non October 26, 2015 .  80 Fed. Reg. 65,470.  \nFollowing publication of the Brick/Clay Rule, the Industry Petitioners each \nsubmitted petitions for administrative reconsideration.  On May 1 2, 2016, EPA \ndenied BIA and TCNA\u2019s  petitions , and granted in part and denied in part Kohler\u2019s \npetition.  81 Fed. Reg. 31,234  (May 18, 2016) . \nThe Brick/Clay Rule establishes emission limitations for two  major source \ncategories: brick and structural clay products manufacturing (the \u201cBrick Rule\u201d), and \nclay ceramics manufacturing (the \u201cClay Rule\u201d).  The brick and structural clay products \nsource category include s manufacturers of brick, clay pipe, roof tile, extru ded floor \nand wall tile, and other extruded, dimensional clay products.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,473/3.  The clay ceramics source category includes manufacturers of pressed tile and sanitaryware (e.g., toilets and sinks).  Id.  at 65,477/3.  The HAP s emitted by these  \nsources are primarily acid gases such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, and \nchlorine .  Id. at 65,473/2.  These sources also emit lesser amounts o f metals, including \nmercury , as well as  dioxin/furan.  Id .  Depending on duration and level of the  \nexposure, exposure to these chemicals can cause a variety of chronic and acute effects to the lungs, skin, central nervous system, digestive system, and kidneys.

I n \ngeneral, EPA  set three types of standards:  (1) numeric emission limitations at the \nMACT floor level; (2) health -based numeric emission limitations, pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4); and (3) non -numeric work practice standards.  The specific requirements \nchallenged in this case are discussed below in the sections of the argument that relate \nto each requirement.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nThis case presents challenges to the Brick/Clay Rule from two sides.  On the \none hand, Environmental Petitioners argue that the rule is not sufficiently protective \nof public health .  They challenge  health -based standards  set pursuant to section \n7412(d)(4), emission  limits calculated using an established statistical methodology, and \nthe flexibility afforded to industry to choose  standards that are  all calculated based on \nthe best-performing sources.  On the other hand, Industry Petitioners argue that the \nrule is overly stringent  for a litany of reasons largely relating to the data EPA \nconsidered in setting the standards for brick and  clay ceramics manufacturing \nfacilities.  Neither side is right.  \nA. Environmental Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n1. EPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for acid gases \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  The statute does not specify what it means when a \nhealth threshold \u201chas been established,\u201d and the concept of an \u201cestablished\u201d threshold is unique to section 7412(d)(4).  The identification of an \u201cestablished\u201d USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 24 of 135\n-10- \n health threshold in the same rulemaking in which EPA set health -based emission \nlimits is fully consistent with the plain language of the CAA.  EPA was not required to \naffirmatively conclude that the acid gases were not carcinogens before invoking section 7412(d)(4).  Petitioners\u2019 argument to the contrary misunderstands the nature of scientific uncertainty and how EPA must address such uncertainty when regulating.  \nAdditionally, EPA thoroughly analyzed the best available scientific information, \nincluding well -established, peer -reviewed toxicity databases, to determine that the  \nthree pollutants all had health thresholds.  Furthermore, EPA appropriately \nconsidered evidence and classification of carcinogenic risk in considering whether \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  had health thresholds .  EPA \nprovided adequate support for the specific health threshold levels it identified , and  \nEPA\u2019s technical judgments are entitled to the highest level of deference .  Finally, \nEPA\u2019s health -based standards include an \u201cample margin of safety\u201d as required by \nsection 7412(d)(4) because EPA  built a margin of safety into its process for translating \nthe acid gas health thresholds into emission limits by including several conservative assumptions in its emissions modeling.   This approach is consistent with the statute, \nand EPA fully explained why it expected this approach to result in exposure \nconcentrations well below the identified threshold values. \n2. EPA\u2019s use of the Upper Prediction Limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) methodology to \naccount for variability in calculating MACT floors for which the Agency had limited emissions data was reasonable.  This Court has affirmed EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 25 of 135\n-11- \n general matter, and EPA has sufficiently articulated a process for ensuring that the \napplication of the methodology to limited datasets still results in a reasonable estimate of the emissio ns achieved in practice by the best-performing sources in each \nsubcategory.  Moreover, EPA followed that process here, which resulted in adjustments to five of the MACT floors for brick kilns to more accurately account for \nthe distribution of data .  EPA ad equately explained the basis for all five of those \nadjustments.  Additionally, the upward adjustment of two of those floors was related to the addition of a raw material variability factor, which Petitioners do not challenge and which was not part of the U PL limited dataset analysis.  Furthermore  EPA may \nmake either upward or downward adjustments to its MACT floor calculations if it \ndetermines based on its limited dataset analysis that such adjustments are necessary. \n3. EPA\u2019s promulgation of alternative emi ssion limits for mercury and non -\nmercury metals for brick tunnel kilns was both consistent with the statute and \nreasonable.  Nothing in the plain language of section 7412(d) forbids EPA from promulgating multiple alternative MACT standards, so long as thos e standards require \nthe maximum degree of emission reduction and are based on the best-performing source or sources.  Because each floor was determined based on the best-performing \nsources according to the unit of measurement in which the floor is expresse d, the \nalternative floors are all based on the best-performing sources and satisfy the \nrequirements of section 7412(d)(3).  EPA\u2019s method for calculating the alternative \nlimits was therefore reasonable.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 26 of 135\n-12- \n B. Industry Petitioners\u2019 Claims  \n4. BIA\u2019s challenge to EPA\u2019s inclusion  of synthetic area source  data is \nbarred because BIA did not challenge the approach when EPA first used it in the \n2003 Rule.  In any case, EPA properly included emissions data from synthetic area \nsources, which would emit HAPs at major source levels but for their federally -\nenforceable controls, in determining the MACT floors for PM and mercury emission s \nfrom brick kilns.  EPA\u2019s use of such data is consistent with the statutory requirement \nto determine MACT floors based on e mission levels achieved by the \u201cbest \nperforming\u201d sources.  Inclusion of synthetic area sources in the MACT floor \ncalculations is consistent with the CAA, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA \npolicy.  \n5. EPA\u2019s determination to base the PM and non -mercu ry HAP metal \nstandards for brick industry sources on the top 12 percent of sources for which it had emissions data was consistent with the statute and reasonable.  EPA\u2019s other proposed approach, preferred by BIA, would have set standards based on the top 1 2 percent of \nthe total number of sources in the category.  If EPA had used that approach, it would \nhave needed to ensure that it had emissions data from all the best -performing sources \nin the category .  In the final rule, EPA  appropriately rejected BIA\u2019s p referred \napproach because EPA had no basis to conclude that it had data from all of the \nsources comprising the best-performing 12 percent of the entire industry . USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 27 of 135\n-13- \n 6. EPA appropriately set mercury standards for brick kilns at the MACT \nfloor levels based on w hat the best-performing sources actually achieved.  EPA did \nnot and could not consider other factors when calculating the MACT floor.  The \nstandards are not based on any specific control method, and leave sources with flexibility as to the methods for achi eving compliance.  Further, in setting the mercury \nstandards for sources in the brick industry, EPA reasonably declined to subcategorize \nbased on raw material content, and legislative history regarding EPA\u2019s ability to consider raw material switching is no t applicable here.   \n7. TCNA has not adequately demonstrated that it has standing to challenge \nthe standards and the major source category listing of tile industry sources.  In arguing that EPA impermissibly promulgated standards for a source category that includes no \nmajor sources, TCNA fails to allege that any of its members have suffered a cognizable injury.   \n8. EPA has authority to set standards for tile industry sources, and its \npromulgation of such standards was proper even in the absence of sources that would \nbe subject to the standards at the time of proposal or promulgation.  The tile industry sources are part of a source category listed pursuant to section 7412(c), and EPA is required to set standards for listed source categories.  EPA reasonably set major source standards for the tile industry because major sources existed in the industry when the category was listed, and because existing synthetic area sources and area sources could increase emissions to become subject to the major source standar ds. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 28 of 135\n-14- \n 9. The CAA provides for judicial review of EPA\u2019s listing of a major source \ncategory at the time standards are issued for the category.  Because EPA issued major \nsource standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2003, challenges to the li sting should have been brought at that time.  N o challenges to the listing were \nbrought within 60 days of the date the standard was issued, so TCNA\u2019s challenge to \nthe listing is now untimely, and the vacatur of the prior standards does not provide \nanother opportunity to challenge the listing.  In any case, EPA\u2019s listing of the category \nthat includes the tile industry was consistent with the CAA and adequately supported.  \n10. EPA\u2019s reliance on information from tile industry sources collected using \nan establi shed EPA test method, Method 23, to calculate MACT floors for \ndioxin/furan is consistent with the CAA\u2019s requirement that EPA calculate MACT floors based on the best -performing sources for which it has emissions information.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that Method 23 does not provide reliable \u201cemissions information\u201d \nis without merit.  Whether results from Method 23 are appropriate to use in setting \ndioxin/furan emission standards is a decision squarely within the A gency\u2019s expertise, \nand EPA reasonably concluded that Me thod 23 results are reliable and appropriately \nconsidered here.  \n11. EPA reasonably did not include data from periods of malfunction when \nestablishing standards for the tile industry.  To estimate emission levels of the best-performing sources, EPA relied on test data collected from those sources and accounted for variability in their actual operations.  Because malfunctions are USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 29 of 135\n-15- \n unpredictable events with unpredictable effects on emissions, EPA reasonably \ndetermined that information gathered during malfuncti ons was not useful in \ndetermining the MACT floors or otherwise setting standards.   \n12. EPA reasonably set standards for tile industry  mercury and dioxin/furan \nemissions based on the MACT floor.  TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA impermissibly \nconsidered the effect iveness of activated carbon injection controls in setting these \nstandards is misplaced.

EPA permissibly calculated the MACT floors for sanitaryware sources \nbased in part on data collected from a source using controls built to comply with the \nvacated 2003 Rule.  Kohler\u2019s argument that use of this data in setting standards was impermissible is without merit.  Vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not erase the actual \nemission reductions that sources had achieved.  Because the CAA requires that EPA \nbase the MACT floors on emission levels that have been achieved, and emissions data using controls demonstrated the emission levels achieved, EPA reasonably considered this data.   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nChallenged portions of the Brick/Clay Rule  may not be set aside unless they \nare \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nthe law.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(9).

Id . at 843 & n.11.  \nARGUMENT  \nI. EPA reasonably set health- based emission limits for a cid gases pursuant \nto section 7412(d)(4).  \nIn order for EPA to invoke section 7412(d)(4) and adopt a standard more \nlenient than the MACT floor for a pollutant, two requirements must be met:  (1) there \nmust be an established health thresh old; and (2) the health -based standards must \nprovide an ample margin of safety.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(4).  In the Brick/Clay  Rule, \nEPA reasonably promulgated health -based emission limits for three acid gases \n(hydrogen fluoride , hydrogen chloride , and chlorine ) for all existing and new brick \ntunnel k ilns and clay ceramics roller and tunnel kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,471, 65, 474, \n65,478.   \nFirst, before deciding to set health -based standards, EPA appropriately \ndetermined, based on the best available toxicity information, that each of the three pollutants ha s a health threshold.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  For all three pollutants, \nEPA :  (1) evaluated the carcinogenic and non-cancer health effects based on  existing \nscientific literature; (2) identified a health benchmark below which adverse ef fects are \nnot expected to occur; and (3) provided a rationale for their designation as threshold \npollutants.  See id. at 65,488/2-89/1; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41 .  EPA then assessed \nthe suitability of setting  a health -based standard specifically for brick and  clay USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 32 of 135\n-18- \n ceramics facilities , considering whether setting technology -based standards would \nresult in significant reductions in emissions of other pollutants, the potential for \nenvironmental impacts, the potential for cumulative adverse health effects in light of \nother co -located or nearby sources that also emit pollutants, and the availability of \nindustry -specific data to determine a standard .  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,495/3-98/3; 79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,641/2 -42/3 , 75,660/1 -61/1 .  Finally, in determining the appropriate  \nlevel of the health -based standards, EPA developed risk assessments and used \nmodeling to ensure that the established emission limit s would provide an ample \nmargin of safety, and that persons exposed to emissions of the pollutants would not experience the adverse health effects on which the health thresholds are based.  80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,498/3- 65,505/3; 79 Fed. Reg.  at 75,643/1 -44/2 .  This approach is \nconsistent with previous actions in which the Agency promulgated or considered promulgating health- based standards.

Reg. 54,970, 54 ,985/3-87/2 (Sept. \n9, 2010) . \nEnvironmental Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the hea lth-based standards  should be \nrejected.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation of the requirement that a health threshold \u201chas \nbeen established\u201d  misreads section 7412(d)(4) and misunderstands  how EPA \naddress es scientific uncertainty in the consideration of the potential health effects of a \npollutant.  It also disregards the fact that EPA set such standards after thoroughly \nanalyzing the best available s cientific information in a highly technical field , basing its \ndeterminations on rigorously vetted toxicity assessments of acid gases and adequately \nsupporting both its conclusion that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen \nfluoride had established health thresholds, and the specific threshold values it \nidentified for each pollutant.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 argument fails to account for the \nmethod EPA used to translate its identified health threshold values into emission \nlimitations that provide an ample m argin of safety.  \nA. EPA reasonably construed section 7412(d)(4) . \nSection 7412(d)(4) provides that EPA may establish health -based emission \nstandards \u201c[w]ith respect to pollutants for which a health threshold has been \nestablished.\u201d  The concept of a \u201chealth threshold [that] has been established\u201d is \nunique to section 7412(d)(4).  EPA does not make findings under the CAA regarding USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 34 of 135\n-20- \n the existence of a \u201chealth threshold\u201d outside the context of determining whether to \nset health -based emissi on limit s under this subsection.  Nor does the statute explain  \nwhat constitutes an \u201cestablished\u201d health threshold, or what EPA must do to determine that a health threshold \u201chas been established.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  \nAdditionally, by using the passi ve voice, the statute does not specify who  must \nestablish the health threshold.  Id.   Acco rdingly, the precise meaning of the phrase \n\u201chas been established\u201d is ambiguous.  \nHere, EPA reasonably interprets the phrase \u201chas been established\u201d as \nauthorizing EPA to identify a health threshold for a particular pollutant as part of a rulemaking establishing emission standards.  As the Agency explained , \u201c[i]n the \nabsence of such specificity in the statute, the EPA reads [section 7412(d)(4)] to authorize the EPA to se t health -based limits where, in the EPA\u2019s expert judgment, \nthere is a health threshold for the pollutant below which no adverse health effects are \nexpected to occur.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,491/3.  Applying this interpretation, EPA \nappropriately determined in the Brick/Clay  Rule that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  all had established health thresholds.  As further explained infra  in \nSection I.B, the analysis suppo rting the r ule includes an evaluation of the available and \nrelevant scientific evidence on the cancer risk and non -cancer health effects of each \npollutant.  See id. at 65,488-89; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41 .  That evidence included \nhuman health  values derived as part of several agenci es\u2019 toxicity assessments, and \nwhich EPA used in identifying  health threshold values for each pollutant.   See 79 Fed. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 35 of 135\n-21- \n Reg. at 75,639/3-40 .  EPA\u2019s approach of concluding in the Brick/Clay Rule that \nhydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  were thre shold pollutants based \non existing toxicity assessments was reasonable.  Nothing in section 7412(d)(4) \nprecludes EPA from determining that a health threshold has been established for pollutants as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -\nbased emission standard.  See Chevron , 467 U.S. at 842- 43 (holding that where a statute \nis \u201csilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\u201d the court must defer to the Agency\u2019s interpretation so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute\u201d). \nThe plain meaning of section 7412(d)(4) does not support Petitioners\u2019 position \nthat a health threshold must already have been established prior to the rulemaking that promulgates health -based standards .  Petitioners\u2019 references t o case  law \ninterpreting statutes using the present perfect tense are inapposite.  Environmenta l Br. \n34-35.  Neither a statute criminalizing a convicted felon\u2019s receipt of a firearm which \n\u201chas been shipped or transported in interstate . . . commerce,\u201d nor a  statute requiring \na person seeking damages for wrongful imprisonment to show that a conviction \u201chas been reversed or set aside,\u201d contemplates an agency taking further regulatory action.  Indeed, there would be no logical framework for the identified actio ns under the \nstatutes at issue in those other cases to be performed if they had not already taken place, and therefore it would be illogical to read either of those statutes as being predicated on an action that had not yet happened.  Here, however, the statutory USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 36 of 135\n-22- \n framework contemplates EPA exercising its discretion to take further action to set \nhealth -based standards after it determines that tho se pollutants have health \nthresholds.   \nFurthermore , the fact that an unenacted  version of section 7412(d)(4) would \nhave allowed EPA to set health -based standards where a health threshold \u201c can be  \nestablished,\u201d Environmental  Br. 35-36, does not demonstrate that EPA must make a \nthreshold determination prior to the rulemaking in which i t sets health -based \nstandards.  The change from \u201c can be  established\u201d to \u201chas been  established\u201d  is most \nreasonably  read to clarify that it is not sufficient for the establishment of a health \nthreshold to be hypothetically possible.  Instead, section 7412(d) (4) provides that a \nhealth threshold must actually be established for EPA to set health -based standards.   \nHere, EPA \u2019s threshold determination  did just that.  \nFinally, EPA reasonably interpreted section 7412(d) as not requiring consensus \non or the resolution of all uncertainty regarding a pollutant\u2019s health effects before \ndetermining  that a health threshold \u201chas been established\u201d for that pollutant.  As EPA \nexplained w ith respect to the identification of a health threshold value, \u201cthe phrase \n\u2018has been establi shed\u2019 [does not mean] that there is universal agreement on the health \nthreshold level.\u201d  80 Fed.

And nothing in the legislative \nhistory cited by Petitioners suggests otherwise .  The 1990 Senate report , see id. at 27, \nsimply indicates that health -based limits could be appropri ate \u201cwhere health \nthresholds are well -established . . . and the pollutant presents no risk of other adverse \nhealth effects, including cancer, for which no threshold can be established.\u201d  S.

In short, EPA reasonably interprets section 74 12(d)(4) as authorizing it \nto determine that a health threshold has been established as part of the same rulemaking process in which it promulgates a health -based emission  standard, and to \nidentify a health threshold where not all scientific uncertainty has been resolved w ith \nrespect to carcinogenicity.

EPA reasonably found that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride  were threshold pollutants  based on existing \nscientific evidence.  \nHere, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 argument, EPA applied its interpretation of \nsection 7412(d)(4) and reasonably found that a health threshold had \u201cbeen \nestablished\u201d for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride .  This finding, as USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 40 of 135\n-26- \n well as EPA\u2019s identi fication of a specific threshold value for each pollutant, is based \non a robust review of existing scientific literature, including consideration of toxicity \ndatabases that identify an exposure level below which adverse health effects are not expected to o ccur.  As part of its review of the health effects of hydrogen chloride , \nchlorine , and hydrogen fluoride , EPA stated that it considered each to be a threshold \npollutant based on a lack of affirmative carcinogenicity data and on the Agency\u2019s knowledge of ho w each pollutant reacts in the body and its likely mechanism of \naction.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,639-41.    \n1. EPA appropriately considered information regarding \ncarcinogenic risk.  \nConsistent with its position that it may not promulgate he alth-based emission \nstandards for carcinogenic pollutants, EPA began its health threshold assessment by \nevaluating the evidence of  carcinogenicity of hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride .  In doing so , EPA considered reviews conducted by seve ral \nexisting authoritative bodies.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,488/2.  None of those bodies had \nclassified hydrogen chloride , chlorine, or hydrogen fluoride  as carcinogens or \n\u201csuggestive of the potential to be carcinogenic,\u201d either individually or in combination.  \nId.  EPA found that there was an  absence of evidence of carcinogenic risk, and \ntherefore went on to consider whether a threshold  existed for each pollutant  below \nwhich other adverse health effects are not expected .

EPA provided an a mple margin of s afety . \nOnce EPA determined that hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and hydrogen fluoride  \nwere threshold pollutants, it prepared risk assessment s to determine a level of \nemissions that would ensure those health thresholds would not be exceeded, with an \nample marg in of safety, at any facility in the brick or clay source categor ies.

After identifying t he facility in each source category \nwith the highest modeled ambient chronic concentration\u2014i.e., the source whose \nemissions would generate exposure at the highest concentrations\u2014EPA then scaled up the emissions of that facility until the emission level would correspond to a non -\ncancer hazard quotient\n14 of one.

Because an emission level of 250 tons per y ear of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent per brick facility  would result in exposures at or below the threshold level \nat the facility  with the greatest potential for human exposure , EPA concluded that an \nemission level of 250 tons per year of hydrogen chloride -equivale nt per brick facility \nwould be unlikely to result in adverse chronic health effects at any facility in the source category, and would result in exposure concentration levels remaining below \nthe chronic health reference v alues at all facilities.

Environmental \nBr. 44.  This argument fails to acknowledge that the statute does not define how EPA \nmust include an ample margin of safety when setting health -based emission limits \npursuant to section 7412(d)(4).  Such a margin could be provided  at multiple points in \nthe process.  As Petitioners suggest, EPA could identify an exposure level that is \nbelow the established threshold level at which adverse health effects are not anticipated, and then run its modeling to determine  an emission  level that would \nresult in exposure concentrations at or below that lower health value.  But EPA may \nalso reasonably choose to base its emissions modeling on the established threshold, \nand build a sufficiently health -protective  model such that compliance with  the \nemission lim its should result in exposures below the established threshold level.  \nEither approach would  result in actual exposures that are below the threshold level, \nand either approach therefore provides an ample margin of safety.  EPA\u2019s use of the second approach here  was reasonable.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 7 5,642/3-43/ 1 (concluding \nthat \u201cit would be reasonable to set any [health -based] emission standard for a \npollutant with a health threshold at a level that at least assures that, for the sources in the controlled categ ory or subcategory, persons exposed to emissions of the pollutant \nwould not experience the adverse health effects on which the threshold is based\u201d).

EPA\u2019s method of determining  emission levels based on \nidentified health threshold values provided an ample margin \nof safety.  \nOnce EPA identified health threshold values for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , \nand hydrogen fluoride  below which adverse effects were not expected to occur, it \nmodelled each value  to determine  an emission level  that would result in exposure at or \nbelow the threshold level.

This conservative modeling approach \nprovides the \u201cample margin of safety\u201d required by  section 7412(d)(4). \nFirst, EPA based the limits  \u201con the single facility in the source category with \nthe worst-case combination of meteorology and distance to nearest residential receptor that leads to the highest ambient concentrations.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3;  \nBrick Risk Assessment at 6, JA490; Clay Risk Assessment at 3, JA 249.  Because the  \nsame level of emissions at all other facilities will result in lower ambient concentrations, for all but one facility in each source category, the model understates \nthe quantity of emissions that would  be sufficient to cause exposures at the threshol d \nlevel.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,501/3 (explainin g that chronic exposures at approximately \n90 percent of facilities are estimated to be half the threshold level or less).  \nAdditionally, EPA based the limit s on estimated ambient con centrations, which \nassume that people  at the exposure location at all times and do  not leave (to go to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 56 of 135\n-42- \n work or school, for i nstance ).  Id.   Because a  person is unlikely to breathe ambient air \naround the clock at an exposure  location, the model overestimates the average \nexposure to pollutants over time, and thus the risk of exposure at the threshold level, \nfor a person living at an exposure location.  \nThe ample margin of safety thus rests not on an assumption that sources\u2019 \nemissions will be lower than the permitted level, Environmental  Br. 46, but on the \nlikelihood that the conservative assumptions built into EPA\u2019s risk model ing approach \nwill mean that ambient chronic exposures for each facility remain below the threshold \nlevel even if the sources\u2019 emissions are at the maximum permitted level.  EPA \ntherefore reasonably concluded that this modeling approach, and the resultant emission levels that were determined , would ensure an ample margin of safety.   \nMoreover, as discussed su pra at 32-33, EPA\u2019s application of its own reference \nconcentration for hydrogen chloride  as the threshold level, rather than the different \nCalifornia EPA reference exposure level, was fully explained and reasonable, and \ntherefore does not undermine EPA\u2019s separate provision of an ample margin of safety through its modeling process .  Petitioners\u2019 argument that EPA\u2019s use of its own \nreference concentration negates the margin of safety provided by its modeling approach, Environmental Br. 46 -47, is therefore with out merit.

EPA\u2019s health -based standards provide an ample margin of \nsafety with respect to acute exposures.  \nPetitioners take issue  with EPA\u2019s assessment of acute exposure risk s for \nhydrogen fluoride , Environmental  Br. 41, but EPA properly assessed these risks . \nWhile EPA found that acute exposures at the selected emission limit  had the potential \nto be slightly above the California EPA acute reference exposure level for hydrogen \nfluoride at some  facilities (meaning that, at those facilities, the acute hazard quotient \nvalues had the potential to be greater than one), EPA nevertheless reasonably found \nthe potential for acute health effects at those facilities was low .  Brick Risk \nAssessment at 17, JA501; Clay Risk Assessment at 12, JA 258.  As  EPA  explained , \nexceeding the California EPA reference exposure level on which the acute hydrogen \nfluoride threshold was based does not automatically result in adverse health impacts.  \nBrick Risk Assessment at 13, JA497.  EPA considers a wider variety of reference \nvalues for its acute risk assessments than for its chronic risk assessments.  80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,503/2.  Here, E PA considered  a range of reference values even though it \ncalculated the hazard quotient fo r acute risk based on the California EPA acute \nreference exposure levels.  Id .  In particular, EPA explained  that applying the Acute \nExposure Guideline Level17 instead would result in a maximum offsite hazard \n                                                 \n17 Similar to the California EPA acute reference exposure levels, the Acute Exposure \nGuideline Level is a thresho ld limit for short -term exposu res.  See  Brick Risk \nAssessment at 13, JA 497.

Brick Risk \nAssessment at 17, JA 501; Clay Risk Assessment at 12, JA 258. \nAdditionally, EPA noted that the highest acute hazard quotient (based on the \nCalifornia EPA reference exposure level ) for hydrogen fluoride was two.  Id .  By \ncompa rison, EPA has found in section 7412(f) residual risk reviews that an emission \nstandard that would result in exposures with hazard quotients well above two  can still \nprovide an ample margin of safety.  See, e.g., NESHAP: Generic MACT Standards; and \nManufacture of Amino/Phenolic Resins, 79 Fed. Reg. 60,898, 60,909 (Oct. 8, 2014)  \n(finding acute hazard quotient value of ten based on reference exposure level value for \nformaldehyde).  Furthermore, EPA\u2019s acute exposure scenario included a  conservative  \nassumption that a person would be present at the location of maximum exposure for \nthe single worst hour of the year in terms of emission levels and meteorological \nconditions.  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501.   \nFinally, EPA found that it was unlikely that a facility would emit only hydrogen \nfluoride and not other acid gases.18  Brick Risk Assessment at 17, JA 501; Clay Risk \nAssessment at 12, JA 258.  The brick emission limits allow facilities to emit either 250 \ntons per year of hydrogen chloride , or 175 tons per year of hydrogen fluoride , or 1.9 \n                                                 \n18 This finding is supported by the test data EPA used to set the emission limits.  See \nCover Sheet, \u201cTest run data showing mercury emissions and emissions of hydrogen \nfluoride in relation to other gases\u201d (summarizin g EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0657 \nAppendix B (\u201cBrick Test Data Memo\u201d) and EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0290 -0293 \nAppendix B (\u201cClay Test Data Memo\u201d)), JA923.

EPA\u2019s acute exposure risk assessment for each \nparticular pollutant, however, assumed that a facility was emitting that  pollutant at the \nmaximum permitted level.  In reality, because all brick facilities emit a combination of acid gases and not just hydrogen fluoride, a facility would invariably exceed th e \nhydrogen chloride -equivalent emission limit based on emissions from a combination \nof acid gases before it reached the hydrogen fluoride limit.   See id.  Thus, u nder actual \nconditions, for a facility emitting 250 tons per year or less of hydrogen chloride -\nequivalent, the hydrogen fluoride  emissions will be less than those predicted by the \nmodel .  Accordingly, EPA reasonably considered acute health risks when setting a \nhealth -based emission limit for hydrogen fluoride . \nIn short,  Petitioners have presented no basis to conclude that EPA acted \ncontrary to law in identifying health thresholds for hydrogen chloride , chlorine , and \nhydrogen fluoride , and setting emission limits for these pollutants under s ection \n7412(d)(4) . \nII. EPA set MACT  floors based on data reflecting emission levels and using \nthe Upper Prediction Limit . \nA. Introduction  \nEnvironmental Petitioners challenge EPA\u2019s application of an established \nstatistical methodology known as the \u201cUpper Prediction Limit\u201d (\u201cUPL\u201d) to determine  \nMACT floors where EPA had limited emissions information to use in such USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 60 of 135\n-46- \n calculations .  Environmental  Br. 49-53.  As discussed further below, this Court has \nupheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL, and the record here demonstrates that EPA provided \nsufficient explanati on of why application of the UPL to limited datasets is appropriate.  \nAdditionally, EPA reasonably explained its application of the UPL in setting MACT \nfloors in the Brick/Clay Rule.  \nThe CAA  mandates that MACT floor  standards must be no less stringent than  \nthe level of emissi on control achieved by the best-controlled source or sources.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  While such standards also must ensure continuous regulation of the covered sources, id. \u00a7 7602(k), a s this Court has noted, \u201cno source emits any HAP  \nat a constant level; rather, HAP emission s fluctuate over time and for many reasons.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 598.  Most sources  \u201cdo not measure their HAP emission s at all \ntimes and under all conditions,\u201d id. , so EPA must establish MACT standards based on  \nlimited data, generally in the form of \u201cstack tests.\u201d\n19  Stack tests provide a \u201csnapshot\u201d \nof a facility\u2019s emissions in a limited set of conditions.  Id. \nEPA uses the UPL methodology \u201c[t]o compensate for the lack of adequate \nemissions data . . .

This Court included an extensive discussion of the \n                                                 \n19 A stack test typically consists of three separate sampling periods of several hours \neach conducted over one or more  days.  The concentration of tested pollutants is \ndetermined for each sampling event, and the result of the test is the average of the \nthree values for each pollutant.  E.g., 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.8445(e) (incorporating \n\u00a7 63.7(e)(3)).

T o \nestablish a MACT floor using the UPL, EPA :  (1) ranks all sources in each category \nbased on their stack -test data; (2) determines the HAP emission  level of the best-\nperforming source or sources pursuant to section 7412(d)(3); and (3) \u201capplies the \nUPL methodology to provide the cushion necessary to account for the expected peaks and valleys in HAP emissions not reflected in the three -run stack -test \n\u2018snapshots.\u2019\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d  at 598.  \n EPA used the UPL methodology to determine  22 of the brick and 27 of the \nclay MACT floors .

Petitioners challenge EP A\u2019s \napplication of the UPL methodology to limited datasets both in general, and specifically with respect to the emission limits it promulgated in the Brick/Clay Rule .  \nEnvironmental  Br. 49-53.  But EPA has provided ample support for its methodology . \nB. This Court has upheld EPA\u2019s use of the UPL as a general matter.  \nEPA\u2019s use of the UPL was challenged  in two recent cases in this Circuit.  In \nNational Association of Clean Water Agencies v. EPA  (\u201cNACWA \u201d), which involved \nEPA\u2019s MACT standards for sewage sludge incinerators, this Court remanded certain aspects of the rule for further explanation, including the question of how the UPL \nrepresents the MACT floor for new and existing units.  734 F.3d 1115, 1143  (D.C. \nCir. 2013).  The NACWA  Court did not invalidate the use of the UPL, but rather \nheld that EPA needed to more fully explain why the UPL was appropriate.  Id. at \n1151.  See also U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633.   \nEPA then provided such explanation in its re sponse to a remand of the record \nin challenges to rules for boilers and commercial and industrial solid waste \nincineration units.  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 633-34.  In that case, the Court found that \nEPA had \u201cdemonstrate[d] with substantial evidence . . . that the UPL \u2018allows a USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 63 of 135\n-49- \n reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units, \u2019\u201d which \nrepresented \u201creasoned decision making\u201d and accordingly was entitled to deference.  \nId. at 636.  The Court concluded that \u201cthe UPL \u2018reflect[s] a reasona ble estimate of the \nemission s achieved in practice by the best- performing sources,\u2019\u201d and upheld EPA\u2019s \ngeneral use of the methodology.  Id. at 639 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 871-72).  \nC. EPA adequately justified the a pplication of the UPL m ethodology \nto limited datasets.  \nThe Court\u2019s opinion in U.S. Sugar  expressly left open the question of whether \nthe UPL is an appropriate statistical method for small datasets.  830 F.3d at 633  n.25.  \nEPA addressed that issue in this Rule in a pair of memoranda setting f orth its general \napproach for applying the UPL to limited datasets, and explaining how that approach was followed in determining  the brick and clay MACT floors.  See Approach for \nApplying the Upper Prediction Limit to Limited Datasets (Sept. 24, 2015), EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2013 -0291- 0661 (\u201cBrick Limited Datasets Memo\u201d) and EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290-0295 (\u201cClay Limited Datasets Memo\u201d)  JA857, 370.   \nAs EPA explained, d etermining the distribution of data is an important \ncomponent of the UPL approa ch, and EPA uses well-established tests of kurtosis and \nskewness\n20 to determine distribution .  Limited Datasets Memos at 1 -2, JA 370-371, \n                                                 \n20 The kurtosis statistic cha racterizes the degree of peakedness or flatness of a given \ndata distribution in comparison to a normal distribution.  The skewness statistic \ncharacterizes the degree of asymmetry of a given data distributio n.  Brick MACT \nFloor Memo at 3 -4, JA 817-818.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 64 of 135\n-50- \n 857-858.  Previously, EPA  used a kurtosis equation that required at least four values \nin a dataset.  Id.   In further reviewing the applic ation of th e UPL to limited datasets, \nhowever, EPA identified another kurtosis estimating equation that provides a \nmeaningful result with as few as three values.  Id .  This equation enables EPA to apply \nthe UPL to smaller datasets. \nAs EPA further explained , to determine sample size thresholds above which \nuse of the UPL does not require further scrutiny, or  below which use of the UPL is \nnot appropriate, EPA considers how a diminishing sample size affects the t-score, \nwhich is \u201ca value that estimates the unce rtainty and variability for a certain confidence \nlevel associated with a specific number of data points.\u201d  Brick Limited Datasets Memo \nat 2, JA858.  As the sample size decreases, t he t-score \u2014and the uncerta inty of the \naverage that is calculated from the av ailable data points \u2014increases.  Id.  As the sample \nsize increases, the relative changes in the t-score become less dramatic, particularly \nonce the sample size is equal to or greater than three .  Id. at 3 (Figure  1, Table 1), 5, \nJA859, 861 .  EPA thus determined that it may be appropriate to use the  UPL to \ndevelop emission limits based on as few as  three datapoints.21  Id. at 2, JA858. \nEven with the use of the alternate kurtosis equation, EPA \u201crecognize[d] that \nthe use of the UPL approach for limited dat asets introduces some amount of \n                                                 \n21 Additionally, because emission tests typicall y include three test runs, the MACT \nfloor dataset size is typically a multiple of three.

Accordingly, EPA  identified addition al steps \u201cto ensure that the level of \nthe MACT standards is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  For MACT floors  based on between three  \nand six test runs, EPA conducts additional, case -by-case evaluation \u201cto ensure that the \nuncertainty associated with a limited dataset does not cause the calculated emission \nlimit to be so high that it does not reflect the average pe rformance of the units upon \nwhich the limit is based after accounting for variability the emissions of those units.\u201d  \nSee id. at 6-8, JA375-377, 862- 864.  That evaluation include s some combination of \n\u201cconfirming that the data distribution was selected correctly; after confirming the data distribution, ensuring that we use the most appropriate UPL equation; and, as necessary, comparing UPL equation components for the individual unit  upon which a \nnew source floor is based with those of the units in the existing source floor to determine if our identification of the best unit is reasonable.\u201d  Id .  EPA thus \nreasonably explained why MACT floors derived from limited datasets can be consid ered adequate, and identified a sufficient case -by-case evaluation process to \nensure that individual MACT floors based on limited datasets are reasonable.   \nPetitioners\u2019 contention  that NACWA precludes the application of the UPL to \nlimited datasets, Enviro nmental Br. 49,  is incorrect.  The NACWA  Court simply \ndirected EPA to explain \u201cwhy the [UPL] could still be considered accurate given a small dataset,\u201d 734 F. 3d at 1144- 45.  EPA in this rule has done exactly what the \nNACWA Court directed , and what the U.S. Sugar  Court found EPA  had successfully USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 66 of 135\n-52- \n done on a more general level:  EPA demonstrated that the UPL can, when applied to \nlimited datasets, still allow a reasonable inference as to the emissions achieved by the \nbest-performing sources , and EPA has adopted a sound analytical process to follow \nwhen it uses the UPL to  determine  a MACT floor and based on limited data.  \nEPA \u201c\u2018typically has wide latitude in determining the extent of data -gathering \nnecessary to solve a problem,\u2019\u201d and is entit led to  deference \u201cwhen it determines how \nbest to meet the technical challenges in its area of expertise.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131).  Here, EPA\u2019s analysis of  the acceptable \nlevel of uncertainty in the determination  of M ACT floors, and its development of a \nprocess to further evaluate and address that uncertainty, are  reasonable .  See \nNACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville, 370 F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club v. EPA, 167 \nF.3d 658, 661-63 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (stating that the CAA doe s not specify how EPA \nmust determine what the best-performing units are achieving, and EPA has \nconsiderable discretion in doing so as long as its methodology is reasonable).     \nD. EPA adequately supported its use of the UPL in the Brick/ Clay \nRule. \nThe Limite d Datasets Memos apply EPA\u2019s evaluative process to brick and clay \nMACT floors involving  limited datasets.  See Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, \nJA864-866; Clay Limited Datasets Memo at 8, JA377 .  EPA had limited datasets for \n18 pollutants and subcatego ries in the brick source category, and for 21 pollutants and \nsubcategories in the clay cera mics source category .  Brick Limited Datasets Memo at USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 67 of 135\n-53- \n 11 (Table 4), JA867; Clay Limited Datasets Memo  at 9 (Table  2), JA378.  For e ach \ndataset, EPA explained that it \u201censur[ed] that [it] selected the data distribution that \nbest re presents each dataset;\u201d \u201censur[ ed] that the correct equation for the distribution \nwas then applied to the data;\u201d and \u201ccompar[ed] individual components of each limited \ndataset to determine if the standards based on limited datasets reasonably represent \nthe performance of the units included in the dataset.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 8 , \nJA377, 864 .  EPA determi ned based on its evaluation that no changes to its usual  \nfloor calculation procedure w ere warranted for the clay MACT floors, and that \nchanges were warranted for five of the brick floors.  Id . \nEnvironmental Petitioners contend that EPA did not adequately explain the \nadjustments made  to five brick floor calculations .  Environmental Br. 52.  They \nfurther assert that EPA improperly made upward adjustments to two of the five \nfloors.  Id.  Both of these arguments fail.  First, for each of the five adjusted MACT \nfloors, the Limited Datasets Memo includes an explanation of how and why EPA made these adjustments.  Se e Brick Limited Datasets Memo at 8 -10, JA 864-866.   \nFor the new source MACT floor for PM (in pounds per ton) from large tunnel \nkilns, EPA found that it could not accurately determine a representative distribution from the best-performing source because there were only two test runs for that kiln, \nso EPA selected the next best-performing unit and recalculated the UPL based on that unit.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 8, JA864.  For the existing  source MACT \nfloor for PM (in grams per dry square cubic foot) from small tunnel kilns, EPA found USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 68 of 135\n-54- \n that the distribution of the dataset would be better represented by a lognormal \ntemplate , and determined  the MACT floor using that template .  Id. at 8-9, JA864-865.   \nSee also  UPL Memo at 7 -9, JA 509-511 (describing characteristics of normal and \nlognormal distribution curves).   Similarly, for the new source MACT floors for \nmercury (in pounds per ton, micrograms per dry standard cubic meter, and pounds \nper hour), EPA explained that the datasets would be better represented by a \nlognormal distribution and template.  Brick Limited Datasets Memo  at 9-10, JA 865-\n866.  EPA therefore adequately explained the basis for the adjustments. \nFurthermore, EPA reasonably adjusted u pward the floors (in pounds per ton \nand pounds per hour) for mercury emissions from large new kilns.  In arguing that \nEPA\u2019s decision to adjust those floors was arbitrary, Environmental  Br. 52-53, \nPetitioners first fail to note that EPA also made changes to  the mercury floors outside \nthe limited dataset analysis.  As discussed infra  at 75-76 , EPA added a variability factor \nto account for variations in the mercury content of raw material used at brick kilns.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2-3 .  Because the addition of a raw material variability factor \u2014\nwhich Environmental Petitioners do not challenge \u2014introduces more uncertainty into \nthe UPL calculations, it results  in a higher MACT floor.

Therefore, the upward \nadjustment of the mercury floors was due at least in  part to the uncontested USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 69 of 135\n-55- \n application of a raw material variability factor .  In any event, w hile the steps outlined \nin the Limited Datasets Memos aim to ensure  that a MACT floor determined  by \napplying the UPL methodology to a limited dataset is not unreason ably high, see Brick \nLimited Dataset s Memo at 6, JA 862, the  specific facts in the record of a given rule \nmay lead to an adjustment either downward or upward to ensure the floor more \naccurately represents the average of the best -performing source or sources .   \nIn short, EPA articulated a reasonable method for ensuring that MACT floors \nbased on limited datasets \u201creflect the average performance of the units upon which \nthe limit is based.\u201d  Limited Datasets Memos at 6 , JA375, 862.  EPA then applied that \nmethod in the case of the brick and clay MACT floors  based on limited datasets.  \nEPA demonstrated that its application of the UPL methodology to limited datasets is reasonable both in general and as applied to the Brick/Clay Rule .  EPA has therefore \nmet the requirement identified in NACWA and U.S. Sugar  that it \u201cdemonstrate [s] \nwith substantial evidence\u2014not mere assertions\u2014that the UPL allows a reasonable inference as to the performance of the top 12 percent of units.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at \n636 (quoting NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1131) (internal quotation marks omitted ).   \nIII. EPA\u2019s use of a lternative emission limits for b rick tunnel kilns was \nreasonable. \nIn the Brick Rule, rather than promulgating a single numeric MACT limit for \neach subcateg ory, EPA gave operators of new and existing tunnel kilns a choice of \nthree alternative emission limits, each expressed in a different unit of measurement, USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 70 of 135\n-56- \n for both mercury and non-mercury metals.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474.   To comply with \nthe mercury emissio n limits , sources could choose one of three  numeric emission \nlimits expressed as mass of pollutant emitted per ton of bricks produced, pounds per \nhour, or concentration (micrograms per dry standard cubic meter).  Id.  at 65,530, \nTable 1.  For non-mercury metals, EPA set a pounds per hour emission limit, and also \nprovided options for limiting PM as a surrogate22 with limits in pounds per ton or \ngrains per dry standard cubic foot.  Id .  This approach \u201c provides  flexibility for the \nregulated c ommunity by allowing a regulated source to choose any control technology \nor technique to meet the emission limits, rather than requiring each unit to use a \nprescribed control method that may not be appropriate in each case.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,633/2.    \nConsistent with the statutory directive to determine  MACT floors based on the \n\u201cbest performing\u201d sources \u201cfor which [ EPA ] has emissions information,\u201d  EPA \ndetermined  the MACT floor for each of the alternative limits using a slightly different \npool of sources .  EPA found  that the composition of the group of top -ranked sources \nvaried depending on the unit of measurement that was appl ied.  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/2.  EPA therefore ranked sources  so th at \u201c[e]ach floor [would be] based on \nthe best performing units for that unit of measurement.\u201d  Id .  In other words, as EPA \n                                                 \n22 The use of PM as a surrogate for HAP metals in the context of setting MACT \nfloors  is well -established and not at issue here.  Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 982 \n(quoting Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v. EPA , 233 F.3d 625, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 71 of 135\n-57- \n explained, \u201cthe concentration floor is based on the ranking of concentration data, and \nthe [pounds -per-hour]  floor is based on the ranking of the [pounds -per-hour]  data.\u201d  \nId.   \nEPA\u2019s decision to set alternative emission limits for mercury and non -mercury \nmetals for brick tunnel kilns is consistent with the statutory language.  Section 7412(d) \ndirects EPA to promulgate \u201c[e]missions standards . . . [that] require the maximum degree  of reduction in emissions,\u201d and requires those standards to be based on the \nbest-performing source or sources for which the Administrator has emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  Nothing in the plain language of the \nstatute forecloses the promulgation of multiple, alternative standards that each independently meets  those requirements.  \nMoreover, the statute does not specify what unit of measurement EPA must \nuse in expressing  its emission  limitations or identifying the best- performing source or \nsources to determine  the MACT floor.   Congress therefore left to EPA\u2019s discretion \nthe selection of an appropriate metric by which to measure sources\u2019 performance.  Inherent in that discretion is the abi lity to set alternative floors based on differ ent \nmetrics.\n23  EPA has considerable discretion in its determination  of MACT floors as \nlong as its methodology is reasonable.  NACWA , 734 F.3d at 1141-42; Mossville; 370 \n                                                 \n23 EPA has promulgated alternative emission limits pursuant to section 7412(d) in \nseveral other rules.  See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. pt. 63, Subpt. UUU \u00a7 63.1564(a)(1) (setting \nalternative limitations for metal HAP emissions from catalytic cracking units at \npetroleum refineries); Subpt. DDDDD \u00a7 63.7500(a), Tables 1 and 2 (major boilers).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 72 of 135\n-58- \n F.3d at 1241; Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 661- 63.  EPA\u2019s decision to promulgate \nalternativ e limits is therefore reviewable under Chevron  step two, and is entitled to \ndeference so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d  \nChevron , 467 U.S. at 842 -43. \nPetitioners argue that because the alternative floors were not based on identical \nemission levels, they are not equal, and that two of the floors are therefore less stringent.  Environmental Br. 54.  Petitioners further claim that it is impossible for \nmultiple sources or groups of sources to all be the \u201cbest\u201d performing sou rce or group \nof sources unless their emission levels are identical.  Id.  This argument is rooted in an \noverly simplistic conception of when emission limits may be said to be based on the \u201cbest\u201d performing source s.  The alternative floors each reflect the \u201cbest\u201d performing \nsource s because each is based on the best-performing sources for the unit of \nmeasurement for that floor.    \nSimilarly, Petitioners\u2019 contention that the use of alternative floors allows \nregulated facilities to choose the least stringent floor with which to comply, see Environmental  Br. 53, mistakenly assumes that one of the alternative floors is the \nmost or least stringent.  Instead, the relative stringency of the alternative floors is an \napples -to-oranges comparison.  By way of analogy, in a comparison of the most \ntalented professional football, basketball, and baseball players, it would be impossible  \nto determin e which is the best-performing  athlete without establishing  a metric for \nevaluating overall athletic performance.  Furthermore, it is impossible to say that the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 73 of 135\n-59- \n football player who scores the most touchdowns is a better or worse -performing  \nathlete than the  basketball player who makes  the most three -point shots, or than the \nbaseball player who hits  the most home runs, because those metrics are not directly \ncomparable.   Given this, it would be reasonable to set a standard for athleticism that \nrequires an athl ete to have either scored at least a certain number of touchdowns, \nmake  at least a certain number of three -point shots, or hit at least a certain number of \nhome runs.  That athletes could  pick the metric that they are most capable of meeting \nwould  not make  the approach unreasonable.  \nThe same is true when measuring the performance of brick kilns.  For instance, \na smaller facility with fewer kilns may emit a smaller volume of pollutants overall as \nmeasured in pounds per hour, but it may emit more pollutants p er ton of bricks \nproduced.  By contrast, a larger kiln may emit more pollutants as measured in pounds per hour, but may run more efficiently and therefore have lower emissions as \nmeasured in pounds per ton of bricks produced.  See, e.g. , Brick MACT Floor M emo \nat A-2 (Table A-1), A-5 (Table A-2), A-9 (Table A-5), JA830, 833, 837 (showing Kiln \n514 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per ton of PM, Kiln 508 as \nthe top -ranking large kiln as measured by grams of PM per dry square cubic foot, and \nKiln 526 as the top -ranking large kiln as measured by pounds per hour of non-\nmercury metal HAP).     \nEPA\u2019s decision to set al ternative emission  limitations for brick tunnel kilns was \ntherefore a reasonable exercise of it s discretion under section 7412(d ).  Having USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 74 of 135\n-60- \n decided  to promulgate alternative limits, EPA\u2019s method for calculating those limits \nwas also reasonable.  EPA explained this method and its rationale for calculating each \nMACT floor based on its own unit of measure dataset.  S ee 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2, \n65,507/1.  In  basing each alterna tive limit on the best- performing sources for that \nunit of measurement, EPA satisfied the requirement of section 7412(d)(3 ) to base its \nMACT floors on the best -performing sou rces in a category.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  \nFinally, Petitioners suggest that it was unnecessary for EPA to promulgate \nalternative limits because EPA could have divid ed tunnel kilns into further \nsubcategories (i.e., beyond two subcategories based on size), and then set a single \nemission  limit for each subcategory .  Environmental Br. 55.  While EPA has the \ndiscretion to  further subcategoriz e and considered whether to d o so, see 79 Fed. Reg. \nat 75,634/1, the discretion to identify subcategories does not foreclose the Agency\u2019s \nauthority  to promulgate alternative emission  limits  where appropriate .  \nIV. EPA reasonably considered emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determining major source MACT floors.  \nSynthetic area sources (or \u201csynthetic minor sources\u201d) are sources that have the \npotential to emit HAPs in excess of the major  source threshold, but whose emissions \nhave been controlled to the extent that they fall below  the threshold due to federally -\nenforceable emission  controls.  See Brick Rule Summary of Public Comments and \nResponses at 46 -47 (Sept. 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0685 (\u201cBrick Rule \nRTC\u201d) , JA907-908; 2003 Rule, 68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2.  Consistent with EPA\u2019s USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 75 of 135\n-61- \n interpretation of section 7412, EPA treats such sources as area  sources for \ndeterm ining applicability of emission  standards, but as major sources for other \npurposes.  Because the statute directs EPA to identify the level of control achieved in \npractice by the best-performing  sources, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3), EPA consid ers \nemissions information from synthetic area sources when determining  which sources \nare the best-performing  sources.  EPA continued to use this approach in setting the \nbrick industry standards.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A-6, A-9, A -10 to A -12 \n(Tabl es A-1, A-2, A -5, A-7, A -8, A -9), JA830 -834, 837, 838-840. \nBIA challenges EPA\u2019s inclusion of emissions information from synthetic area \nsources in determin ing existing source MACT floors for the PM and mercury \nstandards for large kilns.  Industry Br. 20.  Because BIA did not challenge this  same \napproach to determining MACT floors in the 2003 Rule, see  68 Fed. Reg. at 26,697/2 -\n98/3, its argument is time-barred.  Med . Waste Inst.  v. EPA, 645 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. \nCir. 2011)  (holding that a challenge to EPA\u2019s approach not raised within sixty days of \nEPA\u2019s first use of the approach was barred).  The argument also fails because EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation of the ambiguous statutory text is reasonable and consistent with the statute\u2019s structure, congressional intent, and longstanding EPA policy.   \nA. Syntheti c area sources do not fit neatly within the s ection 74 12(a) \ndefinition of either a major s ource or an area s ource . \nSection 7412(a) of the CAA defines a \u201cmajor source\u201d based on a thresh old \namount of HAPs that a source \u201cemits or has the potential to emit considering USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 76 of 135\n-62- \n controls.\u201d   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1).  A source with the potential to emit at or above the \nthreshold is a major source, and any other source is an area source.  Id. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) , \n(a)(2).  Major sources are treated differently from area sources in certain respects.  See, \ne.g., id. \u00a7 7412(c) (requiring EPA to list all categories of major sources, but only \nrequiring EPA to list area sources in certain circumstances); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(5) (allowing \nEPA to set standards for area sources based on \u201cgenerally available control technologies or management practices\u201d rather than the MACT floor). \nDetermining whether a source should be considered as a major source or an \narea source is not always straightforward.  The definition of a major source includes the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering controls .\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(a)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  This phrase is not defined in the statute, and its meaning is ambiguous.  Although this phrase would not matter for determining whether most sources are major sources, it does matter for synthetic area sources.  EPA interprets the phrase to \nshow that consideration of a source\u2019s potential to emit before and after controls is relevant to how the source is treated (in both setting and applying standards).  See 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,509 /1-2.  This interpretation is entitled to considerable deference, as it \nis a permissible construction of a complex statute that is within the agency\u2019s area of expertise.  See Chevr on, 467 U.S. at 842- 43; United States v. Mead Corp. , 533 U.S. 218, \n227-31 (2001).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 77 of 135\n-63- \n B. EPA\u2019s consideration of synthetic area source data is consistent \nwith the CAA and longstanding EPA policy.  \n Section 7412 expresses Congress\u2019s intent that emission standards fo r existing \nmajor sources are based on levels that are actually achieved by the \u201cbest performing\u201d \nexisting sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A) (basing  standards on the \u201cbest \nperforming 12 percent of the existing sources\u201d); id.  \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B) (basing  standards \non the \u201cbest performing 5 sources\u201d).  Consistent with this intent, EPA includes \nemission s information from synthetic area sources when determin ing the MACT floor \nfor existing major sources.  Synthetic area sources demonstrate \u201cemission limitation [s] \nachieved\u201d by major sources because their controls have effectively reduced their \nemissions  from above major source threshold levels to below major source threshold \nlevels .  It would be contrary to congressional intent to exclude synthetic area sources \nfrom the MACT floor determination simply because their controls decreased their \nemissions enough to fall below the major  source threshold level.  This approach is \nalso consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history.  See Floor Statement of Sen. \nDurenber ger, 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 870 (clarifying  the intent that EPA collect \u201cdata \non all of the better -performing sources within each category\u201d and ensure that EPA \n\u201cdoes not miss any sources that have superior levels of emission s control\u201d ).  EPA\u2019s \ninclusion of synthetic area sources for p urposes of determining the MACT floor \nensures \u201csources that have superior levels of  emission s control \u201d are considered. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 78 of 135\n-64- \n Further, section 7412(d)(3) expressly exclude s from the MACT floor \ncalculation  those sources that meet the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nof section 7501 .  See 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A), 7501(3).  The express exclusion of \nthose  sources demonstrates that Congress considered the issue of which sources \nshould be excluded from the MACT floor determination , but did not conclude that \nsynthetic area sources should be excluded .  Instead, Congress provided EPA the \nflexibility to include synthetic area sources.  \nEPA has consistently treated synthetic area sources as area sources when \ndetermining the applicability of particular requirements, but as major sources for \ndetermin ing major source MACT floors.  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.2 (defining \u201cpotential to \nemit\u201d as the \u201cmaximum capacity of a stationary source to emit a pollutant under its \nphysical and operational design,\u201d and a limitation on the capacity of the source \u201cshall be treated as part of its design if the limitation or the effect it would have on \nemissions is federally enforceable\u201d \u2014i.e. , a synthetic area source would not be subject \nto major source stan dards); Memorandum from John S. Seitz to EPA Regions, \nPotential to Emit for MACT Standards \u2013  Guidance on Timing Issues (May 16, 1995) , \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0569  (\u201cSeitz Memo\u201d), JA 441-450 (addressing  when a \nmajor source can become a synthetic area source).  And EPA has included synthetic \narea sources in MACT floor calculations in prior rulemakings.  E.g., NESHAP for \nMunicipal Solid Waste Landfills , 68 Fed. Reg. 2227, 2 232/2 (Jan. 16, 2003); NESHAP USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 79 of 135\n-65- \n for Polyvinyl Chloride and Copolymers  Production , 77 Fed. Reg. 22,848, 22,876/3-\n78/1 (Apr. 17, 2012) . \nC. The CAA allows EPA to treat synthetic area sources as major or \narea sources depending on context.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires exclusion of synthetic area \nsources wrongly assumes that synthetic area sources can never be considered major \nsources for any purpose.  BIA argues that EPA may only use sources \u201cin the \ncategory\u201d to determine the MACT floor for that category , thus excluding synthetic \narea source data from consideration , since they are n ot subject to major source \nstandards .  Industry Br. 19-20 .  BIA\u2019s argument is based on the assumption that a \nsource must be treated as either a major or an area source for every purpose .  As \nexplained above, that is not how EPA interprets the statutory def inition of \u201cmajor \nsource\u201d in the context of  synthetic area sources.   \nContrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, EPA does not \u201cadmit[  ] that synthetic [area] \nsources are not major sources.\u201d  Industry Br. 21.24  EPA has stated that although \nsynthetic area sources \u201care not subject to the requirements imposed on major sources \n. . . that does not equate to a conclusion that they are no longer major sources in any respect.\u201d  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  EPA considers synthetic area sources to be major \n                                                 \n24 That the standards\u2019 appl ication is \u201climited to brick plants located at a major source ,\u201d \nIndustry Br. 20,  demonstrates only that EPA does not subject synthetic area sources \nto major source standards , which is consistent with EPA\u2019s position.  See 40 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 63.8385.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 80 of 135\n-66- \n sources in certain respects, such as when EPA identifies the best -performing major \nsources as part of the MACT floor determination.  Id.   Thus, eve n if, as BIA \ncontends, section 74 12(d)(3)(A) requires that all sources considered in determining the \nMACT floor be \u201cin the category,\u201d see Industry Br. 21, synthetic area sources are  major \nsources that are \u201cin the category\u201d for the purpose of determining the MACT floor.  \nFurther, this does not mean that section 74 12(d)(3)(A)\u2019s phrase  \u201cin the category  or \nsubcategory \u201d is meaningless.  The phra se limits the sources that EPA considers.  Here, \nfor example, when setting standards for brick sources, EPA only look ed at the \nemission limitations achieved by brick sources\u2014not the emission limitations achieved \nby tile sources or other non-brick sources.  The phrase also means that brick sources \nthat are true area sources are excluded from major source MACT floor \ndeterminations.  \nNowhere does the statute require that once a source is treated as \u201cin\u201d (or out \nof) a category , it must be treated that way for all purposes.  BIA\u2019s argument that \nCongress excluded sources meeting the l owest achievable emission rate  requirements \nfrom section 7412(d)(3) because they are \u201cin\u201d the major source category while synthetic area sources are excluded by definition because they are not \u201cin\u201d the major source category only continues to rely on BIA\u2019s preferred interpretation of the statute.  See Industry Br. 22.  EPA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cpotential to emit considering \ncontrols\u201d  is consistent with Congress\u2019s direction to use the \u201cbest performing\u201d sources \nin the category or subcategory and is entitled to deference.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 81 of 135\n-67- \n Further, this Court has acknowledged that synthetic area sources should not \nnecessarily be treated the same as area sources.  See U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at  650 \n(finding that EPA had not adequately explained \u201cwhy the rationale it used to exempt \nnatural area sources from Title V could be identically applied to synthetic area  \nsources.\u201d).  And for a major source included in more tha n one source category, if the \nsource\u2019s compliance with major  source standards for one source category results in \nthe source\u2019s potential to emit falling below the major  source threshold, EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation allows the source to be treated as a synthetic ar ea source for later-\npromulgated standards for a different source category .  See Seitz Memo at 9-10, \nJA449-450.   This Court should therefore defer to EPA\u2019s reasonable and longstanding \ntreatment of synthetic area sources as major sources for the purpose of determin ing \nthe MACT floor.  \nV. The PM standards are consistent with the statute and rationally \ndeveloped, and EPA adequately responded to BIA\u2019s comments.  \nA. EPA reasonably determined the MACT floor s using the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for which it ha d emissions \ninformation. \nFor a category with 30 or more sources, section 7412(d)(3)(A) requires EPA to \ndetermine  the existing  source MACT floor by calculating  the \u201caverage emission \nlimitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sourc es (for which \nthe Administrator has emissions information).\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(A) (emphasis added).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 82 of 135\n-68- \n This is precisely what EPA did in determining the MACT floor for PM from existing \nbrick sources.  \nEPA  initially identified two potential approaches for determining the existing \nsource MACT floor for PM emissions from brick sources, and sought information from the brick industry to use in determin ing MACT floors.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,635/1-2, 75,649/1- 2.  The first p roposed approach was based on the possibility \nthat EPA could identify the best- performing 12 percent of sources in the entire \ncategory, in which case the MACT floors could be based on a larger number of \nsources.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,506/3; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1- 2.  At the time of the \nproposal, EPA assumed that kilns with fabric filters would be the best-performing sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1; Analysis of Potential Subcategories for BSCP \nTunnel Kilns at 6 -7 (Nov. 6, 2014)  EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0122 , JA530-531.  \nEPA explained that if  kilns with fabric filters were the best-performing sources and if  \nit had information from all fabric filter -controlled sources, then EPA could identify \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1-2; 80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,506/ 2-3.  Because the category contained 225 sources at the time of \nproposal and 220 when the standards were issued, the best-performing 12 percent of the category would be represented by 27 sources.  See 79 Fed. Reg. at 7 5,635/2 ; Brick \nMACT Floor Memo at 10 (Table  1), JA 824 (showing 122 large kilns and 98 small \nkilns).  EPA expressed concern, however, that although kilns with fabric filters were statistically better -performing as a group, emissions data reflected that some  sources USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 83 of 135\n-69- \n with other or no controls performed better  than some of the fabric filter -controlled \nkilns.  7 9 Fed. Reg. at 75,635/1 -2.  EPA therefore requested information on the \nreliability of data showing low emissions from kilns without fabric filters.  Id. \nThe second proposed approach was simply to set  emission limits \u201cbased on the \ntop 12 percent of the data available in each of the kiln size sub categories.\u201d  Id. at \n75,635 n.1; see id. at 75,649/1-2; Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) \nFloor Analysi s for Brick and Structural Clay Products at 11-12, A -5 to A -8 (T ables  A-\n4, A-5) (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0291 -0119 (\u201cProposed Brick MACT \nFloor Memo\u201d ), JA522-523, 525-528.25  EPA proposed  emission  limits under this \napproach, Proposed Brick MACT Floor Memo at 12  (Tables 5, 6), JA523, and  \nrequested comment on  the method of generating th ose limits , and on whether the \navailable-data approach should be used instead of the fabric filter -based approach.  79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,649/2.  EPA noted that the reliabili ty of the data from non-fabric \n                                                 \n25 To determine  MACT floors based on the total number of sources in the category \n(with 30 or more sources), EPA would need sufficient information about all sources \nin the category to conclude that it had emissions data from the best-performing 12 \npercent of sources.  For  example, if a category has 100 sources, EPA could base the \nMACT floors on 12 sources only if it has information to show that those 12 sources are the best performers in the category.  Alternatively, EPA could determine the floor \nbased on 12 percent of the  sources for which it has emissions information.  For \nexample, if EPA has information for only 50 of 100 sources, the MACT floor could be calculated based on the best- performing 6 sources for which EPA has data, even \nthough some of the sources fo r which EP A does not have data  might be better -\nperforming sources.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 84 of 135\n-70- \n filter-controlled  kilns was \u201ca key factor\u201d in determining which approach is \nappropriate.  Id.  at 75,635 n.1.  \nBetween the proposal and the final rule,  EPA did not receive information \nsufficient to exp lain why some non-fabric filter -controlled sources emitted at levels as \nlow as or lower than some sources with fabric filter controls .  80 Fed. Reg. at \n65,485/1.  EPA therefore had no basis for excluding data from those lower -emitting \nnon-fabric filter -controlled sources and thus c ould no longer assume that fabric filter -\ncontrolled sources were the best performers.  Additionally, EPA d id not have \nemissions data from all the fabric filter -controlled sources, so even if it could have \nexcluded the lower emitting data, it would not nece ssarily have had information from \nthe best-performing 12 percent of sources in the category .  Id. at 65,484 /3-85/1.  For \nthese reasons, EPA determined  the final PM MACT floors using the best -performing \n12 percent of sources for which it had emissions information.   Id. at 65,485/1-2 .  EPA \nfinalized the standards using subcategories based on kiln size, consistent with the \nsecond  approach it had proposed.  Id.   Because the data showed that some non -fabric \nfilter kilns had lower emissions th an fabric filter -controlled kilns, EPA reasonably \nconcluded that it could not assume that fabric filter -controlled kilns were the best-\nperforming kilns, and EPA appropriately set the PM MACT floors based on the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources for whi ch it had emissions information.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 85 of 135\n-71- \n B. The PM MACT standard reasonably represents the best -\nperforming 12 percent of sources.  \nBIA\u2019s contention that the PM MACT floors are unrepresentative because the \ndata were skewed toward the best-performing sources, Industry  Br. 24-28, is not \nsupported by the record .  See White Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1247 (considering similar \nallegations, and finding that  \u201casser tions of a biased or irrational data collection \nprocess are not  supported by a review of the record \u201d).  EPA relied on  data from a \nvariety of sources, including responses to EPA surveys, test data compiled during the \n2003 rulemaking, and additional data from Petitioner BIA.

And BIA could have provided emissions data \nfrom more sources.  Although data from fabric filter -controlled sources were a large \nportion of EPA\u2019s dataset, these sources were not consistently the best performers.  \nIndee d, EPA included data from non -fabric filter -controlled sources to determin e the \nMACT floors.  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 to A -9, JA 830-837, (showing non-\nfabric filter -controlled sources ranked in the top twelve percent).  And like the data at \nissue in Wh ite Stallion , 748 F.3d at 1248, here, some of the best-performing sources for \nPM were worse -performing for mercury.  Compare  Brick MACT Floor Memo at A -2 \nto A-6, JA 830-834 with id. at A-10 to A -12, JA838-840.  \nEPA has provided ample support and justificatio n for its  method , and had no \nreason to believe that the lower non -fabric filter emissions data were inaccurate.  See USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 86 of 135\n-72- \n 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,484/3 -85/1 ; 79 Fed. Reg. at 75,635 /1-2, 75,649/1-2 .  EPA \nproceeded cautiously in questioning the data that were  counter to its expectations and \nrequesting comment, and the  industry responses did not show that the data were \nunreliable.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,48 4/3-8 5/1.  Moreover, contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion \nthat \u201c EPA made no attempt to reconcile the suspicious data ,\u201d Industry Br. 25, EPA \ncontacted kiln owners to request information concerning the test results, requested \ninput from BIA, and undertook a technical review of the data.  See, e.g., Telephone \nContact Summary for Lee Brick (May 2015) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013 -0291- 0650 , JA781; \nTelephone Contact Summary for Boral Industries (May 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0291- 0649, JA780; Email from Sharon Nizich to Terry Schimmel and Susan Miller, \nRe: More Information Needed on Kiln Test Reports for Uncontrolled Kilns at 4 -6 \n(June 8, 2015 at 10:42 am), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0607, JA785-787; Brick Test \nData Memo at 6 , JA814.  Therefore, EPA reasonably relied on these  data in \ndetermin ing the PM MACT floors.  \nC. EPA complied with procedural requirements.  \nBIA\u2019s argument that EPA failed to respond to information it provided  \nconcerning  lower emissions data  for some non-fabric filter -controlled sources, \nIndustry Br. 28-29 , lacks merit .  EPA is only required to respond to significant \ncomments.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(6)(B); Covad Commc\u2019ns Co. v. FCC, 450 F.3d 528, 550 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) .  Here, the sole \u201ccomment\u201d that BIA cites is an email providing  a list \nof kilns with short notes on factors BIA suspected might affect the test data, without USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 87 of 135\n-73- \n explaining why the factors might cause the data to be unrepresentative of the kiln\u2019s \nemissions.  See Email from Susan Miller to Sharon Nizich, DLA/Uncontrolled Kilns \n(June 25, 2015 at 2:43 pm ), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291 -0614, JA788 (listing notes  \nsuch as \u201c[i]nitial MACT compliance test- suspect all new limestone\u201d).  This  can hardly \nbe considered a legally significant comment.  Indeed, BIA\u2019s explanation of these \nfactors in its b rief provides more explanation than was provided  in its email.  See \nIndustry Br. 28 -29.   \nFurthermore, the information in BIA\u2019s email would not have chan ged how \nEPA determin ed the MACT floors.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(d)(8) (\u201cIn reviewing alleged \nprocedural errors, the court may invalidate the rule only if the errors were so serious \nand related to matters of such central relevance to the rule that there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the rule would have been significantly changed if such errors had not been made.\u201d).  In the absence of additional evidence, BIA\u2019s identification of factors \nthat it suspected might  potentially indicate unrepresentative emission s data would not \nhave provided sufficient justification for EPA to exclude data from low -emitting \nsources without fabric filter controls.  BIA did not show that the non -fabric filter data \nwere unreliable, nor did it provide additional data so that EPA could conclude that it \nhad information from all best -performing sources.  Without such evidence, EPA \ncould not have justified using data from 12 percent of sources in the industry \u2014i.e., \nfrom more than the top-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had emi ssions \ndata\u2014in finalizing the fabric filter-based proposed standards.  80 Fed.

The mercury standards for the brick industry are consistent with the \nstatute and congressional intent.  \nContrary to BIA\u2019s  argument, Industry Br. 29 -39, EPA determin ed the mercu ry \nMACT floor for the brick industry exactly as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  \nLegislative history cited by  BIA does not negate what the statute and case law require.  \nFurther, EPA reasonably found that sources can comply with the standard through means other than switching raw materials (although no such finding is necessary).  \nFinally, EPA reasonably declined to establish subcategories based on raw materials.  \nA. EPA appropriately determined the MACT floors for mercury and \nset standards at the floor leve ls. \nAs this Court has emphasized, \u201cEPA may not deviate from section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s \nrequirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve.\u201d  Sierra  Club, \n479 F.3d at 880 (quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  \u201cWhen setting the MACT floor, [  ] EPA considers only the performance of \nthe cleanest sources in a category . . . it does not take into account other factors, \nincluding the cost of putting a source in line with its better -performing counterparts.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 594.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 89 of 135\n-75- \n In its decision vacating the 2003 Rule, this Court held that where EPA had \nfound that raw material content has an appreciable effect on HAP emissions from \nbrick kilns, EPA could not set MACT floors based solely on the use of p ollution \ncontrol technology.  Sierra Club,  479 F.3d at 882- 83.  The Court stated that a purely \ntechnology -based approach would satisfy the CAA \u201cif pollution control technology \nwere the only  factor determining emission levels of that HAP.\u201d  Id.  at 882 (quoting \nCement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 863) (internal quotation marks and further citations omitted).  \nBy contrast, if factors other than technology \u201cinfluence a source\u2019s performance, it is not sufficient that EPA consider [ ] sources using only . . . MACT controls.\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 864- 65).     \nHere, EPA determined the mercury MACT floors for brick kilns by calculating \nthe emissions from the best-performing 12 percent of sources for which it had \nemissions information, as required by section 7412(d)(3)(A).  EPA set standards for \ntwo subcategories, small kilns and large kilns, and allowed kilns to use one of three \nalternative measurements to comply.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 /2-3, Table 4.  EPA set \nthe mercury standards under section 7412(d)(3) at the MACT floor level because it \nfound that more stringent limits (whi ch would have to be based on a beyond -the-floor  \nanalysis under section 7412(d)(2)) were \u201cnot reasonable relative to the level of emission reduction achieved\u201d due to the costs of addition al controls.  79 Fed. Reg. at \n75,638/2.  Further, because mercury emissions result from the mercury content in the raw clay used, and mercury content varies by the location where clay is quarried, EPA USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 90 of 135\n-76- \n developed a variability factor for mercury content in r aw clay and incorporated it into \nthe UPL equation used to determine the MACT floors.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,485/2 -3.  \nAs a result, the final mercury standards are less stringent than the proposed standards.  \nCompare  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,628  Table 4 (proposing m ercury standards for large kilns as \n0.00002 2 pounds per ton) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,474 Table 4 (finalizing mercury \nstandards for large kilns as 0.000041 pounds per ton).  EPA  also noted that the \nmercury standards provide flexibility for sources by \u201callow ing a regulated source to \nchoose any control technology or technique to meet the emission limits, rather than \nrequiring each unit to use a prescribed control method.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,633/2.  \nSee also Brick Rule RTC at 27, JA 901 (\u201c[I]t is up to each fac ility to determine the type \nof emission control that works best for their particular situation.\u201d).  \nBIA\u2019s arguments that the mercury standards are invalid proceed from the \nincorrect assumption that EPA must ensure that all sources are able to achieve MACT \nfloor-based standards.  But that is not what the CAA requires.  Rather, this Court has \nclarified that the MACT floors must be set regardless of whether all sources can achieve them.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (stating that section 7412(d)(3) \u201climits the \nscope of the word \u2018achievable\u2019 in section 7412(d)(2),\u201d and  that \u201cEPA may not deviate \nfrom section 7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually achieve by claiming that floors must be achievable by all sources using MACT technology\u201d);  Nat\u2019l Lime Ass\u2019n v.

EPA\u2019s finding that sources could install controls or switch raw \nmaterials to meet the standards  was not a basis for the standards , \nbut was reasonable.  \nIn its response to comments, EPA noted that activated -carbon injection \ncontrol devices were an available compliance option for brick kilns.  See Brick Rule \nRTC at 13, 26-27, JA 894, 900-901.  BIA argues that because no sources in the \nindustry use such  devices to reduce mercury emissions, and EPA has not shown that \nthey would be effective, the controls are not a realistic compliance option, so that \nEPA has effectively required brick facilities to switch raw materials.  Industry Br. 30 -\n32. \nIn fact, the record fully supports EPA\u2019s statements concerning the \neffectiveness of activated carbon injection controls.  See  Brick Rule RTC at 26-27, \nJA900-901 (noting proven ef fectiveness of controls in similar industries and noting \nlack of evidence that controls would interfere with operation of brick sources).  See also Methodology and Assumptions Used to Estimate the Model Costs and Impacts of \nBSCP Air Pollution Control Devices for the Final Rule at 7 -9 (Sept. 24, 2015) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013- 0291- 0662  (\u201cBrick Cost Memo\u201d), JA 870-872 (consider ing activated \ncarbon injection controls in the cost analysis).  Activated carbon injection controls \nhave proven effective in controlling mercur y emissions from similar sources in other \nindustries.  Brick Rule RTC  at 13, JA 894.  EPA has used its technical expertise to USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 92 of 135\n-78- \n reasonably determine that such controls would be effective for the brick industry as \nwell.  That technical determination is entitle d to considerable deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.  Therefore, there is no basis for BIA\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe \nonly available means of controlling mercury emissions is raw material substitution.\u201d  Industry Br. 32.   \nIn any event, as explained supra in Section VI.A , EPA does not need to \ndetermine how sources can meet the MACT floor, let alone whether  sources can meet \nthe MACT floor at all.  BIA\u2019s statement that EPA asserts that brick plants could meet the standard by \u201c switching to clay with lower mercury content,\u201d Industry Br. 30, \nwrongfully assumes that EPA\u2019s assertion  could have any bearing on the level s at \nwhich MACT floor -based standards were set.  While EPA noted in its cost analysis \nthat \u201cif significant amounts of  mercury are found at one location onsite, material \nfound at another onsite location with a lower mercury content could be used,\u201d Brick \nCost Memo at 9, JA 872, EPA  explained elsewhere that it was  \u201cnot requiring the use \nof offsite raw materials in this rule. \u201d  Brick Rule RTC  at 26, JA 900.  Stating that \nsources may be able to comply if they switched raw materials does not amount to a requirement.  But even if EPA had found that switching clays was the only way sources could comply with the standard s, that find ing would not have allowed EPA to \nset less stringent standard s, because the standard s are already at the MACT floor level.  \nSee Sierra  Club, 479 F.3d at 880.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 93 of 135\n-79- \n C. The CAA legislative history do es not prohibit raw material \nsubstitution requirements for brick kil ns. \nLargely ignoring the statutory text and this Court\u2019s decision in Sierra Club, BIA \nargues that legislative history indicates that EPA may not require raw materials \nsubstitution for brick kilns.  See Industry Br. 33 -34.  As explained supra in Sections \nVI.A and VI.B, this argument proceeds from the flawed premises that EPA must \nexplain how all sources could meet the standards, and that all sources must meet the \nstandards through raw material substitution.  E ven if BIA\u2019s premises were correct, \nthis argument would lack merit.   \nTo support its position, BIA c ites an explanatory statement in a Conference \nReport for the 1990 Amendments, which states that in setting standards for categories \nof sources \u201cengaged in mining, extraction, beneficiation, and pr ocessing of \nnonferrous ores, concentrates, minerals, metals, and related in -process materials, the \nAdministrator shall not consider the substitution of, or other changes in, metal - or \nmineral -bearing raw materials that are used as feedstocks or materials i nputs, or metal - \nor mineral -bearing materials processed or derived from such feedstock s or materials.\u201d  \nIndustry Br. 33 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 101 -952 at 339 , 1 1990 Legis. Hist. at 1989).  \nHowever, the clear language of the statute requires EPA to determi ne the MACT \nfloor by estimating the emissions actually achieved by the best-performing existing sources.  Cement Kiln , 255 F.3d at 861 (\u201cEPA may not deviate from section \n7412(d)(3)\u2019s requirement that floors reflect what the best performers actually USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 94 of 135\n-80- \n achieve.  . . .\u201d).  The statutory language provides no allowance to set the MACT floor \nat a less stringent level if some sources would otherwise need to switch raw materials.  \nIndeed, Sierra Club held that MACT floors could not be justified by the Agency\u2019s \n\u201cconcer n that floors based on clean clay would be unachievable.\u201d  479 F.3d at 883.   \nBIA\u2019s request for en banc  review of Sierra Club or an Irons  footnote , Industry Br. \n38, is unjustified because no  prior conflicting  holdings are a t issue .  See Irons v. \nDiamond, 6 70 F.2d 265, 267-68, n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1981) .  As in the cases BIA cites, \n\u201c[t]his case does not present the very rare situation where the legislative history  of a \nstatute is more probative of congressional intent than the plain text.\u201d  Consumer Elecs. \nAss\u2019n v.

Here, interpreting \nthe legislative history to deviate from the plain text of the CAA\u2019s MACT floor \nrequirements would uproot not only the holding of Sierra Club , but also this Court\u2019s \nlongstan ding precedent that MACT floors must be set at the lowest levels achieved.   \nFinally, while the directive of the statute is clear, the legislative history is not.

EPA\u2019s decision not to establish subcategories based on raw \nmaterials is rational and entitled to deference.  \nAt the time of proposal, EPA stated that it would consider subcategorizing \nbased on the mercury content of raw materials if data were provided showing \u201ca \ncorrelation between raw material content and mercury emissions and . . . sharp \ndisparities in raw material mercury content that readily differentiate among types of \nsources.\u201d  79 Fed.

During the \nrulemaking , however, although EPA assumed a correlation existed between the \nmercury content of clay and mercury emissions, EPA did not  receive sufficient data to \nsubcategorize on that basis.

Because emissions data \n                                                 \n26 If the legislative history were to have any controlling weight, it would only be to \nlimit EPA\u2019s considerations when setting beyond -the-floor standards for specific \nindustries.  This is because sect ion 7412(d)(2) allows EPA to consider ways in which \nsources could reduce emissions, such as materials substitution, in setting standards \nmore stringent than MACT floors.  And contrary to BIA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 34, \nthis interpretation is consistent w ith how EPA considered legislative history in a prior \nrulemaking.  See Sierra Club v. EPA , 353 F.3d at 988 (discussing EPA\u2019s decision not to \nset beyond- the-floor standards for copper smelters based in part on legislative history).  \n USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 96 of 135\n-82- \n were collected years prior to data on raw material content,27 and because the mercury \ncontent of clay varies even within a quarry, see Mercury Con tent of Oklahoma and \nOhio Shale Deposits Supplying the Brick Industry at 6, 9 (T ables 1,  2) (Sept. 23, \n2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291-0659, JA805, 808, EPA could not demonstrate a \ncorrelation between the mercury content in the raw materials and mercury emissi ons.  \nAccordingly, EPA reasonably concluded that it could not justify subcategorization \nbased on raw material content.  \nBIA contends that subcategorization would \u201censure that MACT floors are truly \n\u2018achievable\u2019\u201d and would \u201cavoid the need for raw material sub stitution.\u201d  Industry Br. \n37.  As stated above, h owever, there is no requirement that MACT floors be \nachievable by all sources,28 nor has EPA required material substitution.  EPA \nexplained what data it would need to justify subcategories, but then  determine d that it \ndid not receive enough information to justify that approach.  EPA\u2019s decision not to \nsubcategorize based on raw materials is rational and entitled to deference.  See White \nStallion , 748 F.3d at 1233.   \n                                                 \n27 While the most recent mercury emission test was conducted in 2011, see Cover \nSheet, \u201cTest run data showing mercury emissions and emissions of hydrogen fluoride \nin relation to other gases,\u201d JA924, the samples for raw material content were collected \nbetween 2013 and 2015.  See Attachment to Email from Susan Miller to Sharon \nNizich, Green Brick Mercury Data (May 4, 2015), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0291-0618, \nSJA1 -5.  \n \n28 Indeed, setting a standard based on what is \u201cachievable\u201d rather than on what is \n\u201cachieved\u201d was one of the bases for the vac atur of the 2003 Rule.  Sierra Club, 479 \nF.3d at 880. USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 97 of 135\n-83- \n VII. TCNA lacks standing to challenge the standards for the tile industry \nand EPA\u2019s decision to list the major source category.  \nTCNA challenges EPA\u2019s promulgation of standards on the grounds that they \nare for a subcategory that did not include any major sources at the time of \npromulgation, and arg ues that the hypothetical possibility of a major source arising in \nthe industry in the future is not enough to support EPA\u2019s promulgation of the \nstandards.  Industry Br. 41.  As discussed in greater detail infra  at 85-88, although \nmajor sources in the tile  industry existed when EPA listed the category and were \nsubject to the 2003 Rule, no major sources in the tile industry were subject to the Clay Rule at the time it was promulgated.   \nIn challenging EPA\u2019s major source standards for the tile industry and EP A\u2019s \nlisting of the major source category including the tile industry, TCNA bears the \nburden of proving that it has Article III standing.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 \nU.S. 555 , 561 (1992) .  TCNA must show that its members suffer an injury caused by \nthe promulgation of the standards that could likely be redressed by this Court.  Id.  at \n560-61; Sierra v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 738-40  (1972) .  And TCNA must prove that \ninjury is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.   \nTCNA incorrectly claims that \u201c [t]he legitimacy of the promulgation is dependent \nupon TCNA\u2019s right to judicial review challenging it.\u201d  Industry Br. 18.  Rather, TCNA \nmust affirmatively establish its right to seek judicial review before its arguments may be considered.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at  560.   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 98 of 135\n-84- \n To demonstrate that it satisfies Article III requirements, TCNA must show that \nat least one of its members likely would be subject to the standards.  But any such \ndemonstration would undermine TCNA\u2019s argument t hat EPA inappropriately \npromulgated the standards.  Accordingly, TCNA has not identified a single member who is or will be harmed, and has failed to allege specific facts sufficient to prove it has standing.  See Industry Br. 17 -18, Attachment B; Lujan v. Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n , 497 \nU.S. 871, 888 (1990) (holding \u201cconclusory allegations\u201d are insufficient to establish standing); Sierra Club v. EPA , 292 F.3d 895, 899 ( D.C. Cir. 2002) (finding petitioner\u2019s \nburden to prove standing is the same as a plaintiff\u2019s bur den at summary judgment).  If \nTCNA views the \u201chypothetical possibility\u201d of a future source becoming subject to the standards as so remote as to preclude EPA from promulgating the standards, then TCNA lacks standing to challenge them.  And as discussed infr a in Sections VIII -XII, \nTCNA\u2019s arguments fail on the merits even if this Court determines that TCNA has \nstanding.  \nVIII.  EPA complied with the CAA in setting standards for major sources in \nthe tile industry.  \nTCNA argues that the CAA requires that EPA issue standa rds under section \n7412(d)  only if it finds that there are major sources in the category that would be \nsubject to the standard s.  Industry Br. 39 -44.  This argument lack s merit.  EPA \nappropriately determined that there were major sources in the listed categ ory at the \ntime of listing, consistent with CAA requirements.  A fter EPA properly listed the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 99 of 135\n-85- \n category, the CAA required it to promulgate major source standards for sources in \nthat category.  Accordingly, EPA properly issued standards for the tile industry.     \nA. EPA set standards for major sources in the tile industry consistent \nwith CAA requirements.  \nIn the 1990 CAA amendments, Congress requ ired EPA to publish an initial \n\u201clist of all categories . . . of major sources,\u201d and certain area sources of HAPs.  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1), (c)(3).  To supplement its initial list, EPA \u201cmay at any time list \nadditional categories . . . according to the same criteria for listing\u201d applicable under section 7412(c)(1) and (c)(3).  Id. \u00a7 7412(c)(3).   For major sources, the only \u201c criter [ion] \nfor listin g\u201d is that the category contain  major sources of HAPs.  See id.  Any person \ncan petition to have a category deleted  from the list, and EPA may delete a category \nonly if it makes certain determinations specified in section 7412(c)(9).  Id.  \u00a7 7412(c)(9); \nNew Jersey v. EPA, 517 F.3d 574, 578-79, 582 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  Otherwise, once a category is listed, EPA must establi sh emission standards for major sources in that \ncategory.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (c)(5), (d)(1), (e)(1); see Sierra Club v. EPA, 850 F. \nSupp. 2d 300, 304 (D.D.C. 2012).   \nEPA promulgated  the Clay Rule consistent with those requirements.  In 1992, \nEPA pub lished the initial list of source categories, which included a \u201cclay products \nmanufacturing\u201d source category.  Notice of Initial List of Categories of Sources under Section 112(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments, 57 Fed. Reg.  31,576, 31,591/3 \n(Table 1) (July 16, 1992).\n  In 2002, in addition to proposing standards, EPA provided USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 100 of 135\n-86- \n notice that it had replaced the clay products manufacturing source category on the \nsource category list with two source categories: brick and structural clay products manufacturing  and clay ceramics manufacturing.

Reg. 47,894, 47,896/2-3  (July 22, 2002) .\n29  The \u201cclay ceramics \nmanufacturing source category i nclude s those facilities that manufacture pressed floor \ntile, pressed wall tile, and other pressed tile; or sanitaryware.\u201d  Id.  at 47,913/3.  EPA \nfinalized clay ceramics standards in 2003, 68 Fed. Reg. 26,690, and existing major sources in the tile industr y were subject to the standards starting in 2006, until this \nCourt vacated the standards in 2007.  See 68 Fed. Reg. at 26,716/1; Sierra Club, 479 \nF.3d at 876. \nThe clay ceramics manufacturing category remained a listed source category \nnotwithstanding this Court\u2019s vacatur of the 2003 Rule , and therefore, EPA was still \nrequired to promulgate standards for major sources in the category.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(c)(2), (e)(1); See Sierra Club, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 304.  Accordingly, EPA properly \npromulgated standards for major tile industry sources in the Rule under review.   \n                                                 \n29 EPA had provided notice in 1999 that it anticipated reevaluating the clay products \nmanufacturing category and replacing it with four categories, including a clay ceramics \nmanufacturing category.

EPA had authority to set major source standards for the tile \nindustry even when no sources are subject to the standards.  \nBy August 27, 2014, just months before EPA re -proposed major source \nstandards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category, all sources in the tile industry \nthat would otherwise have been subject to the  standards had either closed or become \nsynthetic area sources.  See Email and Letter from Eric Astrachan to Peter Tsirigotis, \nTCNA Letter - No MACT Major Sources in Ceramic Tile Industry Segment at 1 \n(Aug. 29, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0290- 0131  (\u201cAstrachan Letter\u201d), JA 261.30  \nBecause no tile industry sources would be subject to the standards, EPA at the time of \nproposal requested comment on whether it was, in fact, required to finalize standards for the tile industry.  79 Fed.

In the final rule, EPA responded to \ncomments and appropriately concluded that, because the category contained major sources when it was listed, and because EPA is required to set standards for listed \n                                                 \n30 In 2003, EPA projected that four tile industry sources would be subject to major \nsource standards.

Since 2003, several  tile industry sources have changed their status:  one \nmajor source closed; three major sources became synthetic area sources; two area \nsources \u201cbriefly became major sources\u201d before becoming synthetic area sources; and \none new major sour ce became a synthetic area source.

Industry Br. 39.  In other words, TCNA interprets subse ctions 7412(c)(1), \n(c)(2), and (d) to prohibit  EPA from setting standards for a listed source category \nunless major existing sources that will be subject to the standards remain in the listed \ncategory at the time of the standard s\u2019 promulgation.  Id. at 40.   This interpretation is \ninconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain text.   \nThe CAA  clearly provides that EPA must promulgate standards for listed \ncategories, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(2), (e)(1), absent a decision to delist (see 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7412(c)(9)).  Further, it is at the time of listing that EPA\u2019s determination that there are \nmajor sources in the category is relevant.  As explained supra in Section VIII.A, EPA  \nis required to list categories of major sources, and it is the listing of a category that triggers EPA\u2019 s obligation to set standards.  The CAA does not require EPA to \nreevaluate its decision to list a category before issuing standards.\n31  Indeed, this Court \n                                                 \n31 TCNA\u2019s argument that EPA interprets the statute to allow major source \n\u201cregulations for every existing or imaginable  industry, regardless of whether a major \nsource had been or would ever exist in the industry,\u201d Industry Br. 42, is incorrect.  \nRather, EPA interprets the statute to only direct it to list categories of major sources \nwhen the categories contain major source s.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at 31,579/3 (noting that USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 103 of 135\n-89- \n has considered unlawful EPA\u2019s removal of a source category from the list on any \nbasis other than th ose provided in section 7412(c)(9) , which does not authorize \ndelisting on the basis of a  finding that the source category no l onger contains major \nsources.  New Jersey , 517 F.3d at 582- 83. \nNor is there any reason to doubt that EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation i s \nconsistent with congressional intent.  Congress required EPA to set standards for \nboth existing sources and new sources.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d) .  In requiring EPA to \nset standards for new  major sources, Congress clearly contemplated that EPA could \nset standards that might never apply, as it is possible that no new major sources would \nbe built in a source category.  \nFurther, even if no major existing sources are subject to the major source \nstandards when they are promulgated, those standards can still hav e environmental \nbenefits.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,508/3 -09/3 .  First, major sources in a given category may \nchoose to become synthetic area sources before major source standards go into effect, see Seitz Memo at 5 -7, JA 445-447, thus reducing th ose sources\u2019 emissions in advance \nof the reductions required by the standards.  Second, having major source standards \n                                                 \nEPA only listed categories of major sources \u201cwhere there was reasonable certainty \nthat at least one stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources \nin the category are commonly located on the premises of major sources\u201d).  Further, \nTCNA does not, and cannot , contend that major sources never existed  in the tile \nindustry.  See, e.g., Updated Inventory Database and Documentation fo r Clay Ceramics \nProposed Rule at 1 -3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-0290- 0222 , JA264 -266 \n(describing  major tile industry sources); Astrachan Letter  at 1, JA261 (stating that \nformer major sources in the tile industry had become synthetic area sources). USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 104 of 135\n-90- \n in effect may deter natural area sources and synthetic area sources from increasing \ntheir emissions to avoid becoming subject to the major source standard s.  See Industry \nBr. Attachment B \u00b6\u00b6  5-7.  In the absence of major source standards, area and \nsynthetic area sources  might  have an incentive to increase emissions to become major \nsources.  And, as EPA explained, this incentive is greater when sources are a lready \nsubject to area source standards.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,509/1.  Further, if EPA were required to identify a source emitting at major source levels at the time of setting standards , as preferred by TCNA , then it is possible that sources emitting at maj or \nsource levels could become synthetic area sources during the rulemaking process to head off the promulgation of major source standards.  See id.  Indeed , after EPA listed \nthe clay ceramics manufacturing  source category, and while EPA was in the process of \nsetting these standards, the remaining major sources in the tile industry become synthetic area sources.  See Astrachan Letter , JA260-262; Updated Inventory Database \nand Documentation for Clay Ceramics Proposed Rule  at 2-3 (Nov. 6, 2014) , EPA -\nHQ-OAR -2013 -0290- 0222 , JA265-266  (showing changes in tile industry sources\u2019 \nstatus).\n32  Under TCNA\u2019s interpretation, EPA would have to hold off on setting \nstandards for the listed source category until it could again identify a source emitting \n                                                 \n32 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, the distinction between a major sour ce and an area \nsource is not as clear as it may at first seem.  See supra Section IV.A.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 105 of 135\n-91- \n at major source levels,  at which point the source could become a synthetic area source \nand (again) foreclose EPA from setting standards.   \nIn addition to creating a regulatory loophole that would prevent EPA from \nsetting appropriate major source standards,33  TCNA\u2019s interpretatio n would be \nincredibly inefficient, as EPA would possibly need to rework or abandon proposed \nstandards every time sources changed their status.  In short, even if there were any \nambiguity in the statute (and there is not), EPA\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable, and should be upheld under Chevron  step two.\n34 \nC. EPA complied with notice and comment procedures in issuing the \nstandards.  \nTCNA argues that it \u201cwas never afforded the opportunity to comment\u201d on \nEPA\u2019s position that listed sources must be regulated, and that it \u201chad no reasonable \nnotice of this position\u201d from the proposal.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA also argues that \n                                                 \n33 TCNA asserts that there is no such loophole because section 7412(j) applies to \nrequire case -by-case emission limits when section 7412(d) standards have been \nvacated, and cites a 2010 proposal to revise EPA\u2019s section 7412(j) rule as support.  \nIndustry Br. 41 n.6.  However, case -by-case standards are intended to be a stopgap for \nthe period of time before EPA promulgates standards for a source category, not a \npermanent su bstitute for source category standards.  Further, the existence of section \n7412(j) does not change EPA\u2019s duty to promulgate section 7412 standards for the clay \nceramics category.  See  Sierra Club, 850 F. Supp. 2d. at 304.  \n \n34 Additionally, because EPA did not act beyond the scope of the CAA, there is no \nlegitimate constitutional challenge to EPA\u2019s actions.  See Industry Br. 44 (arguing that \nEPA violated Article II).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 106 of 135\n-92- \n EPA\u2019s position was not a logical extension of the proposal.  Id.  at 46-47.  TCNA is \nwrong on all counts.   \nFirst, when EPA proposed standards in 2014, EPA specifically requested \ncomment on whether it must set major source standards for the tile industry in light \nof the fact that all of the major sources had become synthetic area sources.  79 Fed. \nReg. at 75,665/ 2-3.  But EPA also noted that it was required to set standards for the \nlisted clay ceramics manufacturing source category pursuant to section 7412(c), and \nthat the D.C. District Court had already found EPA\u2019s mandatory duty to set standards \nfor this listed  source category remained in place after vacatur of the 2003 Rule.  Id. at \n75,627/1-2.  Further, EPA\u2019s longstanding position, as reflected in its initial 1992 listing notice, is that the CAA requires EPA to set standards for listed sources.  See 57 \nFed. Re g. at 31,577/ 3.  In any event, EPA made clear it was proposing to set \nstandards for major sources in the tile industry, and TCNA had ample opportunity to \ncomment on all aspects of whether such regulation was legally appropriate.  See 79 \nFed. Reg. at 75,657- 58 (Tables 10,  11).   \nIX. TCNA cannot now challenge EPA\u2019s listing of the major source \ncategory, and its challenge is without merit.  \nA. TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing is untimely.  \nTCNA challenges EPA\u2019s section 7412(c) listing of the major source category \ncontain ing the tile industry.  EPA agrees that section 7412(e)(4) prohibits legal \nchallenges to EPA\u2019s decision to list categories of major sources prior to the issuance USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 107 of 135\n-93- \n of emission  standards.35  See Industry Br. 45.  However, TCNA\u2019s challenge to the \nlisting decisi on is un timely.  As provided in section 7412(e)(4), the time to challenge \nthe listing of a source category arises \u201cwhen the Administrator issues emission \nstandards for such . . . category.\u201d  With respect to the clay ceramics category, that occurred in 2003 , when EPA promulgated the initial Brick/Clay Rule.  At that time, \nTCNA had 60 days to challenge the category\u2019s listing.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7607(b)(1).  TCNA \ndid not do so.  Having waived its arguments concerning the validity of the listing \ndecision after the standards were issued in 2003, TCNA cannot now assert them.  The vacatur of the 2003 Rule did not change or affect the prior listing , and does not \nchange TCNA\u2019s inability to raise this argument.  Petitioners had an opportunity to challenge the listing and fa iled to pursue any timely challenge.  \nFurther, it would be nonsensical to read Section 7412(e)(4) to allow litigants to \nreassert challenges to the listi ng decision every time emission  standards are issued, \nreissued or revised for a category.  Section 7412( e)(4) is more reasonably read to allow \nEPA to list categories of major sources of HAPs and begin the process of setting emission  standards for those categories without interruption from protracted \nlitigation.  In short, Congress provided an opportunity to challenge listing decisions, \n                                                 \n35 Section 7412(e)(4) states that \u201cno action of the Administra tor . . . listing a source \ncategory or subcategory under subsection (c) of this section shall be a final agency \naction subject to judicial review, except that any such action may be reviewed under \nsubsection 7607 of this title when the Administrator issues emission standards for \nsuch . . . category.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(e)(4).   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 108 of 135\n-94- \n even though it delayed judicial review of the listing of a category until after emission \nstandards for that category were issued, but Congress limited the timeframe for \nchallenges  to EPA\u2019s actions.  Therefore, the Court should dismiss TCNA\u2019s challenge \nto the listing decision as untimely, and need not reach the merits of this issue.  \nB. EPA\u2019s listing of the major source category was proper.   \nEven if TCNA\u2019s challenge to the listing were timely, it would fail on the merits.  \nTCNA claims that the listing was not adequately supported, and was unlawfully \nfinalized because EPA failed to provide notice and an opportunity to comment.  Industry Br. 44 -47.  TCNA is wrong on both counts.  \n1. EPA adequately supported its basis for the listing.  \nTCNA argues that there must be a \u201ccitation in the relevant EPA docket to a \nmajor source\u201d in the tile industry before EPA can promulgate section 7412(d) standards for the industry.  Industry Br. 46.  TCNA cites the initial 1992 listing notice \nand claims that  the docket contains no citation to any sources in the ceramic tile \nmanufacturing industry.  Id.   This argument misses the mark.  EPA replaced the 1992 \nlisting of the clay products manufacturing category with the listing of the clay \nceramics manufacturing category in 2002, at the same time that it proposed setting \nstandards for the listed category.  Because the 2002 listing superseded the 1992 listing, any challenge TCNA would have to the listing would be to EPA\u2019s 2002 decision.  See 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/ 2-3.     USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 109 of 135\n-95- \n When EPA listed the clay ceramics manufacturing category in 2002, it had \nample information to conclude that sources in that category, including tile industry sources , \nwere major sources.  See supra  note 30; 67 Fed. Reg. at 47,91 3/3-1 4/1; Documentation \nof Database of Responses to the 1997 EPA Information Collection Request for Clay \nCeramics Manufacturing  at 306-09 (Table 11) (Dec. 6, 2001), A-2000- 48; II -B-20, \nJA205-208 (showing four major sources in the tile industry).  And the fact that there \nwere major sources at the time of listing cannot be disputed.  Further, prior to the promulgation of the 2003 Rule, EPA received no comments challenging t he listing of \nthe category based on the absence of major tile industry sources.  See generally 2003 \nClay Rule Summary of Public Comments and Responses (Feb. 2003) , A-2000-48, IV -\nA-1 (\u201c2003 Clay Rule RTC \u201d), JA214.   \nEven if TCNA could challenge the initial 1992 listing, whether the docket for \nthe initial list identifies any ceramic tile manufacturing sources has no effect on the \nvalidity of the listing, because the listed category at that time was clay products \nmanufacturing.\n36  EPA needed only to conclude th at there were major sources in the \ncategory it listed , 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(c)(1),  and EPA did just that.  See 57 Fed. Reg. at \n31,591/3 (Table 1), 31,592/3 n.a.  EPA\u2019s rationale for listing all categories, including \nclay products manufacturing, was based on \u201cr easonable certainty that at least one \n                                                 \n36 TCNA is careful to describe its challenge to the listing based on a lack of material in \nthe docket \u2014rather than claiming that major sources in the tile industry did not exist \nat that time\u2014presumably because it could not credibly asse rt that there were not \nmajor til e industry sources at the time.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 110 of 135\n-96- \n stationary source in the category is a major source or where sources in the category \nare commonly located on the premises of major sources.\u201d   Id. at 31,579/3.  And EPA \nexplicitly found that it had \u201cinformation indicating that [the clay products manufacturing] source category contains a major source.\u201d  Documentation for \nDeveloping the Initial Source Category List, Final Report at B-45 (July 1992) , A-90-\n49, IV -A-55/V-B-1, JA928.  Although the tile industry would later be described as \npart of the initially- listed clay products manufacturing category, see supra at 85-86, \nthere is no requirement that at the time EPA listed the category, it had to identify major sources of every industry that might later be co nsidered part of that initially -\nlisted category.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(c)(1) (requiring publication, and revision if \nappropriate, of a list of categories of major sources).\n37  Therefore, EPA\u2019s 1992  listing \nof the cla y products manufacturing category as a major source category pursuant to \nsection 7412(c)(1) was valid . \n                                                 \n37 EPA explained that in proposing standards for each category, it planned to revise \nthe list and better describe the industries in each categ ory.  57 Fed. Reg. at 31,590/3 -\n91/1.  This approach ensured that as EPA accumulated information and developed \nproposed standards for a category, it could properly describe the sources within the \nlisted category that would be subject to the standards.  See, e.g., 67 Fed. Reg. at \n47,896/2-3, 47,898/3- 99/2, 47,913/3-14/1 (replacing one initially-listed category with \ntwo categories and describing sources in those categories).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 111 of 135\n-97- \n 2. TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the 2002 \nlisting decision in the rulemaking for the 2003 Rule.  \nTCNA had notice and an opportunity to comment on the listing in 2002, when \nEPA  proposed standards for the clay ceramics manufacturing category.38  67 Fed. \nReg. at 47,896/ 2-3.  Providing notice of and opportunity to comment on the listing at \nthe time standards are proposed is consistent with section 74 12(e)(4), which provides \nthat the window  for judicial review commences when EPA issues  emission standards.   \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(e)(4).  This approach is also pragmatic:  it allows EPA to better \ndescribe the sources within the listed category that will be subject to the standards; \nand until standards are developed, listing of a category has no actual effect on its sources.  See supra note 37.  In the  2002 proposal preamble , EPA explained that it was \nreplacing the clay products source category with two categories, including the clay ceramics manufacturing category.  67 Fed. Reg. at 47,896/2 -3.  EPA requested \ncomment on the listing and the sources covered by the listing.  Id.  at 47,896/3.  After \npublication of the 2002 proposal , TCNA could not credibly claim that its members \nhad no notice of the listing and no opportunity to comment on it.  In fact, tile companies commented  that EPA \u201cshould delist ceramic tile roller kilns from the final \n[standards].\u201d   Comments on  Proposed Rule Submitted for American Marazzi Tile and \nMonarch Ceramic Tile at 32 (C omment  4) (Sept. 19, 2002), A -2000-48 , IV-D-07, \n                                                 \n38 Although TCNA asserts these claims under the APA, these claims can only be \nconsidere d, if at all, under CAA section 7607.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(1).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 112 of 135\n-98- \n JA209; 2003 Clay Rule RTC at 2-38, JA 214.  Therefore EPA has satisfied any notice \nand comment requirements for the listing.  \nX. EPA reasonably set the dioxin/furan standards and adequately \nresponded to public comment.  \nIn the Clay Rule, EPA issued numeric dioxin/furan MACT emission limits for \nall new and existing ceramic tile roller kilns, sanitaryware tunnel kilns, floor tile press \ndryers, and ceramic tile spray dryers.  80 Fed. Reg . at 65,478 /3, T able 5.  TCNA \nargues that the dioxin/furan standards are not based on \u201cemissions information\u201d \nbecause EPA requested that sources use a flawed test method to report emissions.  Industry Br. 48 -50.  Additionally, TCNA argues that EPA did not comply with notice \nand comment procedures and that the standards were not a logical outgrowth of the proposal.  Id. at 51.  These arguments lack merit.  EPA prov ided su fficient support for \nthe test method.  Additionally, TCNA had ample opportunity to comment on the use \nof the test method, and EPA responded to TCNA\u2019s comments.   \nA. EPA reasonably determined that Method 23 provided emissions \ninformation that could be u sed in determining MACT floors for \nceramic tile sources.  \nBecause each tile industry subcategory contained less than 30 sources, EPA \ndetermin ed the MACT floors based on the lowest-emitting 5 sources for which EPA \nhad emissions information.   See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d)(3)(B).  In gathering information USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 113 of 135\n-99- \n for the standards, EPA requested that sources use EPA Test Method 2339 to report \ndioxin/furan emissions. See, e.g., 2010 Section 114 Information Collection Request to \nDal-Tile Corp. , Enclosure 3 at 1 -3 (Table 1.1) (Mar. 9, 2010), EPA -HQ-OAR -2013-\n0290- 0023, JA218- 220.  EPA used the information submitted in response to \ndetermin e the dioxin/furan MACT floors for the tile industry.  See Clay MACT Floor \nMemo  at 2, 8 -12, JA336, 342-346. \nTCNA argues that Method 23 is outdated and does not account for naturally -\noccurring non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials used by the \ntile industry.  Industry Br. 49.  For this reason, TCNA argues that Method 23 \nerroneously reports n on-gaseous dioxin/furan as emissions, and therefore the data \nproduced by Method 23 are not \u201cemissions information.\u201d  TCNA asserts that EPA \nignored this problem and unlawfully relied on the Method 23 data.  Id.   These \narguments fail.40  \n                                                 \n39 Method 23 is a specific sampling method used to determine emissions of dioxin and \nfuran.

Industry Br. 50 .  But b ecause EPA set the \nstandards at MACT floor level s, EPA could not have made those standards less \nstringent.  See Nat\u2019l Lime, 233 F.3d at 640 (holding that the CAA \u201cdoes not provide \nfor exceptions from emissions standards based on de minimis  principles where a \nMACT floor exists\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).

See \nIndustry Br. 48; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 74 12(d)(3).  Here, EPA reasonably considered the results \nof Method 23 tests to provide \u201cemissions informa tion.\u201d  See Clay Rule RTC at 1 2-19, \nJA390-397 (explaining Method 23\u2019s validity and appropriateness in generating \nemissions information on dioxin/furan for ceramic tile sources).41  EPA reviewed the \ndata submitted by the tile industry and determined that \u201cth e recovery of labeled dioxin \nand furan congeners met method requirements\u201d and that the samples generated valid data.  Clay Rule RTC at 12, JA 390.  And although implementation of Method 23 \nvaried, EPA found that the quality control inherent in the method su pported the \nvalidity and accuracy of the results.  Id.  at 12, 16, 18 , JA390, 394, 396.  For several \ncategories with sources similar to those in the tile industry, EPA had found that \nMethod 23 produced \u201cvalid data for particle bound and gaseous chlorinated dioxin.\u201d  \nId. at 16.  Furthermore, the fact that EPA is working to revise  Method 23, Industry \nBr. 49- 50, does not invalidate the data collected using the method.  See Clay Rule RTC \nat 15, JA 393.  EPA specifically determined that the method produced useful emissions \ninformation for ceramic tile sources, and TCNA \u201cfailed to demonstrate that EPA\u2019s [method] \u2018bears no rational relationship to the reality it purports to represent. \u2019\u201d Cement \n                                                 \n41 Cont rary to TCNA\u2019s assertion, Industry Br. 48, EPA is not required to make an \nexplicit finding in the rulemaking docket that test data or other sources of information \nEPA considers are \u201cemissions information.\u201d   USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 115 of 135\n-101-  \n Kiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (quoting Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. v. EPA , 139 F.3 d 914, 923 \n(D.C. Cir. 1998)).  EPA\u2019s decision to use Method 23 data to determin e the MACT \nfloors was within the agency\u2019s area of expertise and is entitled to deference.  See Cement \nKiln, 255 F.3d at 867 (noting that the Court will \u201cdefer to an agency\u2019s dec ision to \nproceed on the basis of imperfect scientific information, rather than to invest \nresources to conduct the perfect study,\u201d and finding reasonable EPA\u2019s interpretation \nthat \u201cemissions information\u201d in section 7412(d)(3) included compliance data gather ed \nunder another statute  (quoting Sierra Club, 167 F.3d at 662) (internal quotation  marks  \nomitted)).   \nB. EPA provided notice and adequately responded to comments \nregarding the dioxin/furan standards.  \nEPA provided sufficient opportunity for TCNA to comment on EPA\u2019s use of \nMethod 23, and EPA was not required to describe in the proposal its justification  for \nusing Method 23.  See  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(3) (requiring a statement of the basis and \npurpose of a proposed rule, including a summary of the factual data and  methodology \nused).  Indeed, as demonstrated by its comments, TCNA had the opportunity to \ncomment on the use of the method, including its concern that the method was unjustified.  As required, EPA responded to those comments and provided \njustification for using Method 23.  Clay Rule RTC at 11-19, JA 389-397.  \nFurther, EPA considered and rejected TCNA\u2019s arguments against using \nMethod 23.  EPA explained that \u201cthe quality control inherent in the method provides USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 116 of 135\n-102-  \n adequate support for the validity and accuracy of the emission results.\u201d  Clay Rule \nRTC at 12, JA 390.  In responding to TCNA\u2019s concern that Method 23 does not \naccount for non-gaseous forms of dioxin/furan contained in raw materials, EPA explained that it had no basis to conclude (and TCNA did not provide any) that TCNA\u2019s concern was warranted.  Id.   Method 23 had been successfully implemented \nto measure dioxin/furan from other source categories, and EPA noted that the same requirements for evaluating the validity of the data still applied.  Id. at 12, 16, JA390, \n394.  EPA reviewed the Method 23 data submitted by tile industry sources and found they \u201cmet method requirements\u201d and \u201cgenerated valid data on emission concentration.\u201d  Id. at 12, JA 390; see id. at 16 -18, JA 394-396 (describing validation \nmethodology  for data collected from tile industry sources). \nIn characterizing EPA\u2019s response to TCNA\u2019s comments in the preamble as \u201ca \nsix-sentence non -responsive brush-off,\u201d Industry Br. 51, TCNA overlooks (1) EPA\u2019s \nmore thorough responses to TCNA\u2019s comments in its r esponse -to-comments \ndocument, see Clay Rule RTC at 1 2-19, JA 390-397; and (2) the fact that the cited \nstatements in the preamble, 80 Fed.

And with respect to TCNA\u2019s \nargument that EPA\u2019s final rule was not a logical outgrowth of the proposal, see Industry Br. 51, EPA did not change its position:  EPA proposed to and did use \nMethod 23.  Thus, the question of logical outgrowth does not even arise here.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 117 of 135\n-103-  \n XI. EPA\u2019s decision not to set standards for periods of malfunction is \nreasonable and entitled to deference.  \nTCNA argues that EPA arbitrarily and capriciously failed to set standards for \nperiods of malfunction.  Industry Br. 52.  Because EPA did not use emissions data \nfrom periods of malfunction in setting standards, TCNA argues that EPA unlawfully \nset standards that EPA knew the regulated community had not and could not achieve.  \nId. at 53.  TCNA is wrong and ignores clear precedent that is contrary to its position.  \nThis Court recently recognized that because the best- controlled similar source \nis unlikely to be a malfunctioning source, the CAA, if anything, \u201cprevents [  ] EPA \nfrom takin g into account the effect of potential malfunctions when setting MACT \nemission standards\u201d and \u201c[a]t the very least\u201d \u201cpermits [  ] EPA to ignore malfunctions \nin its standard -setting and account for them instead through its regulatory discretion.\u201d  \nU.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2), (d)(3).  TCNA seeks to \ndistinguish the standards at issue here from the boiler standards at issue in U.S. Sugar  \nby arguing that, in this case, the docket contained information from a single facility \nduring som e malfunction events.  Industry Br. 52.  TCNA cites data from times when \nemission control devices were shut down, resulting in higher than normal emission levels.  See Dal Italia Responses to EPA 2010 Information Collection Request Startup \nand Shutdown Events  (Sept. 22, 2010) , EPA -HQ-OAR -2013- 0290-0028, Enclosure 1 \n(\u201cDal Italia Responses\u201d), JA 238-241.  Although some portions of the data were from \nmalfunctions of control  devices, EPA reasonably did not use those data to set USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 118 of 135\n-104-  \n standards.  EPA\u2019s rationale here is essentially the same as the rationale upheld in U.S. \nSugar .  Compare 830 F.3d at 606-09 (noting that EPA based its position on \u201cthe \nimpracticality of accounting for events that are necessarily unpredictable\u201d and that \nEPA explained that it would use its enforcement discretion to determine when \nemission exceedances were excusable) with 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3-83/2 (explaining \nthe impracticability of accounting for malf unctions in setting standards and asserting \nEPA would use its enforcement discretion).  As this Court has acknowledged, \u201c[w]hile the existence of malfunctions is entirely predictable, the nature of those malfunctions is not, and it is the malfunction\u2019s nature that affects emissions and thus is relevant to the application of emission limits.\u201d  U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And the Court \nupheld EPA\u2019s decision not to set alternative standards to cover malfunctions because \nthe decision to set those standards is purely within EPA\u2019s discretion and any such \nstandard applicable to malfunctions \u201cis likely to be hopelessly generic to govern such \na wide array of circumstances.\u201d  I d. at 608.  Here as well, EPA reasonably declined to \nconsider malfunction data in setting the standards.  See  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,482/3 \n(explaining that \u201caccounting for malfunctions in setting emission standards would be difficult , if not impossible\u201d).  Further, EPA adequately explained why it did not rely \non malfunction data.

Because malfunctions are unpredictable, there is no way of knowing when they USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 119 of 135\n-105-  \n TCNA also argues that EPA should have identified legal defenses in the \nregulation s.  Industry Br. 54.   To the extent TCNA seeks to have EPA write \naffirmative defenses into the regulations to protect sources that e xceed  standards due \nto malfunctions , this Court\u2019s past decisions clearly bar EPA from doing so.  NRDC  v. \nEPA , 749 F.3d at 1057 ; U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 607.  And, to the extent TCNA seeks \nto have EPA simply list defenses without adopting them or otherwise changing their \navailability, doing so  would neither affect  a defense\u2019s availability  nor change a court \u2019s \nrole to determine what, if any, defenses are properly con sidered in determin ing \npenalties.  NRDC  v. EPA, 749 F.3d at 1063.  In any event, EPA\u2019s statement that a \nsource \u201ccan raise any and all defenses,\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,483/2, simply states the \nlaw, and does not require or empower EPA to specify what defenses c ould possibly \nbe asserted.   \nXII. The mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile sources do \nnot require the use of activated carbon injection controls.  \nTCNA\u2019s argument that the mercury and dioxin/furan standards for ceramic tile \nkilns, spray dryers, an d tile dryers unlawfully require installation of activated carbon \ninjection controls is based on numerous flawed premises.  See Industry Br. 55 -56.  \nFirst, TCNA incorrectly suggests that the standards require use of a particular control \ntechnology.  Simila r to the brick standards discussed supra in Section VI, EPA set the \n                                                 \nwill occur or what their  effect on emissions will be.  EP A therefore reasonably set the \nstandards based on emissions information demonstrating what sources have achieved.  \nSee U.S. Sugar , 830 F.3d at 608.

See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,478 /2-3, Table 5.  Such standards do not require \nthe use of any pa rticular control technology, but instead allow for flexibility in the \nmethod sources use to comply.  Clay Rule RTC at 10 4, 10 5, JA 409, 410 (noting that \n\u201c[i]ndustry may use whatever means and methods they deem necessary to achieve \ncompliance with the emissi on limits\u201d).  And because the standards were set at the \nMACT floor level, they are based on emissions from the best-performing sources.  See \nid. at 103, JA 408.  The cost of using controls was not (nor could it have been) a \nconsideration in determin ing the MACT floor.  I d.; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d); NRDC v. \nEPA , 489 F.3d 1364, 1376 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201c[C]ost is not a factor that EPA may \npermissibly consider in setting a MACT floor.\u201d).   \nSecond, contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA was not required to conduct a \nbeyon d-the-floor analysis to prove that activated carbon injection controls would be \neffective for tile industry  sources.  See NRDC v. EPA, 489 F. 3d at 1376 (\u201c[The \npetitioner] relies on an incorrect premise that the MACT level of emissions reduction is invalid if it is based on control technology that a source cannot install.\u201d).  Although  \nin response to comments, EPA explained that activated carbon injection controls \nwould be appropriate for controlling mercury and dioxin/furan emissions for sources in the  tile industry, Clay Rule RTC at 104, JA 409, this was not a consideration in \nsetting the standard s and therefore would not be a valid basis for vacating the USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 121 of 135\n-107-  \n standards even if EPA had failed to support its reasoning.43  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7  7412(d); \nNRDC  v. EPA, 489 F .3d at 1376.  \nFinally, TCNA\u2019s argument that the cost of using activated carbon injection  \ncontrols  would be unconscionable, see Industry Br. 56, fails to present a legitimate \nlegal attack on the standards.  Because EPA set the standards at the MACT floor \nlevel, EPA was prohibited from setting less stringent standards based on costs.  NRDC  v. EPA, 489 F.3d at  1375 -76.\n44  Instead, th e standards must be based on \nemission levels actually achieved in the source category.  TCNA\u2019s challenge to the mercury and dioxin/furan emission standards for ceramic tile sources should \ntherefore be rejected.  \nXIII.  EPA set the standards for sanitaryware source s in compliance with the \nCAA.  \nTo obtain information for determin ing the MACT floor for sanitaryware \nsources, EPA sent information collection requests to manufactures of sanitaryware.  \n                                                 \n43 Contrary to TCNA\u2019s assertions, EPA did  conduct a beyond -the-floor analysis and \nconcluded that, for tile in dustry sources, \u201cthe incremental costs of additional control \nabove the MACT floor emission limits are not reasonable relative to the level of \nemission reduction achieved.\u201d  79 Fed. Reg. at 75,659/3.  Based on this finding, EPA \nproposed setting standards at the MACT floor levels.  Id.  \n \n44 It is only where EPA sets a more stringent \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d standard that it has \nto justify the more stringent standards by considering control types, costs, and other \nfactors.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2); NRDC  v. EPA, 749 F .3d at 1057.  See also White \nStallion , 748 F .3d at 1238-39 (noting that costs are reflected in MACT floor standards \nto the extent that MACT floors are determin ed based on what is already achieved by \nsources, which presumably reflects what is cost-effective).  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 122 of 135\n-108-  \n See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1-2 .  One source from which EPA requested emi ssions \ninformation had installed controls to comply with the new source MACT standards \nfrom the 2003 Rule.  See id. at 65,510/1.  That source, \u201cKiln 10,\u201d had stopped running \nthe controls in 2009, after its state operating permit was modified to reflect the  \nvacatur of the 2003 Rule.  Industry Br. 57 -58; see 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1.  However, \nthe controls remained functional and attached to the source.  See Industry Br. 58; 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,510/1 -2.  When EPA requested information from Kiln 10, it \nrequested that information be gathered while the controls were operating.  See 80 Fed. \nReg. at 65,510/ 1-2. \nKohler argues that EPA should have based its MACT floor calculations on  \ndata from when Kiln 10 was operating without  its controls.  Industry Br. 56 -63.  \nKohler contends that the Kiln 10 data were not representative of any existing source \noperating at the time when EPA determined the MACT floors, and that the MACT \nfloors for s anitaryware are improperly based on emissions data originating from a \nvacated standard, rather than on the actual performance of the best-performing sources.  Id.  Additionally, Kohler argues that the standards are inconsistent with \nEPA\u2019s stated objective that emission standards should reflect real -world performance.  \nId. at 62.   These arguments are wrong.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 123 of 135\n-109-  \n A. EPA set the MACT floors as required by the CAA, based on what \nhas been achieved.  \nKohler argues that EPA violated the CAA requirement that MACT floors be \nbased on the actual performance of the best-performing sources by artificially creating \na better -performing source.  Industry Br. 58.  EPA did nothing of the sort.  \nThe CAA requires EPA to set the MACT floors based on the \u201caverage \nemission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources\u201d for which EPA has \nemissions information or could reasonably obtain emissions information.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  The CAA does not set a time limit for when the emissions \ninformation that EPA uses in setting the MA CT floor is collected, nor does it specify \ncriteria for what emissions information may be used to show what has been achieved; it simply requires that the emissions limitation has been \u201cachieved.\u201d  See id.  Kohler  \nprovided dat a to EPA demonstrating emissio n levels Kiln 10 actually achieved with \ncontrols.  80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1-2.\n45  Although Kiln 10 does not currently operate \nthe controls, that does not change the fact that it had \u201cachieved\u201d emission  reductions \nwith the controls.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  And the data provided to EPA were not \nhypothetical speculation on what Kiln 10 could potentially achieve.  Rather, it was real-world emissions information that was produced from the actual operation of Kiln \n                                                 \n45 Kiln 10 not only provided data showing levels it had achieved during testing, it had \noperated for several years with controls.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/1.  In fact, Kiln \n10 was operating its controls in the year preceding EPA\u2019s request for emissions \ninformation.  Id.  USCA Case #15-1487      Document #1673174            Filed: 04/28/2017      Page 124 of 135\n-110-  \n 10.  See 80 Fed. Reg. at 65,510/2.   Because info rmation from Kiln 10 demonstrated \nemission  levels actually achieved by the source, EPA permissibly relied on it in \ndetermin ing the MACT floors.46  \nB. EPA was not required to omit emissions data bec ause a source \nachieved emission reductions to comply with a vac ated standard.  \nKohler argues that because Kiln 10\u2019s controls were installed to comply with a \nstandard that was subsequently vacated, EPA should be prohibited from using Kiln \n10\u2019s emissions inf ormation.  Industry Br. 56 -60.  But vacatur of the 2003 Rule does \nnot affect the appropriateness of EPA\u2019s use of the Kiln 10 data.  Although the vacatur invalidated the obligation to comply with the 2003 standards, it did not erase the ability of the source to demonstrate emission  reductions that were actually achieved  in \npractice.  This Court has ruled that EPA acted lawfully in setting MACT floors using data collected from sources complying with a remanded standard.  Med . Waste Inst ., \n645 F.3d at 426.  The Court explained that it was \u201cnot persuaded that remand without \nvacatur as opp osed to vacatur has the outcome -changing significance that petitioners \nascribe to it.\u201d  Id.   The same principle applies where, as here, a standard has been \nvacated.  EP A had no reason to doubt that the data from Kiln 10 demonstrat ed \nanything other than emission reductions that the source had actually achieved.  See 80 \nFed. Reg. at 65,510/2.

The co-signers\u2019 institutional affiliations are included for identification purposes \nonly and do imply institutional endorsement or support. We appreciate the opportunity to provide  \nwritten comments on EPA\u2019s Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) \n(hereafter referred to as the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation) conducted under the Toxic Substances \nControl Act (TSCA),1 which requires EPA to evaluate chemical risks based on the \u201cbest available \nscience.\u201d2 TCEP is a flame retardant chemical that is also used as a plasticizer and in paints and \ncoatings.  \nEPA appropriately determined that TCEP as a whole chemical presents unreasonable risk to \nhuman health and the environment based on high risks of cancer (including some exposures \nexceeding 1-in-1,000 cancer risk) and non-cancer effects to workers, consumers and the general \npopulation from multiple TCEP conditions of use. However, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation \nalso failed to evaluate risks for several conditions of use and relied  on scientific methods and \nassessments that are not consistent with the \u201cbest av ailable science,\u201d3 which can lead to \nunderestimating risk to human and environmental health.   \nEPA continued to rely on a systematic review methodology that is not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA \u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. The National Academies of \nSciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) recommended the use of exis ting systematic \nreview methods and improved approaches for TSCA risk ev aluations in 2021, and EPA has still \nnot implemented most of these recommendations.\n4 EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on \nChemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) has also recommended best practices in systemati c review to the Agency in \nmultiple reports.5  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is \naligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review \nprotocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.     \nThe TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation also relied on a hazard assessment that violates TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest \navailable science\u201d requirement. While EPA found that neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, \ndevelopmental toxicity, kidney toxicity and cancer  are all likely hazards of TCEP , it failed to \n1 U.S. EPA (2023) .

EXHIBIT E\n    \n 2 provide quantitative estimates of non-cancer risk. We applied methods developed by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) to quantify the non-cancer risk of male reproductive harm from chronic oral TCEP exposure, and found that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of exposures producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40, a risk level 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (1-in-1,000,000). EPA also inappropriately stated that a threshold exists for cancer risk, and did not appropriately use science-based adjustment factors.  EPA also failed to adequately identify and calculate risks posed to potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (\u201cPESS\u201d), as required under TSCA.6  Among the populations exposed to high risks from TCEP are breast-fed infants and people who consume fish (fishers in the general population, subsistence fishers and tribal populations), but EPA failed to consider individuals with pre-existing disease, genetic factors, lifestyle factors, or exposures to other chemical and non-chemical stressors that may increase susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposure. A failure to evaluate risk to these groups violates TSCA and results in risk characterization that is not representative of the human population.   EPA also failed to estimate risks for some TCEP conditions of use (for example, cushions in commercial furniture, consumer paints), claiming that it lacked sufficient data and that most of these uses have been discontinued  EPA is obligated under TSCA to estimate risks for all conditions of use that are \u201creasonably foreseen.\u201d7 Since any use that is voluntarily discontinued could resume, they should be considered \u201creasonably foreseen\u201d and EPA should include risk estimates for these uses in the final TCEP risk evaluation. TSCA also requires EPA to consider \u201creasonably available information\u201d when conducting risk evaluations,8 which includes data and information that EPA \u201ccan reasonably generate, obtain, and synthesize for use in risk evaluations.\u201d9 EPA failed to use its authority under TSCA to fill critical data gaps that could result in a more complete assessment of conditions of use. EPA also failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) in time to generate chemical release data to inform exposure assessments in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, which precluded its ability to adequately assess fenceline community exposures and risks.   Finally, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is the first EPA has released since it completed the initial 10 risk evaluations conducted under the amended TSCA in January 2021, and the first to not undergo panel peer review by EPA\u2019s SACC. EPA relied on the SACC to conduct panel peer reviews of the first 10 risk evaluations as well as EPA\u2019s proposed methods for fenceline assessment and systematic review to be used in the forthcoming risk evaluations, and provided EPA with numerous critical recommendations for improvement. For the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA has chosen to conduct a letter peer review, which precludes collaboration and consensus among reviewers and transparency and public participation in the review process, all of which are critical to maintaining scientific integrity and addressing potential financial conflicts of interest among reviewers. SACC panel peer review would also enable the examination of cross-cutting issues that arise in multiple evaluations and the extent to which EPA has addressed previous SACC recommendations, including those made to improve the fenceline  6 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12). 7 15 USC \u00a72602 (4). 8 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(k). 9 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.33 (defining \u201creasonably available information\u201d). \n    \n 3 screening methodology. We therefore urge EPA to conduct a SACC panel peer review for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and all TSCA risk evaluations that are currently in development  Our detailed comments on the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation address the following issues:  1. EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required. a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook. b. EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review. c. Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices. i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the risk evaluation. ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete. iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes. iv. The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  v. EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard and risk assessment. a. EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed. c. EPA failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects. This along with other appropriate factors needs to be added into the assessment.   3. EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.         \n    \n 4 We appreciate the opportunity to provide public input.

EPA has made some improvements in its approach to systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, but additional critical improvements are required.  a. EPA has taken an important step by not using quantitative scoring for study quality evaluation. This should be made explicit in future systematic reviews and in an updated TSCA systematic review handbook.   We support EPA\u2019s decision to discard the quantitative scoring method, which was previously used in TSCA systematic reviews and methodology documents to assess study quality and exclude some studies from consideration based on their quantitative scores, despite repeated criticism from peer reviewers and public commenters. EPA originally put forward its approach to systematic review under TSCA in 2018.10  In its review of the 2018 TSCA systematic review method, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (\u201cNASEM\u201d) said:  The reliance on numeric quality scores is problematic because scores do not distinguish between high- and low-quality studies, and the relationship between quality scores and an association or effect is inconsistent and unpredictable\u2026More generally, the use of numerical scoring in critical appraisal does not follow standards for the conduct of systematic reviews.11     Do not use numeric scores to evaluate studies.12    In 2021, EPA released its Draft Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Systematic Review Protocol (hereafter referred to as the 2021 Draft TSCA Method), asserting that this document addressed the NASEM recommendations.  However, the 2021 draft retained a quantitative study scoring method.  The review of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method by EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) reiterated the earlier NASEM recommendation:  EPA should follow NASEM recommendations and best practices of systematic review by removing its approach to determine an overall quality score based on the combination of quantitative ratings of each individual data quality evaluation metric, which is essentially a quantitative scoring approach.13  Since completion of the SACC review of the 2021 method, EPA has not issued an updated systematic review methodology.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation and its systematic review protocol provide the first indication of how EPA will proceed in conducting TSCA systematic review.  According to the risk evaluation and the protocol, EPA has now taken an important step by discarding the previous quantitative study scoring approach:   10 U.S. EPA (2018).

EPA has retained other problematic aspects of its approach to study quality evaluation that are inconsistent with best practices in systematic review.   The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation retains certain study quality evaluation metrics that are not consistent with best practices, violating TSCA\u2019s requirement for EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d16 when conducting risk evaluations and make decisions based on the \u201cweight of the scientific evidence.\u201d17 EPA\u2019s approach to study quality evaluation typically applies a set of metrics that assessors must evaluate for each relevant study during systematic review. The TCEP systematic review protocol states that the study quality metrics in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method were retained for the TCEP risk evaluation without revision (with the exception of minor edits to one toxicology metric).18  In applying the 2021 metrics, EPA inappropriately applied metrics to evaluate study quality based on statistical power and statistical significance, disregarding recommendations by the NASEM.  In The Use of Systematic Review in EP A's Toxic Substances Control Act Risk Evaluations, the NASEM stated that:   Many markers of a high-quality study (e.g., whether a study\u2019s investigator has performed a sample size calculation and whether the study is reported adequately or has received appropriate ethical approvals) are unlikely to have any direct implication for the potential for a study to be affected by bias.19  Statistical power and statistical significance are not markers of risk of bias or quality. Statistical significance is not a measure of association or strength of association and should not be used to evaluate studies. In fact, combining multiple  14 U.S. EPA (2023).

The Use of Systematic Review in EPA\u2019s Toxic Substances Control Act Risk Evaluations, p. 35. \n    \n 7 small, low-powered but similar studies in a synthesis is one of the potential benefits of systematic review.20 (emphasis added)  Despite these very explicit NASEM statements about the inappropriateness of these metrics being included in the study quality evaluations; EPA continues to use \u201cStatistical power (sensitivity)\u201d as a study quality metric.21 EPA must discontinue the use of these metrics in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation systematic review and for all risk evaluations that are currently in development.   c. Publication of a chemical-specific systematic review protocol is a critical improvement, but further steps are required for consistency with best practices.  i. A chemical-specific protocol has been prepared, but it was not released in advance of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Along with TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA released a Systematic Review Protocol for the Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) as a supplemental file.  This is the first time EPA has released a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for a TSCA systematic review, which is consistent with best available scientific methods in systematic review and responds to recommendation of the NASEM and the SACC.    However, for future TSCA risk evaluations, EPA must publish a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for public comment first in the process of conducting each risk evaluation (well in advance of completing the draft risk evaluation), which is also consistent with best practices for systematic review.22,23  EPA\u2019s TSCA program should follow the established procedures of EPA\u2019s IRIS program, which makes a draft protocol for each assessment publicly available in advance of its release for public comment. Following the public comment process, the IRIS program then publishes an updated protocol, as needed. For example, for the IRIS assessments of five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (\u201cPFAS\u201d), a draft protocol was made available for public comment for 45 days. The IRIS program then followed up with a revised protocol to address public comments, with documentation of the changes, that was published before the release of the PFAS draft assessments.24  EPA should be following this same approach for all TSCA risk evaluations.   ii. The TCEP systematic review protocol is incomplete.  The application of systematic review in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation includes elements that are not included in the TCEP systematic review protocol.  For example, EPA\u2019s TCEP systematic review protocol continues to require an overall study quality rating. EPA says that it is no longer  20 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2021).

The draft risk evaluation\u2019s description of the approach to human health hazard assessment includes:  EPA considered studies that received low, medium, or high overall quality determinations for hazard identification, evidence integration, and dose-response analysis\u2026Information from studies of uninformative quality were only discussed on a case-by-case basis for hazard identification and evidence integration and were not considered for dose-response analysis. For example, if an uninformative study identified a significantly different outcome compared with high- or medium-quality studies and the uninformative rating was not expected to influence the specific results being discussed, EPA considered the uninformative study for the hazard outcome being considered.25  (emphasis added)  The systematic review protocol, however, does not state that the overall quality ratings that may be selected for a study are high, medium, low, or uninformative, nor does it state how ratings of the many individual study metrics are combined to determine an overall rating.  The study quality term \u201cuninformative\u201d does not appear anywhere in the protocol. This indicates that the TSCA Draft Risk Evaluation is inappropriately applying methods that are not stated in the systematic review protocol.  To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should not derive an overall study rating, and instead implement the domain-based approach of the Navigation Guide.26  However, if EPA continues to develop overall study ratings, the method for doing so must be stated in systematic review protocols prior to their application.   In addition, the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation acknowledges that studies rated as uninformative may provide useful information (for example, in the quotation above); therefore, EPA should not use the term \u201cuninformative\u201d to describe relevant studies.    The TCEP systematic review protocol also fails to present a PECO statement for identifying relevant health hazard studies. A PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) statement provides criteria used to decide which studies are relevant to include in a systematic review and is a critical element of any systematic review protocol.27,28  EPA instead references the previous draft PECO statement for TCEP included in the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.  Other elements of the hazard evidence identification process similarly reference the 2021 document, which is cited repeatedly in Section 5.5 \u201cEnvironmental and Human Health Hazard\u201d of the TCEP protocol. Similarly, as discussed above, the 2021 Draft TSCA Method is referenced for the approach to study quality evaluation. Each chemical-specific protocol should be a stand-alone document that  25 U.S. EPA (2023).

Dividing the methods across multiple documents increases the risk of mistakes and confusion in conducting the risk evaluation, and makes review of the risk evaluation challenging for peer reviewers and the public. As recommended by the SACC,29 EPA should develop a TSCA systematic review handbook that can be cited in future protocols for specific elements that do not vary across risk evaluations, but only a final handbook should be cited in protocols and not the 2021 Draft TSCA Method.    iii. EPA references inconsistent PECO statements to identify relevant health effects studies that may inappropriately exclude non-apical effects such as cellular-level outcomes.  As noted above, the TCEP-specific systematic review protocol issued in 2023 references the 2021 Draft TSCA Method concerning the PECO statement used for identification of evidence relevant to assessing TCEP\u2019s human health hazards. The protocol states:  During data screening, EPA followed the process described in Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft Systematic Review Protocol (U.S. EPA, 2021), to conduct TIAB and full-text screening for TCEP literature search results, as guided by the PECO statement. The same PECO statement was used during TIAB and full-text screening for references considered for the evaluation of environmental and human health hazard resulting from exposure to TCEP.30  (emphasis added)   This statement is unclear because Appendix H.5.7 of the 2021 Draft TSCA Method presents two different PECO statements:  one to be used for title-abstract screening (Table_Apx H-31) and a different PECO to be used for full text screening Table_Apx H-33). The 2023 TCEP systematic review protocol does not indicate which PECO statement has been used in conducting the TCEP risk evaluation. One important difference between the two versions of the PECO statement is in specifying the outcomes considered relevant. In Table_Apx H-31, outcomes are:  Human: All health outcomes (both cancer and non-cancer)  Animal and Plants: All biological effects (including bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured water and tissue concentrations).   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact effects.31  In Table_Apx H-33, important changes are made to the outcomes (additions are underlined, deletion shown in strikethough):   29 U.S. EPA (2022).

Draft Systematic Review Protocol Supporting TSCA Risk Evaluations for Chemical Substances Version 1.0, Table_Apx H-31. \n    \n 10 Human: All health outcomes (cancer and non-cancer) at the organ level or higher.  Animal and Plants: All apical biological effects (effects measured at the organ level or higher) and bioaccumulation from laboratory studies with concurrently measured media and/or tissue concentrations. Apical endpoints include but are not limited to reproduction, survival, and growth.   Screener note:  \u2022 Measurable biological effects relevant for humans, animals and plants may include but are not limited to: mortality, behavioral, population, cellular, physiological, growth, reproduction, systemic, point of contact (irritation and sensitization) effects.  \u2022 Effects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.32    The PECO statement in Table_Apx H-33 incorporates several limitations on health effects studies that are considered by EPA to be relevant for hazard identification. For human studies, this second PECO statement specifies that only studies \u201cat the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. For animal studies, the second PECO statement specifies that only \u201capical\u201d effects \u201cmeasured at the organ level or higher\u201d are to be included. The \u201cscreener note\u201d for this PECO deletes \u201ccellular\u201d from the list of relevant measurable biological effects and indicates that \u201cEffects measured at the cellular level of biological organization and below are to be tagged as supplemental, mechanistic.\u201d33  EPA says in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation that the same PECO was used for title-abstract and full-text screening, but it never states which version of the PECO was used.  If EPA used the second version of the PECO (Table_Apx H-33) in conducting the risk evaluation, this would be contrary to the clear advice of the SACC, which said:   EPA should not limit PECO/RESO statements to apical endpoints but consider expanding outcomes to include known upstream markers of effect such as biochemical markers of effect or other outcomes at the cellular level.34   Public comments on the 2021 Draft TSCA Method also detail the many problems with restricting the included studies to only those with apical outcomes or effects at the organ level or higher.35 Inclusion of the PECO in the TCEP systematic review protocol would have avoided any confusion regarding which version of the PECO was applied. To adhere to best practices in systematic review, EPA should specify which PECO statement was used in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and include that PECO statement in the chemical-specific systematic review protocol.  32 U.S. EPA (2021).

The TCEP protocol continues to use unclear terminology regarding evidence synthesis and integration.  EPA\u2019s use of unclear terminology for evidence synthesis and integration is an additional shortcoming of the TCEP systematic review protocol. The NASEM has recommended the use of the term \u201cevidence synthesis\u201d for assembling the evidence and drawing conclusions from a single evidence stream (e.g. toxicology, epidemiology), and \u201cevidence integration\u201d for the subsequent process of drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams.  The SACC review of EPA\u2019s 2021 Draft TSCA Method document reiterated this recommendation:  The EPA did not follow the recommendation of NASEM to separate evidence synthesis from evidence integration. To quote NASEM: \"Evidence synthesis deals with more homogeneous data within a single stream, and evidence integration deals with more heterogeneous data from multiple streams.\u201d36   The EPA could improve the clarify, transparency, and efficiency of its process by adopting the NASEM recommendation to use \u201csynthesis\u201d for drawing conclusions separately for each evidence stream (i.e., human, animal, and mechanistic evidence) and use \u2018integration\u2019 for drawing conclusions considering all evidence streams in combination \u2013 in context of the risk evaluation process/needs.37  In the TCEP systematic review protocol, however, EPA disregards the advice of both the NASEM and the SACC by continuing to use the term \u201cevidence integration\u201d for both steps.38 This is one more area in which EPA\u2019s approach differs from best practices in systematic review, violating TSCA. In addition, failing to adopt consistent and vetted terminology decreases the clarity of the risk evaluation and creates confusion for peer reviewers and the public regarding the procedures applied to drawing conclusions from a single stream of evidence.   v.  EPA should prepare a new TSCA systematic review methodology that is aligned with the best available scientific methods and issue updated draft systematic review protocols for all risk evaluations currently in development, including TCEP.    EPA has made some improvements in its approach to  systematic review under TSCA, particularly regarding the discontinuation of its quantitative approach to study quality evaluation. However, EPA has not indicated if these improvements, including changes to study quality evaluation, will be applied in all future TSCA risk evaluations.  EPA has instead stated that systematic review methods may vary across TSCA assessments.  In doing so, EPA has failed to  36 U.S. EPA (2022).

To adhere to best practices in systematic review, including those recommended by the NASEM and SACC, EPA should issue a new TSCA systematic review methodology document that states methods to be applied consistently to all TSCA rulemakings, which must include applying only qualitative methods for study quality evaluation.  EPA should also prepare a chemical-specific systematic review protocol for each TSCA risk evaluation it conducts, and these protocols should be complete, stand-alone documents that do not refer to the 2021 Draft TSCA Method for critical elements, such as PECO statements and methods for study quality evaluation.  The chemical-specific protocols for ongoing and future risk evaluations should also be released for public comment well before the draft risk evaluations are completed to allow for public input, scrutiny, and opportunities for improvement. We urge EPA to consistently adopt the practices of the IRIS program for systematic review protocol development and publication across all EPA programs and offices.     2. EPA should apply best available scientific methods to improve the TCEP hazard assessment.  a.  EPA should apply existing methods to generate quantitative estimates of non-cancer risks from TCEP exposures.  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation continues to rely on the scientifically-deficient methods for non-cancer dose-response analysis and risk characterization employed in previous TSCA risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s methods for non-cancer risk evaluation do not provide a quantitative estimate of risk. Instead, they rely on calculation of a margin of exposure (\u201cMOE\u201d), defined as:  Margin of Exposure = Non-cancer point of departure / Human exposure.39  The MOE approach is a scientifically inappropriate approach for characterizing risk and is inconsistent with amended TSCA\u2019s requirements to use the \u201cbest available science\u201d and to ensure protection of \u201cpotentially exposed and susceptible subpopulations\u201d (\u201cPESS\u201d).40 Use of the MOE, which relies on a point of departure (\u201cPOD\u201d) with no extrapolation to lower doses, is a simplistic approach that only examines the ratio of the POD to the exposure level and determines whether this ratio \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d or if \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d41 The MOE does not estimate the proportion of the exposed population projected to experience a specified health endpoint or the number of individuals affected, and it perpetuates the scientifically flawed notion that a \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cno risk\u201d level of  39 U.S. EPA (2023).

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 13 chemical exposure can be identified for a diverse exposed population.42,43 The National Academies44 and the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d)45 have outlined more robust methods for risk estimation that more accurately account for variability and vulnerability across the human population and have been demonstrated in published case studies.46,47,48,49   We applied the WHO methodology to estimate risks of adverse effects from chronic inhalation and oral exposure to TCEP using EPA\u2019s identification of hazards and estimation of points of departure (PODs).  Specifically, we estimated risks of male reproductive effects (decreased numbers of seminiferous tubules), using EPA\u2019s POD of 2.73 mg/kg-d for oral exposure and 14.9 mg/m3 for inhalation exposure.50  The PODs are drawn from a 35-day study in mice.  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characterization (i.e. selection of a \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d) included an interspecies adjustment factor and a human variability adjustment factor, but inappropriately omitted an adjustment factor accounting for the subchronic duration of the mouse study.  Our application of the WHO methodology includes an adjustment for study duration along with the interspecies and human variability adjustments.   In applying the WHO methodology (see Technical Appendix for details) to risks of adverse male reproductive effects from oral exposure to TCEP, we found that: \u2022 0.06 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 1% of the population, \u2022 0.02 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.1% of the population, \u2022 0.008 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for oral exposure to TCEP uses 2.73 mg/kg-d as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.51 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d52 for any chronic exposure less than 2.73 mg/kg-d / 30 = 0.09 mg/kg-d. By applying the WHO methodology, we found that the upper bound risk at an exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. This risk level is  42 Woodruff, T. J., Rayasam, S. D. G., Axelrad, D.

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 14 25,000 times higher than the target range that EPA typically applies for protection of carcinogenic risks (see below).  Following EPA\u2019s approach for extrapolating from oral exposures to inhalation exposures, the above values can be expressed as inhalation exposures in mg/m3 by multiplying by 5.44.53  For example, the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population is 0.008 x 5.44 = 0.04 mg/m3.  EPA must incorporate this approach to non-cancer dose-response and risk characterization in the final TCEP risk evaluation.  Our analysis demonstrated that EPA\u2019s current approach results in acceptance of any exposures less than those producing an upper bound risk of 1-in-40,  a risk level that is unacceptably high, even by EPA\u2019s own standards;  EPA typically applies a target range of protection for carcinogenic risks of 1-in-10,000 (10-4) to 1-in-1,000,000 (10-6).54 To offer the strongest public health protections, EPA should target any upper bound risks of non-cancer effects from TCEP exposure to be no more than 1-in-1,000,000 risk level. b. EPA\u2019s statements regarding a threshold for cancer are not scientifically supported and must be removed.  EPA has appropriately modeled cancer dose-response as a linear relationship with no threshold, consistent with EPA\u2019s Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment for a carcinogen without an identified mode of action (MOA).  However, EPA  incorrectly states  that because TCEP does not act through a known mutagenic MOA, there is a threshold below which there is no cancer risk:  Because direct mutagenicity is not likely to be the predominant MOA, using linear low dose extrapolation is a health conservative analysis that would overpredict risks assuming that TCEP acts via a threshold MOA.55 (emphasis added)  Assuming all TCEP exposure is associated with some risk is likely to be health conservative because EPA does not believe that a mutagenic MOA is likely for TCEP and a threshold below which cancer does not occur is expected to exist. However, information is lacking with which to determine an appropriate threshold.56 (emphasis added)  EPA provides no evidence to support its speculation that there is a threshold for TCEP\u2019s cancer risk.  The absence of a known mutagenic MOA is not sufficient evidence to support these statements, as carcinogens acting by other MOAs can operate with no threshold.  Further, the NASEM states that human variability, exposure to other chemicals, and background disease processes alone can result in linear dose-response relationships at low doses, regardless of whether mutagenic MOAs are known:   53 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 54 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. 55 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 291. 56 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 334 (repeated on page 418). \n    \n 15 Background exposures and underlying disease processes contribute to population background risk and can lead to linearity at the population doses of concern.57  The current EPA practice of determining \u201cnonlinear\u201d MOAs does not account for mechanistic factors that can create linearity at low dose. The dose-response relationship can be linear at a low dose when an exposure contributes to an existing disease process\u2026Effects of exposures that add to background processes and background endogenous and exogenous exposures can lack a threshold if a baseline level of dysfunction occurs without the toxicant and the toxicant adds to or augments the background process. Thus, even small doses may have a relevant biologic effect. That may be difficult to measure because of background noise in the system but may be addressed through dose-response modeling procedures. Human variability with respect to the individual thresholds for a nongenotoxic cancer mechanism can result in linear dose-response relationships in the population\u2026In the laboratory, nonlinear dose-response processes\u2014for example, cytotoxicity, impaired immune function and tumor surveillance, DNA methylation, endocrine disruption, and modulation of cell cycles\u2014may be found to cause cancer in test animals. However, given the high prevalence of those background processes, given cancer as an end point, and given the multitude of chemical exposures and high variability in human susceptibility, the results may still be manifested as low-dose linear dose-response relationships in the human population.58  To adhere to best practices in risk characterization, EPA must remove the statements quoted above regarding a cancer threshold for TCEP from the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation before it is finalized.    c. EPA incorrectly failed to apply an adjustment factor for the subchronic duration of the animal study used for estimating risk of male reproductive effects.  EPA omitted critical uncertainty factors (UFs) when characterizing non-cancer risk in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, violating TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available science\u201d requirement. To estimate the non-cancer risks of TCEP, EPA used data from a 35-day mouse study (Chen et al. 2015)59 to derive a POD for male reproductive effects (decreased number of and degeneration of seminiferous tubules), and employed the \u201cbenchmark MOE\u201d bright-line approach to determine whether a chronic exposure is sufficiently below the POD.  To calculate the benchmark MOE for risk characterization using the Chen et al. POD, EPA applied an interspecies uncertainty factor (UF) of 3 to account for uncertainties related to any animal-to-human differences remaining after calculation of a human equivalent concentration, and an intraspecies UF of 10 to account for uncertainties around human variability, for an overall UF of 30 (10 x 3).  Thus, according to EPA, any exposure less than 30-fold lower than the POD \u201cis interpreted as a human health risk of concern\u201d and for exposures more than 30-fold lower \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d60   57 National Research Council (2009).

Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 296. \n    \n 16 The section of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation on determination of the benchmark MOE makes no mention of the subchronic-to-chronic study duration UF that is usually applied to account for the lower dose that may produce the same effect if a chronic study were conducted.  Inclusion of a subchronic UF would increase the benchmark MOE and in turn lower EPA\u2019s bright line for identifying risks of concern by a factor of 3 to 10.  Failure to increase the benchmark MOE applied to the POD for male reproductive effects from Chen et al. with a subchronic UF therefore results in significant underestimation of risk, potentially by up to an order of magnitude.  The risk evaluation acknowledges the uncertainty in using a POD from a subchronic study:  it is uncertain whether the POD would be lower if Chen et al. (2015a) extended the exposure duration.61  Using Chen et al. (2015a) to represent chronic exposure durations adds uncertainty to the risk evaluation. If the specific effect identified by Chen et al. (2015a) were measured in a chronic study in the same species starting in adolescence, the POD could be more sensitive. Therefore, it is possible that risks might be under-predicted.62  However, the risk evaluation lacks any discussion of the possible use of a subchronic UF to address that uncertainty.  As discussed above, EPA must use probabilistic methods, including adjustment for the subchronic study duration, for dose-response assessment and risk characterization of non-cancer effects.    3.  EPA has not appropriately identified potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations (PESS), as required by TSCA.  In the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, EPA identifies the following groups as PESS:  infants exposed through human milk from exposed individuals, children and male adolescents who use consumer articles or are among the exposed general population, subsistence fishers, tribal populations, pregnant women, workers and consumers who experience aggregated or sentinel exposures, fenceline communities who live near facilities that emit TCEP, and firefighters.63  Identification of PESS for each chemical assessed is a critical aspect of conducting risk evaluation under TSCA, and TSCA requires EPA to  determine whether a chemical substance presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation.64    61 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 283. 62 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 290. 63 U.S. EPA (2023).  Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 329. 64 15 USC \u00a72605(b)(4)(A). \n    \n 17 In the final 2017 TSCA Risk Evaluation Framework Rule, EPA defined PESS (using the statutory definition) as:  a group of individuals within the general population identified by the Administrator who, due to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or mixture, such as infants, children, pregnant women, workers, or the elderly.65   To date, EPA has not employed a consistent or structured approach to identifying PESS in its TSCA risk evaluations, including scope documents for ongoing risk evaluations. EPA\u2019s approach and terminology for identifying PESS varied considerably in the first 10 risk evaluations. Among the inconsistencies were differences in whether health conditions related to a chemical\u2019s hazards were considered and whether fenceline communities were included.66,67 For example, fenceline communities were identified as PESS for hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), but not for 1,4-dioxane, 1-bromopropane (1-BP), or C.I. Pigment Violet 29 (PV-29); children were identified as PESS for 1-BP and HBCD, but not for 1,4-dioxane or PV-29.68 To remedy the problem of inconsistent and incomplete identification of PESS, Rayasam et al. recommended that:  EPA should prepare a comprehensive methodology to identify PESS and quantify their risks consistently within and across the TSCA risk evaluations.69  EPA has not yet proposed such a methodology. The consideration of PESS in Table 5-69 and Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation is a useful initial step towards developing a consistent, structured approach to identifying PESS in TSCA risk evaluations. The table gives explicit consideration to each of the following factors that may lead to increased chemical exposures or susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures: lifestage, pre-existing disease, lifestyle activities, occupational and consumer exposures, socio-demographic factors, nutrition, genetics/epigenetics, unique activities, aggregate exposures, and other chemical and non-chemical stressors.  EPA, however, has violated TSCA\u2019s mandate to consider each of the relevant factors in identifying populations groups that \u201cdue to either greater susceptibility or greater exposure, may be at greater risk than the general population of adverse health effects.\u201d70  The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:   65 U.S. EPA (2017).

The effect of these factors on susceptibility to health effects of TCEP is not known; therefore, EPA is uncertain about the magnitude of any possible increased risk from effects associated with TCEP exposure.71  EPA\u2019s default approach seems to be that a susceptible subgroup will not be identified as PESS when there are not chemical-specific quantitative data on the magnitude of increased susceptibility for a given susceptibility factor.  TSCA does not require chemical-specific quantitative data to identify or evaluate risk to PESS; TSCA simply requires EPA to rely on the \u201cbest available science\u201d when evaluating risk to PESS. The best available science demonstrates that both intrinsic factors, which include biological traits like age, genetic makeup, and pre-existing health conditions, and extrinsic factors, which include psychosocial stress from experiencing income inequality, violence, racism, healthcare inequity, or food insecurity, can individually or collectively increase susceptibility to harm from chemical exposures.72 EPA should therefore focus first on identifying susceptible subpopulations based on either chemical-specific evidence or the broader literature on intrinsic and extrinsic susceptibility factors, and then, as a separate step, consider how to account for the elevated risks for each group.  The initial identification of PESS, however, should not be contingent on chemical-specific data to quantify risk for a susceptible subgroup.  Once the appropriate groups are identified as PESS, EPA should then consider the availability of chemical -specific data. When such data are absent, the application of generic adjustment factors (beyond the customary 10x factor for human variability) should be applied to ensure that risks to PESS are not underestimated.73  Lifestage. EPA has appropriately identified infants (exposed from human breast milk), children, male adolescents and pregnant women as PESS. However, infants as PESS should not be restricted to human breast milk exposure, as infants are also likely to be exposed to TCEP via ingestion of household dust (e.g. hand to mouth behaviors). In addition, EPA\u2019s risk evaluation understates the magnitude of human breast milk exposures for some infants by assuming a maximum breastfeeding duration of one year. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) indicate that 37.6 percent of infants born in 2020 were breastfeeding at age 12 months, and 17.3 percent were breastfeeding at age 18 months.74  71 U.S. EPA (2023).

Enhanced susceptibility of infants, children, women of reproductive age and people of age 65 years or older is well-established, and these groups should be identified as PESS for each TSCA risk evaluation, regardless of whether there are chemical-specific data to quantify those differences. Further, EPA makes no adjustments to quantify the enhanced risks to the susceptible lifestages. Instead, EPA applies the customary 10x human variability factor, which is routinely applied in EPA risk assessments and is not sufficient to address human variability in response to chemical exposures.75 EPA acknowledges that \u201cThe magnitude of differences in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics for some individuals may be greater than accounted for by the UFH of 10,\u201d76 but it then continues to apply this insufficient value. The WHO\u2019s International Programme on Chemical Safety (\u201cIPCS\u201d) found that an adjustment factor of approximately 42X is needed to account for the range in human variability in response to chemical exposure when estimating a risk-specific dose intended for a risk of 1% (1-in-100), with larger factors necessary for protection of the population at lower risk levels.77    Pre-existing disease. EPA did not identify any groups as PESS based on pre-existing disease or health conditions. EPA identified neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and kidney toxicity as likely hazards of TCEP, but it disregarded the prevalence in the U.S. population of vulnerabilities to these hazards. For example, the CDC estimates that 14% of U.S. adults have chronic kidney disease; this affects not just older adults, but also 6% of adults ages 18-44 years.78  Given that kidney toxicity is a hazard of TCEP, people with chronic kidney disease should be considered a susceptible subpopulation in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Risk estimation for this group should also incorporate an adjustment factor (in addition to the customary human variability factor) representing the enhanced risk of kidney effects from TCEP exposure. Similarly, population groups with biological susceptibility to the neurotoxic, reproductive and/or developmental effects of TCEP should also be considered PESS, and appropriate adjustments to the estimation of risks of each outcome for these groups should be made.  Individual activities. Subsistence fishers (including tribal populations) are identified as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation based on elevated TCEP exposures. However, no \u201clifestyle\u201d or \u201cindividual\u201d activities are identified for enhanced susceptibility. EPA mentions smoking as a lifestyle factor that could influence susceptibility to chemical exposures, but it failed to identify smokers as PESS because it found no chemical-specific information. Smoking tobacco has numerous biological effects that could enhance susceptibility to the hazards of TCEP, such as adverse effects on the kidney. Smokers should be considered PESS even if there is not direct TCEP-specific evidence. In addition, we recommend using the term \u201cindividual activities\u201d instead of \u201clifestyle activities.\u201d   75 Julia R.

EPA appropriately identified firefighters as an occupational group with elevated TCEP exposures. However, in discussing the relevant evidence, EPA omitted the important 2022 study by Trowbridge et al.79  EPA also failed to consider firefighter exposures in its unreasonable risk determination for TCEP. According to Appendix D of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, firefighter exposures are classified as \u201cbackground\u201d and \u201cEPA did not identify sources of increased COU or pathway specific exposure for firefighters.\u201d80 However, it is highly likely that elevated firefighter exposures arise from the presence of consumer and commercial products containing TCEP in burning structures, and firefighter exposures should be a consideration in EPA\u2019s unreasonable risk determinations for those products. In addition, EPA failed to consider that workers may be occupationally exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse outcomes with TCEP (e.g. neurological, reproductive and kidney effects).  People who experience occupational exposures to other toxic chemicals that are linked to similar adverse health outcomes as TCEP can have enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of TCEP and should be identified and evaluated as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.  Geographic factors.  Geographic factors were not included in Table 5-69 of the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. However, EPA has considered geographic factors as contributors to PESS in previous assessments and appropriately identified fenceline communities near facilities that emit TCEP as PESS in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, so it is unclear why an entry for this factor is omitted from Table 5-69. Although EPA has estimated exposures to fenceline communities, it has not considered the many characteristics that can enhance susceptibility to the effects of TCEP and are common in fenceline communities. In general, people living in fenceline communities are more likely to be people of color and are more likely to experience increased exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors that make them more susceptible to harm, including a broad range of non-chemical stressors like pre-existing disease, racism, and poverty.81 EPA is therefore required under TSCA to account for these enhanced susceptibilities when evaluating risks to fenceline communities.  Socio-demographic factors. The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says \u201cEPA did not evaluate exposure differences between racial groups.\u201d82  At a minimum, EPA should assess the demographic profile of populations living in locations likely to experience elevated exposures (e.g. sites with TCEP in groundwater, sites near facilities producing, using, or disposing of TCEP).  EPA conducted such an analysis for the proposed TSCA risk management rule for trichloroethylene,83 and this approach should be incorporated in all TSCA risk evaluations.  If EPA does not have the data necessary to conduct a robust, accurate, and scientifically-sound environmental justice analysis of chemicals subject to TSCA risk evaluation, it should develop and execute a strategy for obtaining the data and analyzing it.  For example, EPA could use its TSCA authorities to gather information from industry on TCEP manufacturing/processing sites and products containing TCEP. EPA failed to use its authority to list TCEP to the Toxics Release  79 Trowbridge J, Gerona R, McMaster M, Ona K, Clarity C, Bessonneau V , Rudel R, Buren H, Morello-Frosch R (2022).

The TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation says:  EPA did not identify specific evidence that sociodemographic factors influence susceptibility to TCEP although it is known that they can affect susceptibility to disease.84     TSCA requires EPA to account for enhanced susceptibility to chemical exposures in chemical risk evaluations.  EPA must account for socio-demographic factors associated with enhanced susceptibility in its identification of PESS and in analyzing risks to those groups.  For example, people experiencing poverty or racial discrimination may experience psychosocial stress85,86,87,88,89 that can enhance susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Nutrition. EPA correctly states that \u201cNutrition can affect susceptibility to disease generally,\u201d but it did not identify any PESS because it \u201cdid not identify specific evidence that nutritional factors influence susceptibility to TCEP.\u201d90  People with food insecurity or lack of access to nutritious food can experience enhanced susceptibility to the adverse effects of toxic chemicals, including TCEP, and should be identified as PESS even if there is not direct chemical-specific evidence.    Genetics.  EPA states that \u201cgenetic disorders may increase susceptibility to male reproductive effects; this was addressed through a 10\u00d7 UF for human variability.\u201d91  EPA assumes that a 10-fold factor is sufficient to account for human variability in response to chemical exposures, including the impacts of genetics and all the other susceptibility factors in the table, even though the National Academies92 and the WHO93 have both compiled evidence that a larger factor is necessary to ensure public health protection. EPA must accordingly increase the uncertainty factor it uses to account for enhanced susceptibility to TCEP based on genetic disorders.  Aggregate exposures. EPA has only partially accounted for aggregate exposure in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation. EPA aggregated across exposure pathways for consumers and separately for workers, but it did not aggregate exposures for workers who also experience consumer and general population exposures, and did not aggregate exposures for consumers who have  84 U.S. EPA (2023).

EPA says that these exposures were not aggregated because it did not have data indicating such co-exposures. EPA should not require chemical-specific evidence to conduct aggregate exposure evidence. It can reasonably model scenarios in which exposures are combined across products and across worker, consumer and general population exposures. For example, some individuals with occupational exposure to TCEP are likely to live close to where they work and would therefore also be exposed as members of the general population.  Other chemical and non-chemical stressors. EPA\u2019s approach to consideration of other stressors in identifying PESS and accounting for risks to PESS is too narrow. EPA mentions experimental findings of benzo-a-pyrene interactions with TCEP, but does not specifically identify persons with exposure to benzo-a-pyrene as PESS and makes no effort to account for the elevated risks arising from those exposures. Further, EPA does not give any consideration to other chemical stressors that share common adverse outcomes with TCEP.  For example, the draft risk evaluation identifies \u201cdifferences in numbers and degeneration of seminiferous tubules\u201d as the \u201cMost Critical Endpoint\u201d among TCEP non-cancer effects.94 EPA\u2019s 2023 draft document on application of cumulative risk assessment to phthalates under TSCA discusses the extensive experimental evidence of seminiferous tubule atrophy/degeneration from phthalate exposure and finds that it is \u201ca sensitive, adverse effect frequently reported by board certified pathologists.\u201d95     EPA should consider males who experienced prenatal exposure to phthalates as a PESS for the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation to recognize that pre-existing damage to the seminiferous tubules that may have occurred from phthalate exposure would make males more vulnerable to further harm from TCEP exposure. The consequence of early-life phthalate exposure would be that the risks of male reproductive harm would occur at lower TCEP doses than EPA has estimated in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation, and an adjustment factor should be incorporated to account for that increased vulnerability to damage of the seminiferous tubules. In addition, TCEP and phthalates can be used together in polyvinyl chloride,96 further supporting the joint consideration of TCEP and phthalates under TSCA. Direct experimental evidence of joint action of phthalates and TCEP is not necessary; the joint action can be inferred from the evidence of a common adverse outcome. Populations exposed to other chemicals sharing common adverse effects with TCEP should similarly be identified as PESS.    EPA should expand its identification of PESS based on the factors described above and should expand on the approach of Table 5-69 and Appendix D to develop a comprehensive, consistent, and structured methodology for identifying PESS in all TSCA risk evaluations.         94 U.S. EPA (2023).

For risk characteriza?on of non-cancer health e\ufb00ects, the TSCA risk evalua?on calculates a \u201cmargin of exposure\u201d (MOE) for each exposure scenario, which is the ra?o of the point of departure (POD) to the exposure level.  For the TCEP male reproduc?ve e\ufb00ects, the TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on concludes that an MOE of 30 or more indicates that \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern.\u201d97  EPA\u2019s approach to risk characteriza?on does not actually es?mate risks of adverse e\ufb00ects in the popula?on with chronic exposure to TCEP, but instead simply applies a \u201cbright line\u201d judgment of whether or not the MOE is adequate.  A more informa?ve approach for both risk characteriza?on and risk management would be to apply the probabilis?c dose-response assessment methods of the Interna?onal Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS),98 part of the World Health Organiza?on (WHO), to es?mate the risk of adverse e\ufb00ects at various levels of exposure.  The IPCS methodology has previously been described and applied in several peer-reviewed journal ar?cles.99,100,101,102,103    We applied the IPCS approach for \u201cquantal-determinis?c\u201d endpoints and the \u201capproximate probabilis?c\u201d calcula?on (see IPCS report Fig 3.5, panel C)104 to es?mate risks of reduced numbers of seminiferous tubules from chronic oral and inhala?on exposure to TCEP .  The analysis involved the following steps: 1. Derivation of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments 2. Application of study duration adjustments 3. Application of interspecies adjustments 4. Application of intraspecies adjustments 5. Calculation of HDMI - the human dose (HD) of TCEP associated with a particular magnitude of effect M at a particular population incidence I.   For each aspect of the analysis, including the values used to derive the IPCS POD and the adjustment factors applied to derive the HDMI, the IPCS methodology uses a 50th percen?le value (P50) as a central es?mate and the ra?o of 95th percen?le to 50th percen?le (P95/P50) as a measure of uncertainty.  All POD and HDMI values presented in this analysis are for con?nuous exposures.  We demonstrate each of these steps star?ng with the EPA oral exposure POD to derive a set of oral HDMI values for di\ufb00erent levels of popula?on incidence, then discuss deriva?on of a corresponding set of inhala?on exposure HDMI values.    97 U.S. EPA (2023).

Guidance document on evaluating and expressing uncertainty in hazard characterization, 2nd edition. \n    \n 24  STEP 1:  Deriva?on of IPCS POD and corresponding uncertainty adjustments  The IPCS methodology requires the use of an ED50 (median e\ufb00ec?ve dose) value as the POD for quantal-determinis?c endpoints.  Since an ED50 is not available from the EPA risk evalua?on, we began with EPA\u2019s benchmark dose, lower con\ufb01dence limit (BMDL) and applied adjustments provided by the IPCS methodology.  At the same ?me, we incorporated quan?ta?ve uncertain?es for each of these adjustments.  EPA used a benchmark response (BMR) of 5% to derive the BMDL for decreased numbers of  seminiferous tubules from TCEP exposure.  The chronic oral non-cancer BMDL05 value expressed as a human equivalent dose (HED) is 2.73 mg/kg-d.105      The \ufb01rst POD adjustment in the IPCS methodology is to convert the BMDL05 to a BMD05 as follows:  BMD05(HED) = BMDL05(HED) x (BMD05 / BMDL05)  This adjustment is used because the Dra) TCEP Risk Evalua1on does not report the BMD05 as an HED.  However, both the BMD05 and BMDL05 are available in terms of the animal dosage, before deriva?on of the HED, and can be used for computa?on of the BMD05 / BMDL05 ra?o.  The necessary values for this ra?o were obtained from EPA\u2019s supplemental \ufb01le of BMD modeling results,106 and the ra?o calculated as follows:    BMD05 / BMDL05 = 28.8 / 20.8 = 1.38  The BMD05(HED) is then:  BMD05(HED) = 2.73 mg/kg-d x 1.38 = 3.77 mg/kg-d  In the IPCS methodology, uncertainty in the BMD is represented by the P95/P50 ra?o, which is equal to the same ra?o of BMD / BMDL, or 1.38.    The second POD adjustment is to convert from the BMD to an ED50.  The ED50 and its uncertainty are determined by applying the following conversion from Chiu et al. 2018:  \u201cif ED50 not reported: BMD at the reported BMR is mul?plied by an addi?onal factor of 3.0; addi?onal uncertainty through adding 1.52 to (P95/P50)2.\u201d107  The median (P50) es?mate of the ED50 is then derived by mul?plying the BMDL05(HED) by the two adjustment factors (P50).  The uncertainty adjustments (P95/P50) for each POD aspect are combined into a composite P95/P50 value.  In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template, those values are entered as follows:    105 U.S. EPA (2023).

Since the determination of the EPA BMDL05 values incorporate dosimetric adjustments, no further adjustment for body size is necessary (P50 = 1).  The uncertainty in the bodyweight scaling is not quantified in this analysis (P95/P50 = 1).    For the TK/TD di\ufb00erences remaining afer bodyweight scaling, the IPCS report recommends a central es?mate (P50) of 1 (i.e., no addi?onal interspecies di\ufb00erences) and represen?ng uncertainty with a P95/P50 factor of 3.112  We incorporated these IPCS recommenda?ons, which are entered In the IPCS approximate probabilis?c calcula?on template as follows:  Interspecies adjustments (AFInterspecies) for probabilisDc  dose-response analysis of chronic TCEP exposure Aspect P50 P95/P50 AFInterspecies-BS 1 1 AFInterspecies-TK/TD 1 3  Step 4:  Applica?on of intraspecies (human variability) adjustments   In the IPCS methodology, the value of the human variability adjustment factor (AFintraspecies) varies depending on the incidence of the adverse e\ufb00ect in the exposed popula?on \u2013 with a larger adjustment factor necessary to extrapolate from the POD to lower levels of incidence.  The IPCS report provides AFintraspecies for several incidence (I) values.

The corresponding values for inhala?on exposure can be derived in two ways, which each provide the same results: 1. Multiply oral HDMI values by a factor of 5.44 mg/m3 per mg/kg-d.  This factor is obtained from information provided in the TCEP Draft Risk Evaluation.113 2. Replace EPA\u2019s oral BMDL05 (2.73 mg/kg-d) in the above tables with EPA\u2019s inhalation BMDL05 (14.9 mg/m3) and recalculate the ED50 and the HDMI values using the same adjustments.   The National Academies and the WHO/IPCS have both recommended using the lower confidence limit (LCL) on a probabilistic dose-response distribution for use in decision-making, in place of a traditional reference dose (RfD) or reference concentration (RfC). The National Academies said in Science and Decisions that:  multiple risk-specific doses could be provided\u2026in the various risk characterizations that EPA produces to aid environmental decision-making.114    113 U.S. EPA (2023). Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP), p. 530, Equation_Apx J-3. 114 National Research Council (2009). Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 140. \n    \n 34 A Risk-Specific Reference Dose: For quantal effects, the RfD can be defined to be the dose that corresponds to a particular risk specified to be de minimis (for example, 1 in 100,000) at a defined confidence level (for example, 95%) for the toxicity end point of concern.115  The WHO/IPCS said:   the LCL of the HDMI can be used as a probabilis?c RfD to replace the determinis?c RfD. In this case, the probabilis?c RfD is the dose that protects the popula?on from a speci\ufb01ed magnitude and incidence of e\ufb00ect with a pre-speci\ufb01ed per cent coverage (con\ufb01dence).116  Consistent with the guidance from the Na?onal Academies and the IPCS, we summarize the above results in the following table of the lower con\ufb01dence limit (5th percen?le or P05) risk-speci\ufb01c doses (HDMI) for mul?ple levels of risk (incidence or I), for both oral and inhala?on exposures.

Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, p. 140. 116 World Health Organization, International Programme on Chemical Safety (2017). Guidance document on evaluating and expressing uncertainty in hazard characterization, 2nd edition, p. 12. \n    \n 35 \u2022 0.02 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose and 0.10 mg/m3 is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.1% of the population. \u2022 0.008 mg/kg-d is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human oral dose and 0.04 mg/m3 is the lower bound (95% confidence) chronic human inhalation dose at which male reproductive effects are expected in 0.01% (1-in-10,000) of the population. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for oral exposure to TCEP uses 2.73 mg/kg-d as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.117 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d118 for any chronic oral exposure less than 2.73 mg/kg-d / 30 = 0.09 mg/kg-d. Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an oral exposure of 0.09 mg/kg-d is 2.5%, or 1-in-40. \u2022 EPA\u2019s non-cancer risk characterization for inhalation exposure to TCEP uses 14.9 mg/m3 as the point of departure, and a benchmark MOE of 30.119 This means that EPA concludes \u201cthe risk is not considered to be of concern\u201d120 for any chronic inhalation exposure less than 14.9 mg/m3 / 30 = 0.50 mg/m3. Our analysis finds that the upper bound risk at an inhalation exposure of 0.50 mg/m3 is 2.5%, or 1-in-40.  The es?mates of HDMI presented here were based en?rely on input values and equa?ons available from the WHO/IPCS methodology document and from EPA\u2019s TCEP Dra) Risk Evalua1on.  An important caveat to these calcula?ons is that the values used to represent human variability may be understated.  The IPCS default human variability distribu?on is based on 37 data sets for human toxicokine?c variability and 34 data sets for human toxicodynamic variability.   Most of these data sets were obtained from controlled human exposure studies of pharmaceu?cals conducted in small samples of healthy adults, represen?ng considerably less variability than found in the general popula?on.121,122,123 If human variability is underes?mated, then the actual dose associated with each incidence level (e.g. I =1%, I = 0.1%) will be lower than the values obtained from this analysis \u2013 or in other words, risk at each dose will be underes?mated.       \n 117 U.S. EPA (2023).

TCEP is found in fu rniture and textiles, insulation and flooring, \nbaby carriers and car seats, and other widely us ed products. It contamin ates indoor and outdoor \nair, drinking water supplies, and fish and wildli fe. When materials containing TCEP are disposed \nof or recycled, TCEP\u2014and sometimes other high ly toxic byproducts\u2014are released from waste \nincinerators, recycling fa cilities, and landfills and can leach out of recycled-content products.   \nTSCA requires EPA to comprehensively evalua te TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks, including \nrisks to subpopulations who expe rience greater risk than the ge neral population because they \nhave greater exposures or are more  susceptible to harm from TCEP.2  Where, as here, EPA finds \nunreasonable risk, it must regulate the chemical \u201ct o the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents such risk.\u201d3 The draft risk evaluation, while co rrectly finding that TCEP presents \nunreasonable risk to human health and the environment, fails to consider the full ex tent of those \nrisks and deprives EPA of the information it need s to ensure the protection of public health and \nthe environment. \n1 EPA, EPA-740-D-23-002, Draft Risk Evaluation for Tris (2-chloroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP)   \n(Dec. 2023) (\u201cDraft TCEP Risk Evaluation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n12/tcep_draft_risk_evalua tion_20231207_hero_pub lic-release.pdf.  \n2 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A) (requiring EPA to evalua te chemicals\u2019 risks to  \u201cpotentially exposed \nor susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d); id. \u00a7 2602(12) (defining \u201cpotential ly exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d). \n3 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). EXHIBIT F\n2 First, despite EPA\u2019s mandate to conduct ri sk evaluations using the \u201cbest available \nscience,\u201d4 EPA disregards the broad scientific consensus that flame retardants like TCEP should \nbe evaluated and regulated as a class, as expr essly authorized by TSCA . While other agencies, \nstates, and scientific bodies ar e actively pursuing that recommended class-based approach, EPA \nevaluates TCEP\u2019s exposures and risks in isol ation, understating the ch emical\u2019s real-world \nimpacts and inviting the substitution of one  toxic flame retardant for another.   \nSecond, EPA unlawfully excludes multiple conditions of use from its TCEP risk \ndetermination, claiming that it lacks the info rmation needed to evaluate them. But TSCA \nrequires EPA to assess the risks a ssociated with all of a chemical\u2019s conditions of use and to \ncollect or generate the information it needs to do so. Here, not only has EPA failed to use \nTSCA\u2019s information collection auth orities to fill asserted data gaps, it also denied a petition \nseeking additional testing of TCEP  by asserting that such testi ng was not necessary and that EPA \ncould evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks adequately using existing data and models . Most problematically, \nEPA fails to use reasonably available informatio n to calculate the full risks from TCEP disposal, \none of the chemical\u2019s most sign ificant conditions of use.   \nThird, for the conditions of use that it does consider, EPA repeated ly understates TCEP\u2019s \nexposures and risks. EPA relies on unsupported assu mptions about exposure  rates and durations, \nignores the impact of background exposures to TCEP, improperly discounts the studies that \ndemonstrate the greatest hazards, and disreg ards its own guidance concerning the use of \nuncertainty factors. Compounding those flaws, EPA violates TS CA\u2019s mandate to evaluate \nTCEP\u2019s risks to potentially e xposed or susceptible subpopulat ions, including people who are \nexposed to TCEP from multiple conditions of us e and exposure pathways and routes, or who are \nmore susceptible to harm because of their exposures to multiple flame retardants that can \nexacerbate the risks from TCEP. EPA also undere stimates risks to tr ibal populations who \nexperience increased TCEP exposures not only fro m the consumption of contaminated fish but \nalso from other subsistence foods and from heig htened exposure associ ated with inadequate \nwaste management infrastructure  and open burning of solid wast e, among other pathways. EPA \nsubstantially understates TC EP\u2019s risks to wildlife and fails to consider the chemical\u2019s effects on \nthreatened and endangered species and other sp ecies of special conser vation concern. Finally, \nEPA relies on vague and underprotective unreasonable risk thresholds that  would leave workers, \nconsumers, and fenceline communities exposed to unacceptable harm.   \nWe acknowledge and appreciate the work that went into EPA\u2019s draft risk evaluation, \nwhich does improve on prior risk ev aluations in several respects. EPA correctly identifies tribal \npopulations as a potentially expos ed or susceptible subpopulati on, recognizes the increased \nexposures and risks tribal popula tions often face from fish consumption, and calculates those \ndietary exposures using bot h contemporary and heritage tribal fish consumption rates. EPA also \nconsiders aggregate risks to certain populations  who are exposed from multiple exposure routes, \na legally required analysis that EPA has negl ected in the past. But EPA cannot adequately \nevaluate the risks associat ed with TCEP, or protect the people who are exposed to it, if it persists \nin ignoring 30 percent of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e and systematically un derstates the risks from \n4 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n3 the other 70 percent. TSCA require s EPA to evaluate the risks fro m all of TCEP\u2019s conditions of \nuse, to all potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations, so EPA has the information it needs \nto fully eliminate TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. We urge EPA to revise its risk evaluation, as set \nforth in greater detail below, so it compli es with those statut ory requirements.   \nI. EPA Cannot Meaningfully Evaluate or Su ccessfully Regulate Individual Flame\nRetardants in Isolation\nOrganohalogen flame retardants (\u201cOFRs\u201d), in cluding TCEP, are added to furniture and\ntextiles, furniture foam and vehicle cushioning, building and construction materials, and a broad \nrange of other products.5 Because they are \u201cmixed into but not chemically bonded to materials, \n[they] can leach out of products\u201d and into people, wildlife, and the environment.6 Ninety-seven \npercent of people in the Unite d States have at least one flame retardant in their blood,7 and 75 \npercent of people tested in one study had a TCEP metabolite in their urine.8   \nPeople are routinely exposed to, and harm ed by, combinations of OFRs in their \nworkplaces, homes, and communities. Multiple fl ame retardants, including TCEP, have been \ndetected in household dust,9 college dormitories,10 daycare centers and nurseries,11 and a range of \nwildlife species.12 Multiple OFRs, including TCEP, are also associated with an increased risk of \ncancer, reproductive harm, and othe r overlapping health effects.13 Evaluating the individual \n5 See, e.g.,  Joseph A.

In the 1970s and 1980s, polyc hlorinated biphenyls \n(\u201cPCBs\u201d) and polybrominated biphenyls (\u201cPBBs\u201d) were widely used as flame retardants until \nthey were found to cause cancer and other severe environmental and health impacts.15 The \nregulation of PCB and PBB flame retardants resulted in the in creased use of polybrominated \ndiphenyl ethers (\u201cPBDEs\u201d), which were later fo und to cause reproductive , developmental, and \nneurodevelopmental harm.16 Even within the PBDE subcla ss, chemical manufacturers often \nresponded to regulation of a particular chemic al by making minor chan ges to its underlying \nchemistry and replacing it with a closel y related, similarly toxic substitute.17 As phaseouts of \nPBDEs began in the 1990s, industry turned to harmful organophosphate ester flame retardants \nlike TCEP, tripentyl phosphate (\u201cTPP\u201d), a nd tris(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate (\u201cTDBPP\u201d).18  \nEven now, as production of TCEP has decrease d in recent years, other organophosphate ester \nflame retardants like 2-Propanol, 1-chloro-,  2,2\u2019,2\u2019\u2019-phosphate (\u201cTCPP\u201d) and 2-Propanol, 1,3-\ndichloro-, phosphate (3:1) (\u201cTDCPP\u201d ) have emerged as replacements.19 As the United Nations \n \nConsumer Product Safety Commission (Sept. 14, 2014), \nhttps://greenscience policy.org/docs/eastmond-cpsc- supporting-materials-14-09-15.pdf .  \n14 See infra Point VI.B. \n15 Barbara Hales & Shirra Freeman, Nat\u2019l Collaborating Ctr. for Env\u2019t Health, Regrettable \nReplacements: The Case of Chemical Flame Retardants  (July 8, 2020), \nhttps://ncceh.ca/resources/evidence-briefs/reg rettable-replacements -case-chemical-flame-\nretardants . \n16 Id.; Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry (\u201cATSDR\u201d), Toxicological Profile for \nPolybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs)  11\u201326 (Mar. 2017) (\u201cTox Profile for PBDEs\u201d), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp207.pdf . \n17 Martin Sharkey et al., Phasing-Out of Legacy Brominated Flame Retardants: The UNEP \nStockholm Convention and Other Legislative Action Worldwide , 144 Env\u2019t Int\u2019l 106041, at *3 \n(2020) (\u201cPenta- and Octa- BDE commercial mixtures were liste d in the Stockholm Convention \nin 2004, while Deca-BDE\u2014used as a replacem ent for Penta-/Octa-BDEs in several \napplications\u2014was listed much later, in 2019.\u201d). \n18 Arlene Blum et al., Organophosphate Ester Flame Retardan ts: Are They a Regrettable \nSubstitution for Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers? , 6 Env\u2019t Sci. & Tech Letters 638, 639 (2019). \n19 See EPA, EPA-740-R1-5001, TSCA Work Plan Chemical Pr oblem Formulation and Initial \nAssessment: Chlorinated Phosphate Ester Cluster Flame Retardants  at 11 (Aug. 2015) (\u201cTSCA \nProblem Formulation\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-\n09/documents/cpe_fr_clus ter_problem_formulation.pdf  (\u201c[A]lthough commercial uses of TCEP \nas a flame retardant were declining . . .

The National Academies \nhave found that a class-based approach would \u201cmake regulatory hazard and risk assessment \nmuch more efficient\u201d and \u201cbegin to . . . addres s[]\u201d the \u201cproblem of re grettable substitution,\u201d \nmaking it \u201cthe only possible practic al approach for a set of che micals as large as the OFRs.\u201d30 A \nclass-based risk evaluation would also facilitate the considerati on of cumulative risk, as the \nNational Academies and EPA\u2019s Science Advi sory Committee on Chemicals (\u201cSACC\u201d) have \nconsistently called for.31 Recognizing the benefits of a multiple-chemical assessment, in 2014 \nEPA commenced a TSCA risk assessment for TCEP along with two st ructurally similar \nphosphate ester flame retardants that were \u201cincreasing[ly used] as substitutes for TCEP.\u201d32 And \nEPA and other governmental aut horities have long evaluated other organohalogen chemicals\u2014\nsuch as PCBs, organophosphate pesticides (\u201cOPs\u201d ), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances \n(\u201cPFAS\u201d)\u2014by class because of their sh ared toxicity and persistence. \nThere is no legal or scientific basis for EPA to reject this \u201cmovement toward a class \napproach\u201d and to evaluate the ri sks posed by TCEP in isolation.33 In addition to violating TSCA\u2019s \n\u201cbest available science\u201d requirement, EPA\u2019s propos ed approach is a poor use of the Agency\u2019s \nlimited resources. EPA should not spend years on the evaluation and management of TCEP\u2019s \nrisks only to see TCEP replaced by TCPP, TDCPP, and other toxic flame retardants that EPA has \nnot targeted for TSCA regulation. To fully acc ount for TCEP\u2019s risks and minimize the likelihood \nof regrettable substitutions, we urge EPA to: (1 ) evaluate the cumulative risks from exposures to \nTCEP and other flame retardants, as set forth in greater detail below,34 and (2) pursue a class-\nbased evaluation of OFRs or identified OFR subclasses, which include k nown TCEP substitutes. \n26 See List of State or Local La ws Banning Organohalogen Flame Retardants in Upholstered \nFurniture (Sept. 22, 2022) (attached as Exhibit A ). \n27 ATSDR, Toxicological Profile for P hosphate Ester Flame Retardants  (Sept. 2012), \nhttps://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp202.pdf . \n28 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625(c). \n29 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n30 NASEM OFRs Approach at 4, 6.  \n31 See infra Point VI.B . \n32 TSCA Problem Formulation at 11.  \n33 NASEM OFRs Approach at 6. \n34 See infra Point VI.B.  \n7 II. EPA Appropriately Found That TCEP Pres ents Unreasonable Risk to Human\nHealth and the Environment\nThe draft risk evaluation appropriately concludes that \u201cTCEP presents unreasonable risks\nto human health and the environment.\u201d35 While EPA overlooks and underestimates many of \nTCEP\u2019s risks, its finding that  TCEP presents unreasonable risk  is well supported by the record. \nTCEP is associated with an increased risk  of cancer, neurological  harm, and reproductive \nharm, as well as other serious health and environmental effects.36 According to EPA\u2019s own \nestimates, nearly every occ upational condition of use presen ts unreasonable cancer risks, \nincluding risks as high as 6.9-in-100 from worker s\u2019 dermal exposure to TCEP in paints and \ncoatings alone.37 Inhalation of TCEP from roofing insu lation presents a 4.5-in-100 cancer risk, \nmore than 40,000 times higher than EPA\u2019s standard 1-in-1,000,000 unreasonable risk \nbenchmark.38 TCEP has been widely used in car seats, nursing pillows, and baby toys, and EPA \ncalculated reproductive risks fr om infants\u2019 mouthing of TCEP -containing blocks that are 30 \ntimes worse than the Agency\u2019s accepted benchmark level.39 TCEP presents particularly severe \nrisks to tribal communities, including a greater than 1-in -10 cancer risk from  the consumption of \nTCEP-contaminated fish alone.40 Finally, EPA also calculated un reasonable risks to aquatic life \nfrom multiple uses of TCEP, some of which we re up to 30 times greate r than EPA\u2019s benchmark \nRisk Quotient (\u201cRQ\u201d) of 1.0.41 \nWhile those calculations fail to capture the full extent of TCEP\u2019s risks, the draft risk \nevaluation does contain several important improvements from EPA\u2019s prior TSCA risk \nevaluations. Among them: \n\uf0b7EPA made a risk determination for TCEP as  a whole chemical, as required by TSCA\u2019s\nmandate \u201cto determine whether a chemical s ubstance presents an unreasonable risk of\ninjury to health or the environment.\u201d42\n\uf0b7EP\nA calculated the aggregate risks to consumers who are exposed to TCEP from multiple\nexposure routes,43 although it failed to consider aggreg ate risks to workers, to the general\npopulation, and to people who were expos ed from multiple conditions of use.44\n\uf0b7EP\nA evaluated TCEP\u2019s risks to fenceline co mmunities, a legally re quired analysis that\nEPA nonetheless excluded from its fi rst ten TSCA risk evaluations.45\n35 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n36 Id. at 250\u201385. \n37 Id. at 302. \n38 Id. at 310. \n39 Id. at 308. \n40 Id. at 321. \n41 Id. at 132. \n4215 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). \n43 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 338\u201340. \n44 See infra Point VI.A . \n45 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 205\u201306. \n8 \uf0b7EPA correctly identified tribal populations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible\nsubpopulation\u201d46 whose risks EPA must specifically consider, acknowledged that tribal\npopulations\u2019 distinctive cultures and lifewa ys give rise to many unique exposure\nscenarios and increased exposures to chemi cals such as TCEP, and calculated exposure\nand risk associated with one such scenario\u2014fish consumption.\nIII. EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate All of TCEP\u2019s Conditions of Use\nA.EPA\u2019s Risk Calculations and Unreasonabl e Risk Determination Exclude Six of\nTCEP\u2019s Twenty Identified Conditions of Use\nWhile the draft risk evaluation identifie s 20 conditions of use for TCEP, EPA only \ndetermines the risks associated  with 14 of them. For the re maining six conditions of use\u2014\ncommercial use of fabric and textile products , commercial use of fo am seating and bedding \nproducts, commercial use of  wood resin composites, commercial use of insulation, consumer use \nof paints and coatings, and di sposal (collectively, the \u201cUna ssessed Conditions of Use\u201d)\u2014EPA \nclaims that it \u201cdoes not have sufficient information to determ ine whether they contribute to \nTCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks.\u201d47 \nEPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the risks associat ed with those conditions of use violates \nmultiple provisions of TSCA. First and foremo st, TSCA section 6(b) requires EPA to \u201cconduct \nrisk evaluations . . . to determin e whether a chemical substance pr esents an unreasonable risk . . . \nunder the conditions of use.\u201d48 It is well established that when the word \u201cthe\u201d precedes a \ncollective or plural noun, such as \u201cconditions of use,\u201d it is equivalent to \u201call.\u201d49 TSCA therefore \nrequires EPA to \u201cdetermine\u201d the risks associated w ith a chemical under all of the \u201ccircumstances \n. . . under which a chemical substance is in tended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be \nmanufactured, processed, distributed  in commerce, used, or dispos ed of,\u201d which EPA concedes it \ndid not do for the Unassessed Conditions of Use.50 As EPA and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit have both recogni zed, the plain text of TSCA and of EPA\u2019s implementing \nregulations \u201cunambiguously do not  grant EPA the discretion\u201d to exclude conditions  of use from a \n46 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A), (F). \n47 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. In additi on to the Unassessed Conditions of Use, EPA \nfailed to measure the risks associated with ot her conditions of use, such as recycling, but \nnonetheless asserted that those uses would not contribute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable risks. As \ndescribed below, those conclusory determinations also violate TSCA. See infra  Point IV .E. \n48 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(A). TSCA defines \u201cconditions of use\u201d as \u201cthe circumstances . . . under \nwhich a chemical substance is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, \nprocessed, distributed in commer ce, used, or disposed of.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2602(4). \n49 See, e.g., Dutcher v. Matheson , 840 F.3d 1183, 1194 (10th Cir. 2016); Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. \nIns. Co ., 561 F.3d 144, 155 (3d Cir. 2009); Frazier v. Pioneer Ams.

The draft risk evaluation thus \ndeprives EPA of the information and analysis that it needs to satisfy TSCA\u2019s risk management \nrequirements. Even if risks from certain Unassessed Conditions of Use \u201care expected to be lower \nthan those associated with [conditions of use] already quantified,\u201d53 as EPA claims, EPA would \nstill need to evaluate those conditions of use to address the risks pres ented by \u201cany combination \nof\u201d TCEP\u2019s uses.54 TSCA\u2019s mandate to \u201cdetermine whether a chemical substance presents an \nunreasonable risk . . . under the conditions of us e\u201d does not permit EPA to stop looking as soon \nas it identifies some unreasonabl e risk from some condition of use.55 Instead, EPA must evaluate \nthe full extent of a chemical\u2019s risks under al l its conditions of use,  individually and in \ncombination.   \nThird, EPA\u2019s failure to evaluate the Una ssessed Conditions of Use violates TSCA\u2019s \nrequirement to \u201ctake into consideration informa tion . . . that is reas onably available to the \nAdministrator\u201d when conducting risk evaluations.56 EPA\u2019s regulations define \u201creasonably \navailable information\u201d to include  not only information in EPA\u2019s possession but also \u201cinformation \nthat EPA . . . can reasonably generate, obtain, and synthesize for use in risk evaluations, \nconsidering the deadlines specified in TSCA.\u201d57 Congress provided EPA up to three-and-a-half \nyears to complete a TSCA risk evaluation, followi ng a year-long prioritiza tion process, precisely \n \n51 Safer Chems., Healthy Fams. v.

EPA also failed to add TCEP  to the Toxics Release Inventory (\u201cTRI\u201d) until \n2023\u2014too late to generate release information fo r the draft risk evaluation\u2014and to lower the \nreporting threshold for the Che mical Data Reporting (\u201cCDR\u201d) ru le and eliminate reporting \nloopholes that allow TCEP manuf acturers and importers to av oid reporting. EPA\u2019s failure to \ncollect information that it claims is needed to ev aluate TCEP \u201cstands in th e face of its significant \nstatutory authority to require that this informat ion be reported . . . and runs contrary to its \nobligation to collect r easonably available information to in form and facilitate its regulatory \nobligations under TSCA.\u201d60 \n While TSCA\u2019s prioritization and risk eval uation deadlines provide d ample time for EPA \nto collect the informatio n it needs to fully evaluate TCEP, in  this case EPA has known of TCEP\u2019s \nlikely risks and data gaps for far longer.  EPA added TCEP to the TSCA Work Plan\u2014a list of \nchemicals that EPA has identified  for future assessment\u2014in 2012.61 In 2014, EPA initiated a risk \nassessment for TCEP and two other chlo rinated phosphate ester flame retardants.62 The following \nyear, EPA released a Problem Fo rmulation and Initial Assessment  for that flame retardant cluster, \nwhich identified several \u201cdata gap[s]\u201d that are \u201cn ecessary to evaluate\u201d the full scope of TCEP\u2019s \nrisks.63 To fill those identified gaps, in 2017 Ea rthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, and other public interest organizations petitioned EPA to require  additional testing of \nTCEP.64  Of relevance here, the petit ion sought (1) \u201ctesting . . . to estimate . . . exposures from \ndisposal facilities in the U.S.,\u201d including e nvironmental monitoring ar ound municipal landfills, \n(2) \u201ctesting . . . to estimate . . . exposures from  recycling facilities in the U.S.,\u201d including \n \n58 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(G). \n59 Id. \u00a7 2610(c); see also id. \u00a7\u00a7 2603(a), 2607(b). \n60 Asbestos Disease Awareness Org. v.

But TSCA requires EPA to use \u201creas onably available informa tion\u201d to evaluate all  of \nTCEP\u2019s conditions of use, as EPA promised to do  in 2017. To the extent that EPA lacks chemical-\nspecific exposure data for certain conditions of us e, EPA can use data from other flame retardants \nwith similar uses or, if needed, model exposur es based on reasonable and health protective \nassumptions.69 EPA cannot, however, rely on its own inacti on over the last decade to excuse its \nfailure to conduct the risk evaluation required by TSCA.  \nB.EPA Has Not Adequately Assessed the Risks to Health and the Environment from\nTCEP Disposal\nTSCA requires EPA to comprehensively evaluate  the risks to health and the environment \nfrom TCEP disposal and determine whether dispos al contributes to the chemical\u2019s unreasonable \nrisks. As discussed above, the statute is clear that a risk evaluation must address all of a \nchemical\u2019s \u201cconditions of use,\u201d70 which include the \u201ccircumstances  . . . under which a chemical \nsubstance is intended, known, or reasonabl y foreseen to be . . . disposed of.\u201d71 Contrary to this \nstatutory mandate, EPA asserts in  the draft risk evaluation that  it \u201cdoes not have sufficient \n65 Id. at 15\u201317. \n66 Chlorinated Phosphate Ester (CPE) Cluster; TSCA Section 21 Petition; Reasons for Agency \nResponse, 82 Fed.

As noted, EPA asserts that \u201cw aste disposal (landfill or \nincineration, [is] covered in each [condition of use/occupational exposure s cenario]\u201d addressed in \nthe risk evaluation, \u201cas opposed to a separate [condition of use].\u201d78 This approach is flawed, first, \nbecause it inherently fails to capture the full extent of disposal-related exposures for people \nworking in disposal facilities and people living near those facilities.  Facilities such as landfills \nand incinerators likely receive TCEP-containing wastes generated through multiple conditions of \nuse. Accordingly, people who work in, or liv e near, a facility processing or holding TCEP-\ncontaining wastes will not  just experience exposure associated with a single use of TCEP. It is \nirrational for EPA to \u201cconsider\u201d disposal-related releases and exposures in  the context of single \nconditions of use as this is not  how relevant populations will actually be exposed. In addition, \nEPA\u2019s approach is flawed because it omits major categories of TCEP disposal, including disposal \nvia wastewater discharges and disposal of imported articles.79 Further, for many of the conditions \n72 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 21. \n73 Id. at 47. \n74 See id.  at 22, 147, 175\u201376 (discussing use of TCEP in aerospace equipment and products, \npaints, construction material s, building insulation, matt resses, and furniture).  \n75 Id. at 42. \n76 Id. at 436; see also id.  at 42 (\u201cWhen used as an additive, TCEP is added to manufactured \nmaterials via physical mixing rather than chemical bonding and as a result, TCEP can easily \nleach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d). \n77 Id. at 19, 39, 84. \n78 Id. at 47. \n79 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating limited subset of conditions of use for which associated disposals \nwere assessed). \n13 \n of use for which EPA purported to consider a ssociated disposals, EPA made no attempt to \nquantify disposal-related releases  or exposures and there is no indication of whether or how EPA \nactually incorporated any \u201cqualitative\u201d assessment of these re leases and exposures into its risk \ndeterminations.80 \nEPA\u2019s failure to quantify releases of TCEP associated with wastewater discharges is \nespecially concerning. EPA acknowledges that TC EP is widely detected in surface and \ngroundwater samples, is not effe ctively removed by conventional dr inking water or wastewater \ntreatment, and is released into  the environment through wastew ater effluent and landfill \nleachate.81 EPA observes that \u201cTCEP was among the 10 most frequently found compounds in a \nstudy that collected wastewater fro m multiple sites in the Research  Triangle Park area of North \nCarolina between 2002 and 2005,\u201d and that TCEP a nd other flame retardants \u201cwere measured \nprimarily at sites downstream from municipal wastewater discharges.\u201d82 EPA further notes that \n\u201c[l]aundry wastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastew ater treatment plant influent \nand subsequently to the aquatic environment.\u201d83 Yet EPA fails to utilize readily available data to \nestimate the volume of these releases. These data include multiple sampling studies that \nmeasured TCEP concentrations in wastewater  treatment plant discharges in Los Angeles\u2014\nstudies that EPA itself, as well as the Nationa l Marine Fisheries Service (\u201cNMFS\u201d) previously \nutilized to assess risks to wildlife prot ected under the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d).84 In \naddition, the Washington Department of Ecol ogy recently measured high concentrations of \nTCEP in wastewater discharges from aerosp ace/aircraft modificati on, industrial laundry, \nshipbuilding, and food processing facili ties, as well as in  landfill leachate.85  \n \n80 See id.  at 46\u201347 (indicating that EPA did not quantify releases or  exposures from disposals \nassociated with numerous commercial uses of TCEP); id. at 49 (acknowledging that \u201cthere may \nbe TCEP releases to the environment via the de molition and disposal of consumer articles, as \nwell as to wastewater via domestic laundry,\u201d but claiming that \u201cEPA  did not have enough \ninformation to assess [these] environmental releases quantitatively\u201d); id. at 51\u201352. \n81 Id. at 39, 42, 45. \n82 Id. at 149, 188. \n83 Id. at 75.  \n84 See Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., Endangered Species Act (ESA) Section 7(a)(2) Biological \nOpinion and Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Consultation and Management Act Essential Fish Habitat Response  80 (Mar. 2022), https://repository. library.noaa.gov/view /noaa/37544; EPA \nRegion 9, Biological Evaluation and Esse ntial Fish Habitat Assessm ent for Discharges to the \nPacific Ocean from Outfalls Associated w ith the City of Los Angeles Hyperion Water \nReclamation Plant and Wastew ater Collection Systems  at 7, 21 (Jan. 2023), \nhttps://repository .library.noaa.gov/ view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.38 of PDF); Los Angeles \nSanitation, Hyperion Treatment Plant and Te rminal Island Water Reclamation Plant Special \nStudy Final Report, Constituents of Emerging Concern (CECs) Special Study  at 5, 7\u20138 (Apr. \n2020), https://repository.libr ary.noaa.gov/view/noaa/49053  (scroll to p.161 of PDF).  \n85 Siana Wong, Wash.

The study also \n \n14 \n It is unclear why EPA failed to utilize these da ta, in combination with information that is \nreferenced in the draft risk ev aluation, to estimate TCEP releases associated with municipal \nwastewater treatment plant discharg es and direct industrial discharg es. It is similarly unclear why \nEPA could not quantify releases fr om landfills and incinera tors. As to landfills, EPA claims it is \nimpossible to produce such estima tes \u201c[w]ithout a full characteri zation of non-hazardous landfill \n. . . conditions and historical wastes . . . around the country.\u201d86 But EPA modeled TCEP releases \nfrom landfills,87 and more recent data on organophosphate flame retardants in landfill leachate \nare available and could be combined with the da ta cited in the draft risk evaluation to better \ncharacterize environmental releases  of TCEP in landfill leachate.88 EPA\u2019s assertion that \u201c[s]ource \nattribution of the consumer uses to the leach ing concentration exhibited . . . [in the risk \nevaluation] are not available, \u201d purportedly precluding a dete rmination of whether \u201cthese \nconcentrations are the result of consumer an d/or commercial dispos al,\u201d is irrelevant.89 EPA must \nassess all \u201ccircumstances . . . under which [TCEP]  is intended, known, or reasonably foreseen to \nbe . . . disposed of,\u201d90 and in prior risk evalua tions it has characterized disposal as a condition of \nuse, without attempting to allocate dispos al-related exposures between comme rcial and \nconsumer uses.91 Here, too, quantifying the proportion of landfill leaching attributable to \nconsumer versus commercial di sposal is not required.   \nMoreover, for the limited disposal -related releases that EPA did attempt to quantify, it \nutilized loading rates th at substantially understate the quantity of TCEP that is currently in, or \nwill foreseeably be entering, the waste phase. Specifically, EPA calcula ted disposal-related \nreleases based on estimated domestic produc tion volumes of 2,500 pounds  per year or 25,000 \npounds per year.92 Even assuming for the sake of argumen t that those estimates were accurate \nwith respect to current  TCEP production volume, EPA ac knowledges that U.S. production \nvolume for TCEP was nearly 100 per cent greater just ten years ago.93 That figure\u2014which does \n \ndetected V6\u2014a flame retardant that includes TC EP as an impurity\u2014in wa stewater from many of \nthose same source categories. \n86 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 149. \n87 Id. at 84\u201385. \n88 See, e.g. , Trine Eggen et al., Municipal Landfill Leachates: A Significant Source for New and \nEmerging Pollutants , 408 Sci.

Yet EPA\u2019s analysis fails to account for this reality.  \nIt is critical for EPA to char acterize these releases accurately  given, among other factors, \nthe \u201cpotential for TCEP to migrate to groundwater and dom estic wells from nearby non-\nhazardous waste landfills . . . or historic waste sites.\u201d97 Indeed, older landfills holding TCEP-\ncontaining articles are especially likely to leach  TCEP, as they \u201care more  likely to lack the \ninfrastructure of modern landfill s, such as liners, leachate co llection systems, and reactive \nbarriers, which would prevent leachate from entering the groundwater system.\u201d98 In revising the \ndraft risk evaluation, EPA must incorporate accu rate loading rates for TCEP-containing waste \ndisposed via landfilling, incine ration, and wastewater to a void substantially understating \ndisposal-related expos ures and risks. \nEPA also must correct additional flaws in its analysis of TCEP releases from waste \nincineration. First, EPA must eval uate exposure and risk associated with the toxic byproducts that \nresult from incineration of TCEP-c ontaining wastes. In the draft ri sk evaluation, EPA states that \n\u201cthermal treatment and open bur ning are not favorable options  for the disposal of TCEP\u201d \nbecause they generate significan t TCEP releases and also \u201cproduce numerous toxic byproducts, \n \n94 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 22 (\u201cIn the past, TCEP was processed in many products \nmade in the United States, includ ing fabrics and textiles, some types of foam, and construction \nmaterials\u2014some of which may still be in use today.\u201d); William A.

EPA must do so in the final \nrisk evaluation, utilizing waste-volume estimates th at reflect real world conditions. Second, in so \ndoing, EPA must consider the speci fic risks associated with treat ment of TCEP-containing wastes \nin nonhazardous solid waste incine rators versus open burning, as  these approaches will differ \nsubstantially in the extent of TCEP releases and releases of  toxic products of incomplete \ncombustion. As explained below, these differences must be accounted for in analyzing risks to \npotentially exposed or susceptible subpopul ations such as tribal populations.   \nC. EPA Fails to Evaluate Many of TCEP\u2019s Conditions of Use \nLike other OFRs, TCEP is used as a plasticizer  and a flame retardant in a range of plastic \nproducts. For instance, TCEP is \u201cused as an additi ve plasticiser . . . for polyurethane, polyesters, \npolyvinyl chloride and other polymers.\u201d100 TCEP has also been detected in high-density \npolyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d) water pipes,101 from which it can leach into water supplies and enter the \nenvironment.102 In some products, TCEP is also used \u201cas  a secondary plastici ser . . . to suppress \nthe flammability resulting from plasticisers such as phthalates.\u201d103 \u201cWhen used as an additive, \nTCEP is added to manufactured materials via ph ysical mixing rather th an chemical bonding and \nas a result, TCEP can easily leach or diffuse into its surrounding environment.\u201d104   \nThe foregoing plastic uses ar e all \u201ccircumstances . . . unde r which [TCEP] is intended, \nknown, or reasonably foreseen to be manufactured, processed, distributed in commerce, used, or \ndisposed of,\u201d and must th erefore be considered in the draft risk evaluation.105 But while EPA \nconsiders exposures to TCEP from plastics used  in certain aerospace equipment and children\u2019s \ntoys, it fails to evaluate the ma nufacturing, use, and disposal of  polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d) and \nHDPE pipes and other plastic material s that are known to contain TCEP.106 EPA also ignores the \n \n99 Id. at 437\u201338; see also id.  at 45 (\u201c[T]here is a robust conf idence that TCEP . . . produces \nhazardous byproducts when undergoing thermal degradation . . .\u201d). \n100 Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Biotechnology Info., Nat\u2019l Li br. of Med/, PubChem Annotation Record for \nTRIS(2-CHLOROETHYL) PHOSPHATE \u00a7 8.1, PubChem, https://pubchem.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/compound/8295  (last visited Feb. 6, 2024).  \n101 Tomas Diera et al., A Non-Target Screening Study of High-Density Polyethylene Pipes \nRevealed Rubber Compounds as Main Contaminant  in a Drinking Water Distribution System , \n229 Water Rsch.

It is irrelevant \nwhether TCEP is currently being used to ma ke those products, since TSCA requires EPA to \n \n17 \n presence of TCEP in microplastics that form from the breakdown of larg er plastics containing \nTCEP, or that adsorb and spr ead TCEP in the environment.107 This omission is particularly \nconcerning since studies have found that micr oplastic co-exposures can exacerbate TCEP\u2019s \nneurotoxicity.108 Microplastics containing TCEP can be ingested by fish, other wildlife, and \npeople, resulting in aggregate and cumulative risks that EPA unlawfully failed to address.109 To \nfully evaluate TCEP\u2019s risks \u201cunder the conditions of use,\u201d EPA must assess a broader range of \nplastic uses, as well as the presence of TCEP in microplastics, in its final risk evaluation.110 \nOther reported conditions of use, which are not mentioned in the draft risk evaluation, \ninclude the use of TCEP  in \u201clubricating oil,\u201d111 as \u201can extractant for rare metals,\u201d112 as a \u201cthermal \ncoolant\u201d for metals,113 and in \u201clithium batteries.\u201d114 EPA must look into those uses as well, and \neither include them in the TCEP risk evalua tion or justify its deci sion to exclude them.  \nIV. EPA Underestimates Exposures to TCEP \nA. The Draft Risk Evaluation Is Predicat ed on an Unsupported Assumption Concerning \nTCEP Manufacturing and Import V olumes \nEPA\u2019s calculations of TCEP\u2019s risks to workers, the genera l population, and the \nenvironment are based on an unsupported assump tion concerning the amount of TCEP that is \npresently manufactured or imported. Since EP A has no workplace monitoring or environmental \nrelease data for most of TCEP\u2019s conditions of us e, the Agency instead evaluates TCEP exposures \n \nconsider a chemical\u2019s legacy us es as well as its ongoing ones.

Indeed, a 2018 study estimated 1,110 \nkilograms (2,425 pounds) of annual TC EP air emissions in the City of Toronto alone, with a \nhigh-end estimate (95% confidence in terval) of 26,000 kilograms (57,320 pounds)125 With a \nsingle Canadian city estimate d to release nearly 2,500 pounds of  TCEP per year, EPA cannot \njustify calculating national TCEP releas es and exposures based on a 2,500-pound production \nestimate. EPA should instead evaluate risk based on a current production level that is equal to or \ngreater than the CDR repor ting threshold of 25,000 pounds, while also accounting for \nsubstantially higher domestic production and imp ort of TCEP in the recent past.     \n EPA\u2019s reliance on current production levels to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks understates the \nchronic risks to people who were exposed to far greater amounts of  TCEP in earlier life stages.126  \nBetween 1986 and 2002, the CDR-reported produc tion volume for TCEP was between 1,000,000 \nand 10,000,000 pounds, and in 2006 it was between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pounds\u2014several \norders of magnitude higher th an EPA\u2019s current 2,500-pound estimate.127 TCEP presents cancer \nand other chronic risks that accru e over a lifetime of exposures , and EPA calculates those risks \nusing a \u201clifetime averag e daily dose\u201d representing the averag e amount of TCEP that someone is \nexposed to each day over the course of their lifetime.128 For the purpose of determining a \nLifetime Average Daily Dose, past exposure levels within a person\u2019s lifespan are just as relevant \nas current ones. As the SACC advised EPA in  its report on the draft risk evaluation for \nperchloroethylene: \n[O]lder data should be used to estimate  prior exposure doses, which can then be \nadded to exposures going forw ard in time. It is unrealis tic to only address [those] \nwho start their exposures today (or within the last 10 years only). The [draft risk \n \n124 See, e.g., Qiao et al. 2022 at *2 (\u201cThe annual producti on and use of TCEP in China are tens of \nthousands of tons.\u201d). \n125 Timothy F. M.

Those older \nexposures are relevant to today\u2019s added risks.129   \nWhile EPA cannot turn back the clock and undo those prior exposures, it must regulate \ncurrent TCEP uses and exposure \u201cto the extent necessary\u201d so that the Lifetime Average Daily \nDose remains below the level a ssociated with unreasonable ris k. Moreover, as described above, \nEPA must consider prior production and import levels when evaluating the risks from TCEP \ndisposal, because much of the TC EP-containing waste that is curren tly being disposed of, or that \nis currently leaching out of landfills, comes from articles and products that  were manufactured or \nimported decades ago.130 By calculating risk using only an estimate of current production \nvolume\u2014which in itself is unjustifiably low\u2014EPA underestimates the chronic risks to workers, \nconsumers, and others who were exposed to much  higher levels of TCEP in earlier decades and \nviolates TSCA\u2019s mandate to appl y the \u201cbest available science.\u201d131  \nB. EPA Understates Infants\u2019 and Children\u2019s Exposures to TCEP \n The draft risk evaluation recognizes that \u201c[i]nfants are a pote ntially susceptible \npopulation because of their higher exposure per body weight, immature metabolic systems, and \nthe potential for chemical toxicants to disrupt sensitive developmental processes, among other \nreasons.\u201d132 Infants are exposed to TCEP from the milk they drink, the toys they play with, the \nmattresses they sleep on, and other sources. In multiple ways, however, EPA understates those \nexposures. \n First, EPA assumes that infants br eastfeed for a maximum of one year, 133 despite \nevidence and public health reco mmendations to the contrary . The American Academy of \nPediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend the contin uation of breastfeeding for at \nleast two years or longer,134 and CDC data show that more th an 17 percent of infants are still \nbreastfed at 18 months of age.135 EPA\u2019s assumption that breastfeeding will end after one year is \n \n129 TSCA Sci.

EPA concedes that \u201c[i]nformation on . . . \nmouthing durations\u201d was \u201climited,\u201d137 and the Exposure Factors Handbook recommends 95th \npercentile mouthing durations rangi ng from 11 minutes per hour (fo r children aged two to three \nyears) to 26 minutes per hour (for ch ildren aged three to six months.)138 EPA claims that its \nmouthing values were taken from EPA\u2019s Consumer  Exposure Model (\u201cCEM\u201d) but it does not say \nhow the model derived those estimates,  whereas the recommendations in the Exposure Factors \nHandbook  are backed by multiple studies of in fants\u2019 and children\u2019s mouthing behaviors.139 EPA \nshould use the 95th percentile mouthing durations from the Exposure Factors Handbook , or any \nhigher estimates in published literature, to calculate TCEP mouthing exposures. \n Third, while EPA separately calculated the risks from infants\u2019 breastfeeding and \nmouthing, it failed to consider  the risks to infants who ar e exposed to TCEP from both \nbreastmilk and the products they mouth, as  well as other exposure pathways.140 Breastfeeding \nand mouthing are both typical in fant behaviors, making it highly likely that a significant number \nof infants will be exposed from bo th pathways. Similarly, when calculating the concentrations of \nTCEP in breastmilk, EPA considered maternal TC EP exposures from individual conditions of use \nin insolation, but failed to cons ider aggregate exposures to la ctating people who are exposed \nfrom multiple conditions of use and thus have gr eater levels of TCEP in  their breastmilk. As \ndescribed in greater detail below,  EPA\u2019s failure to consider those aggregate exposures is contrary \nto TSCA and inconsistent with the best available science.141 \nC. EPA Also Understates Consumer, Worker , and General Population Exposures to \nTCEP \n EPA also understates consumer, worker, a nd general population exposures to TCEP.  \nFirst, EPA underestimates the c oncentrations of TCEP in polyu rethane foam products that are \nused by consumers and workers, including furn iture and automobile cushioning. While TCEP \nhas been detected at concentrations up to 19,800 mg/kg (1.98 percent)  in such foam, EPA \n \n136 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 195. \n137 Id. at 192. \n138 EPA, EPA/600/R-09/052F, Exposure Factors Handbook: 2011 Edition , at 4-3 (Sept. 2011) \n(\u201cExposure Factors Handbook\u201d), https://ordspub.epa.gov/ords/e ims/eimscomm.getfile?p_downl oad_id=522996 (recommending \n95\nth percentile mouthing duration values of 11-26 minutes per hour, depending on age). \n139 Compare Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 197, with Exposure Factors Handbook at 4-3, 4-12 \nto 4-14. \n140 See Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 245. \n141 See infra  Point VI.A. \n22 \n disregards that data and assumes TCEP c oncentrations of less than one percent.142 EPA asserts \nthat the lower values were \u201ct hought to be more current and representative of the U.S. \npopulation,\u201d presumably because the higher conc entrations were taken from a German study \npublished in 2001 (the \u201cIngerowski study\u201d).143 But TCEP and TCEP-containing products are \nimported into the United States , and many older vehicles and products containing TCEP foam \nare either still in use or are being disposed  of. Moreover, EPA relies on the Ingerowski study\u2014\nand other data that predates that study by more than a decade\u2014to calculate other TCEP \nexposures.144 EPA should similarly use that study when calculating TCEP exposures from \npolyurethane foam products. \n EPA also ignores workers\u2019 incidental inges tion of TCEP-containing dust that settles on \ntheir hands and clothing, despite pr eviously \u201cacknowledg[ing] that oral exposures are a potential \nroute for workers and agree[ing]  that hand-to-mouth and inges tion of dust particles can be \nsources of occupational oral exposure.\u201d145 TCEP has been detected in dust samples taken from \nresidential spaces, public spaces, vehicles, and recycling facilities.146 While EPA considered \nconsumers\u2019 ingestion of TCEP-containing dust,  it excludes that e xposure route from its \noccupational risk assessment and thus unde restimates workers\u2019 exposures and risks.147  \n Finally, EPA understates the duration and vol ume of general population exposures to \nTCEP. EPA  falsely assumes that no one will be e xposed to TCEP in the ambient air or surface \nwater for more than 33 years, based on a decades-o ld study of how long most people remained in \na single residence.148 But as the SACC advised EPA in its recent report on th e supplemental 1,4-\ndioxane risk evaluation, the \u201c homeowner mobility value (33 years) \u2026 is inadequate for \n[potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulat ion] communities,\u201d which TSCA expressly \nrequires EPA to consider, and is \u201carguably invalid for the general population as well.\u201d149 EPA\u2019s \nassumption understates the risks to people who rema in the in same reside nce for longer than 33 \nyears, as well as to people who move within a given community but remain exposed to the same \n \n142 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 175. \n143 Id. \n144 Id.

It is \u201cclearly not representative of tribes [or] diverse socioeconomic \ncommunities,\u201d who often have lo wer levels of geographic mobili ty and stronger connections to \nthe places where they live.150 The best available science requir es EPA to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks \nto impacted communities and th e general population ove r an entire lifetime, as opposed to \narbitrarily cutting off its expos ure calculations after 33 years.151  \nD. EPA Unlawfully Ignores Most Dietary Exposures to TCEP \nEPA further understates risks to exposed populations by ignoring dietary exposures \nbeyond contaminated fish. According to EPA, \u201c[a]n Australian study indicated that more than 75 \npercent of the estimated daily intake  of TCEP came from dietary ingestion.\u201d152   \nBut EPA excludes the vast majority of t hose dietary exposures from its draft risk \nevaluation, improperly attributi ng them to \u201cnon-TSCA\u201d uses.153 Contrary to EPA\u2019s claim, many \ndietary exposures are subject to  regulation under TSCA and must be evaluated and regulated by \nEPA. While TSCA excludes from the definition of chemical substance \u201cany food,\u201d as defined in \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201c FFDCA\u201d), \u201cwhen manufactured, processed, or \ndistributed in commerce for use as a food,\u201d not  all foods and methods of food production fall \nwithin the scope of that exclusion.154 For instance, just as subsistence fishing does not constitute \nthe \u201cmanufactur[ing], process[ing], or distribu t[ion] in commerce\u201d of an FFDCA-regulated food \nproduct, neither does the cu ltivation of crops, gathering of pl ants, or raising of livestock for \npersonal consumption. Yet the draft risk evaluati on does not evaluate whether TCEP\u2019s conditions \nof use may cause soil, water, or biosolids cont amination that result in  non-excluded dietary \nexposures ( e.g., from personal garden ing and farming.) \nMoreover, even uses that are not regulate d under TSCA still must be considered as \nbackground exposures when evaluating the risk s posed by TCEP. As EPA has previously \nacknowledged, \u201c[t]he potential ri sks of non-TSCA uses may help inform the Agency\u2019s risk \ndetermination for the exposures from uses that are covered under TSCA.\u201d155 Here, people with \ngreater dietary exposures will have higher levels of  TCEP in their bodies, and will thus be more \nsusceptible to harm from additional exposures .

For example, in its a ssessment and regulation of the \npesticide fumigant sulfuryl fluoride, EPA\u2019s Office  of Pesticide Programs (\u201cOPP\u201d) considered all \nsources of exposure to fluoride,  including ones EPA does not re gulate (such as toothpaste). \nConsidering these exposures was critical for accurate risk calcula tion and decision-making\u2014\nOPP proposed to terminate pesticid al uses of sulfuryl fluoride b ecause children\u2019s total exposure \nto fluoride (mainly from drinking water and toothpaste) exceeded acceptable exposure levels.158 \nEPA\u2019s Office of Water similarly routinely acc ounts for background exposures to contaminants \nwhen establishing drinking water standards by ap plying a default assumption that 80 percent of \ntotal contaminant exposures ar ise from non-water sources, desp ite those exposures falling \noutside of the regulatory purview of the Safe Drinking Water Act.159 Here, too, dietary exposures \ncontribute to TCEP\u2019s total risks and exacerbate  the risks that people experience from TSCA \nregulated uses. EPA must consider those exposures in the final risk evaluation.  \nE. EPA Understates Exposure Associated with  Recycling of TCEP-Containing Materials \nEPA has not fully or accurately characteri zed environmental releases, occupational \nexposures, or consumer exposures associated with the recycling of materials containing TCEP. \nEPA understates releases and exposures associated with e-waste recycling and fails to consider \nenvironmental, occupational, or consumer expos ures associated with the recycling of other \nTCEP-containing products, such as polyurethane foam. EPA must co rrect the flaws, and fill the \ngaps, in its analysis of recycling-relate d exposures in the final risk evaluation. \nIn the draft risk evaluation, EPA asserts that it  \u201cwas not able to quantify releases of TCEP \nthat could occur during the recycling of e-waste.\u201d160 Nonetheless, EPA asserts that \u201ctotal releases \nare expected to be low since TCEP is  not typically used in electronics\u201d161 and on that basis \nconcludes that the recycling condition of use does not contri bute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable \n \n156 See infra  Point VI. \n157 See Nat\u2019l Rsch.

Indeed, \nthe source EPA cites for the proposition that TCEP is not typically used in  electronics, Stapleton \net al. 2011, concerns detections of TCEP in fo am and does not discuss th e extent to which TCEP \nor any other flame retardan t is used in electronics.163 Contrary to EPA\u2019s characterization, peer-\nreviewed literature analyzing TCEP concentrations in e-waste recycling facilities indicates that \nTCEP releases are strongly associated with e- waste recycling. For exam ple, Gravel et al. 2019 \ndetected TCEP in 100 percent of air samples from Canadian e-waste recycling facilities, \ncompared to 67 percent of control group samples.164 Along with triphenyl phosphate (\u201cTPhP\u201d), \nTCEP was measured at the hi ghest concentrations among all organophosphate esters analyzed \nand was associated with the processing of both older [cathode ray tube] televisions and newer \ntelevisions.165 Nguyen et al. 2019 also detected TCEP a nd other flame retardants in dust and air \nsamples at Canadian e-waste processing f acilities, with TCEP \u201cthe most abundant \n[organophosphate ester flame retardan t] in workbench air samples.\u201d166 Further, Nguyen et al. \n2019 measured higher dust concentr ations at workbenches compared  to a central location within \nthe facility, \u201cconsistent with the release of  contaminated dust during dismantling\u201d of \nelectronics.167  \nMoreover, EPA makes no attempt to characteri ze releases and exposures associated with \nthe recycling of other TCEP-containing material s, including polyurethane  foam, in which EPA \nasserts TCEP \u201cis predominantly found.\u201d168 Polyurethane foam is r ecycled through a variety of \nprocesses,169 including mechanical processes that genera te substantial amounts of dust during the \nchopping or shredding of foam.170 Recycling of polyurethane foam  exposes recycling workers, \ncommunities, and the environment near recycling facilities; carpet installers; and consumers who \npurchase recycled-content products such as \u201crebo nd\u201d carpet padding or upholstered furniture that \ncontains recycled foam. \u201cPost-consumer foam (o ld carpet cushion) now returning for recycling \nmay contain up to 12 percent by weight\u201d of TCEP and other halogenated flame retardants, which \n \n162 Id. at 355, 364. \n163 Heather M.

EPA Underestimates TCEP\u2019s Hazards \nA. EPA Overlooks and Misapplies Ne cessary Uncertainty Factors \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s hazards and risks, EP A disregarded the best available science, \nas well as EPA\u2019s own risk assessment guidance,  concerning the use of uncertainty factors.  \nUncertainty factors are \u201cvery impor tant . . . to determining the sa fety of [chemicals] . . . to \nhumans,\u201d172 since they account for gaps and uncertainti es in the risk assessment process that \ncould otherwise \u201cresult [in] an incomplete char acterization of the chemical\u2019s toxicity\u201d and an \n\u201cunderprotective\u201d risk calculation.173  The use of appropriate uncerta inty factors is necessary to \nconduct risk evaluations \u201cin a manner consis tent with the best available science.\u201d174 In its draft \nrisk evaluation, however, EPA failed to apply tw o critical uncertainty factors and misapplied \nanother.  \nFirst, when calculating TCEP\u2019s chronic repr oductive toxicity, EPA relied on a subchronic \nduration study without applying the recommended \u201csubchronic-to- chronic-duration\u201d uncertainty \nfactor.175 In the draft risk evaluation, EPA explains that it chose \u201ca study with a shorter exposure \nduration\u201d to assess \u201cchronic exposure scenarios because it resulted in a[] [human equivalent \ndose] that is more sensitive . . . than most longer-term results.\u201d176 The problem is not that EPA \nselected the wrong study to calcu late reproductive risks, but ra ther that EPA misapplied the \nresults of that study.

As described above, EPA claims that it la cks sufficient data to evaluate several of \nTCEP\u2019s conditions of use.180 EPA also asserts that \u201cthe currentl y available evidence is inadequate \nto assess whether TCEP may cause endocrine ch anges,\u201d \u201cthyroid change s,\u201d \u201clung or respiratory \neffects in humans,\u201d or \u201cimmunological or hematological effects in humans.\u201d181 Those asserted \ngaps do not excuse EPA from evaluating all of TCEP \u2019s conditions of use and health effects, and \nEPA has an established approach for addressing precisely those so rts of database deficiencies. \n\u201c[T]o account for the potential fo r deriving an underpro tective [risk estimate] as a result of an \nincomplete characterization of th e chemical\u2019s toxicity,\u201d EPA gui dance recommends the use of an \nadditional \u201cdatabase deficiency\u201d uncertainty factor.182 In light of EPA\u2019s own claims of inadequate \ndata, EPA must apply that uncertainty factor here. \n Finally, EPA misapplies the \u201cintraspecies\u201d uncertainty factor, which is intended to \n\u201caccount for variations in susceptib ility\u201d within the general population.183 The intraspecies \nuncertainty factor is designed to  cover the myriad sources of variations within the general \npopulation, not the increased risks faced by disc rete potentially expos ed or susceptible \nsubpopulations. EPA has applied that ten-fold uncer tainty factor even in  circumstances where it \nfound \u201cno evidence of increased susceptibility fo r any single group relative to the general \npopulation,\u201d184 while acknowledging that \u201ca 10 -fold factor may . . . be too small\u201d to account for \n \n177 EPA Review of Ref.

Instead of calculating the risks to  those subpopulations\u2014s uch as people who are \nmore susceptible to TCEP\u2019s risks because of genetic conditions like Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletion, and myotonic dys trophy\u2014EPA asserts that their increased \nsusceptibility is \u201c[a]ddressed\u201d through the \u201c[u]se of [the] de fault [intraspecies uncertainty \nfactor].\u201d\n186  But that uncertainty factor is intend ed to address unspeci fied variations in \nsusceptibility across the general pop ulation, not the heighted risks f aced by identified potentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulations. Indeed, if a ten-fold intraspecies uncertainty factor is \nused to account for general popula tion variation even in the abse nce of a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation,187 the same adjustment plainly cannot account for those who are \nknown to experience increased susceptibility, and EPA offers no evidence that its default \nuncertainty factor would adequately capture the risks to all potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations. When EPA identifies potentiall y exposed or susceptible subpopulations, EPA \nmust calculate their risks separa tely from those of the genera l population, as opposed to relying \non a default uncertainty factor  that\u2014by EPA\u2019s own admission\u2014m ay not be up to the task.188 \nB. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Neurotoxicity Risks \nContrary to typical agency pr actice and the best available science, EPA failed to use the \nmost sensitive study when calculating TCEP\u2019s neurotoxic effects (the \u201cTilson study\u201d). EPA \nacknowledges that the Tilson study was the \u201cmos t sensitive\u201d neurotoxicity study after accounting \nfor uncertainty factors, resulting in risk esti mates that are far greater than those that EPA \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.189 But EPA did not use that study because \u201cthe authors \n \n185 EPA Review of Ref.

In partic ular, the ratio of the benchmark margin of \nexposure (expressed as \u201ctotal UF\u201d)  to the point of departure (expr essed as human equivalent dose \nor HED) is approximately 4.6 for the Tilson stud y and approximately 3.2 for the study selected \nby EPA, indicating that the Tilson study is mo re sensitive and would result in higher risk \ncalculations than those calculated  in the draft risk evaluation. Id. at 276\u201377. \n29 \n tested only a single dose level, which did not allow a full understanding of the dose-response for \nTCEP\u201d and \u201conly a [Lowest Observed Adverse Ef fect Level, or \u201cLOAEL\u201d] was identified,\u201d as \nopposed to a No Observed Adverse Effect Level (\u201cNOAEL\u201d).190   \nNone of those arguments justifies the decisi on to understate TCEP\u2019s neurotoxicity risks. \nWhile the Tilson study did involve only one dos e, nothing precludes EPA from relying on a \nsingle-dose study when it is the most sensitive, and EPA does not  need \u201ca full understanding of \nthe dose-response\u201d in order to establish a point  of departure and calc ulate risks from that \nstudy.191 Indeed, the Tilson study has been favorabl y cited in an analys is conducted for the \nCPSC,192 by Environment Canada and Health Canada,193 and, previously, by EPA itself.194 \nSimilarly, the fact that the Tilson study did not identify a NOA EL does not support disregarding \nthe study. EPA frequently calculate s risks based on LOAELs, using a ten-fold uncertainty factor \nto account for the absence of a NOAEL.195 To capture all of TCEP\u2019s potential risks, it is critical \nthat EPA use the most sensitive study for each endpoint, including the Tilson study for \nneurotoxicity.  \nC. EPA Understates TCEP\u2019s Cancer Risks \nWhen calculating TCEP\u2019s cancer risks, EPA re lied exclusively on kidney tumor data even \nthough TCEP exposures have been associat ed with other cancer sites as well.196 In addition to \nkidney cancer, studies have linked TC EP to leukemia and thyroid cancer.197 EPA admits that \n\u201c[u]se of tumor data for only one target organ ( i.e., not combining incidence with other target \norgan tumors) may result in so me underestimation of risk.\u201d198 But EPA made no effort to address \nthat concern by calculating total cancer risks. \nEPA must consider all know n cancer sites in its dose -response analysis and its \ndetermination of whether TCEP presents unrea sonable cancer risks.

EPA Violates TSCA\u2019s Mandate to Evaluate TCEP\u2019s Risks to Potentially Exposed or \nSusceptible Subpopulations  \n The draft risk evaluation also violates TSCA\u2019s  mandate to evaluate risks to \u201cpotentially \nexposed or susceptible subpopulation[s]\u201d who, \u201cdue to either greater susc eptibility or greater \nexposure, may be at greater risk than the ge neral population of advers e health effects from \nexposure\u201d to TCEP.201  As set forth below, EPA fails to consider several pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations\u2014including people w ho have \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP from \nmultiple conditions of use or exposure pathways or who have \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to harm \nbecause of their cumulative exposures to other flame retardants and toxi c chemicals in addition \nto TCEP. Additionally, EPA understates the risks to the potentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulations that it did identify.  \nA. EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Exposures and Risks to People Who Are \nExposed to TCEP From Multiple Conditions of Use and Exposure Pathways \n TSCA requires EPA to evaluate risks to those who are exposed to a chemical from \nmultiple conditions of use or from multiple exposure routes and pathways. First, such \npopulations experience \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater risk\u201d than  the general population because \nof those aggregate exposures, and thus consti tute a \u201cpotentially e xposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d that EPA must evaluate under TSCA section 6(b).202 In addition, TSCA section \n6(a) directs EPA to eliminate the unreasonable risks from \u201cany combination of\u201d a chemical\u2019s \nconditions of use, which is only possible if EPA fi rst evaluates the risks from such combinations \nof exposures and determines whether they are unreasonable.203 Finally, TSCA\u2019s \u201cbest available \nscience\u201d mandate compels the considerat ion of aggregate exposures and risks.204 The National \nAcademies have acknowledged the \u201cneed for\u201d risk assessment to  cover \u201caggregate exposure . . . \n \n199 Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment  at 1-12 to 1-13; see also EPA, EPA-740-R1-8012, \nRisk Evaluation for Asbestos  Part I: Chrysotile Asbestos  173\u2013175 (Dec. 2020),   \nhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-\n12/documents/1_risk_evaluation_for_asb estos_part_1_chrysotile_asbestos.pdf  (adding the risks \nassociated with multiple types of cancer associ ated with chrysotile asbestos to determine the \noverall cancer risk).   \n200 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 291. \n201 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n202 Id. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(12), 2605(b)(4)(A). \n203 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n204 Id. \u00a7 2625(h). \n31 \n [from] all routes, pathways, and sour ces of exposure to a given agent,\u201d205 and EPA\u2019s SACC has \nspecifically advised EPA to aggregate exposures  from multiple conditions of use under TSCA.206 \n EPA itself has recognized that \u201cin devel oping a comprehensive risk estimate for a \nchemical substance, it is  the Agency\u2019s responsibility to consid er the aggregation of what may be \nlower individual exposures from individual c onditions of use and routes of exposure.\u201d207 In its \nrecently proposed revisions to the TSCA risk ev aluation rule, EPA states that it \u201cwill consider \naggregate exposures to the chemical substance.\u201d208   \n In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA ignores all aggr egate exposures from \ncombinations of conditions of use and most aggr egate exposures from combinations of exposure \npathways and routes.209 While EPA claims to \u201clack . . . r easonably available data indicating co-\nexposures of multiple TCEP containing activit ies or products in the occupational and indoor \nenvironment,\u201d EPA cannot disregard aggregate ex posures merely because it failed to gather \ninformation on them.210 TSCA requires EPA to evaluate the risks posed by TCEP through the \n\u201ccircumstances . . . under which [the] chemical  substance is intende d, known, or reasonably \nforeseen to be manufactured, processed, distribute d in commerce, used, or disposed of.\u201d211  \nTCEP\u2019s uses are neither rare nor  unforeseen; the chemical has been widely used as a flame \nretardant and plasticizer in hom e insulation, furniture, rugs, and other common products. It is \nthus virtually inevitable, and certainly \u201creasonably  foreseen,\u201d that some of the people whose roof \ncontains TCEP insulation also own a rug or a vehi cle with TCEP as well, and that some of the \npeople who are exposed to TCEP on the job also  have TCEP-containing products and materials \nin their homes.212 EPA must evaluate those reasonably fo reseen combinations of exposures, and \nthe risk evaluation contains all of the inform ation that EPA needs to do so. Since EPA has \ncalculated the exposures from those conditions of use individually, it can add them to calculate \nrisks to the people who are exposed  from reasonably foreseen combin ations of conditions of use. \nAs further support for those aggr egate exposure calculations, EP A should consider studies of \n \n205 Science and Decisions at 266. \n206 TSCA Sci.

First, as described above, EPA has not \nsupported its total produ ction volume estimate of 2,500 pounds per year.214 Second, even if that \nestimate were supported and all pr oduction-related re leases were attributed to a single pathway, \nthe public would still expe rience aggregate exposures that EPA has not accounted for. In addition \nto production-related releases of TCEP, people ar e also exposed to TCEP  from landfill leachate \n(which is the result of historic  as well as ongoing TCEP use), the consumption of contaminated \nfish and wildlife (which does not depend on cu rrent production volumes alone), and from other \nexposure routes and pathways. Rather than \u201cdou ble count[ing]\u201d exposures, the consideration of \nrisks across exposure routes and pathways\u2014ma ny of which are not tied to TCEP\u2019s current \nproduction volume\u2014would more accurately re flect real-world exposures and risks.  \n EPA also claims that when a single exposure pathway or condition of use is sufficient to \nestablish unreasonable risk, the consideration of additional, aggregate exposures is unnecessary.\n215 This argument misunderstands the central purpose of a risk evaluation, which is \nnot only to determine the n eed for risk management ( i.e., whether an unreasonable risk exists) \nbut also to determine the extent of the risk management needed. TSCA requires EPA to regulate \nchemicals \u201cto the extent necessa ry so that [they] no longer pr esent[] [unreasonable] risk.\u201d216 If \nEPA has not considered aggregate exposures to  determine the full extent of a chemical\u2019s \nunreasonable risks, then it will not have the in formation it needs during risk management to \nensure that such risks are eliminated. For in stance, someone may be exposed to unreasonable \ncancer risk from both the ingest ion of TCEP-contaminated fish and the inhalation of TCEP from \ntheir home insulation. According to EPA, there is no need to consider their aggregate exposures \nand risks because either condition of use and exposure pathway alone  is sufficient to support an \n \n213 Id. \n214 See supra  Point IV .A. \n215 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 340 (\u201cThere were  no instances of aggreg ate lifetime risk for \nany [condition of use] where there was not alr eady risk to the [condition of use] from an \nindividual route . . . .

To \nfully address their risks, and to comply with it s TSCA obligations, EPA must evaluate the risks \nfrom known, intended, and reasonably foreseen comb inations of conditions of use, exposure \nroutes, and exposure pathways. \nB. EPA Fails to Consider the Increased Sus ceptibility of People Who Are Exposed to \nTCEP and Other Toxic Chemicals That Contribute to Cumulative Health Risks \n EPA also fails to evaluate as potentially  exposed or susceptib le subpopulations people \nwho experience \u201cgreater susceptibility\u201d to ha rm from TCEP exposures because of their \ncumulative exposures to multiple ch emicals and non-chem ical stressors.218 Like the failure to \nconsider aggregate exposures, this  omission violates not only TSCA \u2019s mandate to evaluate risks \nto potentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulations but also the requirement to conduct risk \nevaluations using the \u201cb est available science.\u201d219 The National Academies ha ve repeatedly called \nfor the consideration of cumulative exposures in chemical risk eval uations, explaining that \u201cit is \ndifficult to imagine any risk assessment in which it would not be important to understand the \neffects of coexposures to agents or  stressors that have similar [mode s of action] . . . or to identify \ncharacteristics of the affected populations that could contribute to vulnerability to a given \nexposure.\u201d220 More recently, the National Acade mies called on agencies to \u201cmove beyond \nsource-by-source and pollutant-by-pollutant . . . risk assessment a nd toward a fuller \ncharacterization of the cumulative and potential ly synergistic health risks from multiple \nenvironmental and social stress ors that disproportionately imp act communities of color\u201d and \neconomically insecure communities.221 Similarly, the SACC has characterized cumulative \nexposure assessment as \u201ca necessary step \u201d in the TSCA risk evaluation process.222 EPA itself \nadmits that \u201cwithout considering the cumulative risk of chemicals,  the Agency\u2019s risk mitigation \nmay not fully be able to consider the public-h ealth implications of va rious risk management \noptions for reducing exposure.\u201d223 \nYet EPA makes no effort to address cumulative exposures and risks in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, despite available evidence of such risks.

Similarly, studi es have shown cumulative risks \nfrom co-exposures to TCEP and microplastics, which exceed the risks associated with TCEP \nalone.226 EPA did not consider those cumulative ex posures and the resulting increase in \nsusceptibility and risk.   \nNor did EPA evaluate cumulative risks fro m exposures to TCEP and other flame \nretardants. For instance, TCEP is an impurity in the flame-retardant mixture V6, and the two \nflame retardants are frequen tly detected in the same pr oducts and environmental media.227 While \nEPA considered exposures to TCEP from the use of products containing V 6, it never assessed the \ncumulative effects of those flame retardants together. TCEP also  is found alongs ide other flame \nretardants\u2014including PBDEs and other organophos phate ester flame retardants like TCPP and \nTDCPP\u2014in household dust, water, and other environmental media.228 Many of those flame \nretardants are associat ed with the same types of harm as TCEP,229 meaning people who are \nexposed to other flame retardants will be more su sceptible to harm from their TCEP exposures.  \nEPA has acknowledged the cumulative effects fro m other organophosphate chemicals, such as \norganophosphate pesticides.230 Organophosphate ester flame retardan ts are \u201cstructu rally similar\u201d \n \n224 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 333 (\u201c In vitro  data on co-exposure with benzo-a-pyrene \nshowed increased impacts on inflamma tion and proliferation pathways.\u201d). \n225 Youjian Zhang et al., Combined Effect of Tris(2-chlor oethyl)phosphate and Benzo (a) pyrene \non the Release of IL-6 and IL-8 from HepG2 Cells Via the EGFR-ERK1/2 Signaling Pathway , 7 \nRoyal Soc\u2019y Chem.

EPA Understates TCEP Exposures a nd Risks to Tribal Populations \nWe strongly support EPA\u2019s identifi cation of tribal popul ations as a \u201cpotentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u201d  for purposes of the TCEP risk evaluation.232 As reflected in the draft \nrisk evaluation and elaborated below, TSCA\u2019s de finition of \u201cpotentially exposed or susceptible \nsubpopulation\u201d indisputably includes tribal populations , who consistently face \u201cgreater risk than \nthe general population of adverse health effects from exposure to a chemical substance or \nmixture\u201d because of both \u201cgreater e xposure\u201d and \u201cgreater susceptibility.\u201d233 Yet, until now, EPA \nfailed to identify tribal populations as a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation \nrequiring particularized consider ation in risk evaluation and ri sk management. In taking the \ncritical step of identifying tribal populations as a higher- risk subpopulation, EPA correctly \nrecognizes that tribal populations \u2019 \u201cintricate connection to the la nd and . . . distinctive lifeways \nand cultures . . . create many unique exposure scen arios that can expose tr ibal members to higher \ndoses of contaminants in the environment.\u201d234  \nHowever, in the draft risk evaluation for TCEP, EPA failed to follow through on this \ninsight by comprehensively asse ssing the factors that increase tribal popul ations\u2019 exposure to\u2014\nand susceptibility to harm from\u2014TCEP. Indee d, \u201cEPA did not evaluate\u201d the heightened \nexposures associated with \u201cactivities that are uni que to tribal populations\u201d and \u201cquantitatively \nevaluated only the tribal fish ingestion pa thway for TCEP because of data limitations.\u201d235 As EPA \nacknowledges, this approach \u201coverlooks many other unique exposure scenarios\u201d236 and \nultimately understates th e risks TCEP presents to  tribal populations. To sa tisfy TSCA, in the final \nTCEP risk evaluation EPA must utilize all readil y available information to characterize tribal \npopulations\u2019 exposures and susceptibilities, as well as appropriately c onservative assumptions \nand uncertainty factors wh ere data are limited.  \nAmong other factors that increase TCEP e xposures in tribal populations, EPA must \naccount for the impact of solid waste disposal pr actices in tribal comm unities.

EPA\u2019s Exposure Factors Handbook  provides a mean fish ingestion rate \nfor an Alaska Native Nation of 770 g/day.248 A 1999 study by Walker a nd Pritchard reports an \ningestion rate of 650 g/day for subsistence fishers in the Yaka ma Tribe, based on actual use \nbetween 1950 to 1971.249 EPA provides no basis for disregar ding these substa ntially higher \nreported rates. Third, as discussed above, EPA unde restimates environmenta l releases of TCEP \nand resulting concentrations of TCEP in fis h, which leads EPA to further understate TCEP \nexposures from fish consump tion in tribal communities.250 Fourth, although EPA calculated \nTCEP exposures from fish consumption using a high and low bioaccumulation factor (\u201cBAF\u201d) of \n2,198 L/kg and 109 L/kg, respectively,251 EPA only utilized the low BAF \u201cto determine \nunreasonable risk.\u201d252 EPA offers no explanation for disc arding the higher BAF at the risk \ncharacterization stage, which generated si gnificantly less severe risk calculations.253  \nFinally, EPA did not consider aggregate or cu mulative chemical exposur es affecting tribal \npopulations nor account for increase d susceptibility to harm from TCEP exposures among tribal \npopulations due to psychosocial stressors such as poverty, crowded and/ or substandard housing \nconditions, health care ine quity, and discrimination.254 Further, while EPA acknowledged that \ntribal populations\u2019 access to subsistence fish sp ecies is severely constrained, EPA did not \nconsider the effect that reduced  access to fish and other traditi onal foods has on nutrition, health, \n \n246 See, e.g. , Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 170, 221, 232. \n247 Harper et al.

EP A must correct these \ndeficiencies in the final risk ev aluation to accurately characterize exposures and risks in tribal \npopulations and ensure that EPA\u2019s forthcoming ri sk management rule for TCEP will include all \nmeasures that are necessary to  eliminate the unreasonable risk s tribal populations face.   \nD. EPA Fails to Calculate TCEP\u2019s Increased Ri sks to Truck Drivers, Students Residing \nin Dormitories, and Firefighters. \nEPA also overlooks increased TCEP exposures  of several other pot entially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulations. \nFirst, TCEP is used in automotive foam, 255 posing increased risks to long-haul truck \ndrivers and others who spend more time in vehi cles than the general population. TCEP is also \nused in mattresses and carpets, with greater  exposures from \u201cextremely worn carpets.\u201d256 Long-\nhaul truck drivers spend far more time inside ve hicles than the general population, and they are \nmore likely to sleep in their vehicle cabs.257   \nBut EPA never considered the in creased risks that truck driv ers\u2014a potentially exposed or \nsusceptible subpopulation\u2014expe rience from their \u201cgreater exposure\u201d to TCEP.258 Instead, EPA \nsolely evaluates the risks that TCEP in automo tive and furniture foam presents to the general \npublic, who EPA assumes will be exposed for no more than one hour per day and no more than \n73 days per year.259 Those assumptions underestimate risks to the general population (including \npeople who have long, daily commute s in their cars), and are plai nly inapplicable to truckers \nwho can exceed EPA\u2019s annual exposure estimate  in a span of one to two weeks.   \n EPA also fails to calculate TCEP\u2019s risks to firefighters, despite identifying them as a \npotentially exposed or suscep tible subpopulation. EPA acknowledge s that \u201cfirefighters have \nelevated TCEP exposures as a re sult of firefigh ting activities,\u201d 260 including the inhalation of \nTCEP that is aerosolized from products and building materials when they burn.

Using that info rmation, EPA should calculate TCEP \u2019s risks to firefighters.   \nFinally, EPA must consider TCEP\u2019s risks to students in dormitories and other student \nhousing, which are more likely to contain older or  second-hand furniture and less likely to have \nvacuum cleaners that limit the accumulation of dust . High levels of TCEP have been detected in \ndust in student dorms and common areas , with measurements up to 32,000 ng/g.265 TCEP levels \nin one dorm room exceeded Califor nia\u2019s risk-based soil screening standards, indicating potential \nrisk.266 Yet EPA fails to consider that data in the draft risk evaluation, a nd it does not evaluate \nstudents\u2019 increased exposures to and risks from TCEP. \nVII. EPA Has Not Adequately Assessed th e Risks TCEP Poses to Wildlife \nAs EPA acknowledges, it has coequal oblig ations under TSCA to determine whether \nTCEP \u201cpresents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. \u201d267 Yet in multiple \nrespects, EPA\u2019s assessment of the risks TCEP poses to wildlife is incomplete, does not \nconsistently incorporate and reflect the best avai lable science, and violates TSCA. We urge EPA \nto correct the deficiencies outlined below in the final risk evaluation. \nA. EPA Unlawfully Omitted Conditions of Use, Exposure Pathways, and Exposure \nSources from Its Assessment of  Wildlife Exposures to TCEP \nAt the outset, EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s environmental risks does not satisfy TSCA \nbecause EPA failed to determine the environmental risks associated with multiple conditions of \nuse268 and, for many others, provided only a cursor y discussion that dismissed environmental \n \n261 Id. \n262 Id.  \n263 Id. \n264 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a). \n265 Dodson et al.

For exam ple, to justify its failure to determine the \nenvironmental risks associated with TCEP releases from consumer products, EPA asserts that \n\u201c[c]onsumer releases to the environment are antici pated to be less than oc cupational releases, and \nwastewater concentrations from manufacturing, commercial and pr ocessing [conditions of use] \nwere shown to be significantly lower than acu te and chronic [concentrations of concern]\u201d \ncalculated in the draft risk evaluation.270 It is difficult to underst and how EPA can make this \nclaim about the magnitude of TCEP  releases from consumer products  since it failed to estimate \nthose releases. Indeed, EPA\u2019s observation elsewhere in the draft risk evaluation that \u201c[l]aundry \nwastewater may be the primary source of TCEP to wastewater treatment plant influent and \nsubsequently to the aquatic envi ronment\u201d appears to contradict the Agency\u2019s justification for \nwriting off consumer product releases.271 Further, even if EPA were  correct that environmental \nreleases from consumer products ar e less than releases from other conditions of use, that would \nnot excuse EPA from fully characterizing and acc ounting for those releases. As discussed above,  \nin the context of assessing human health risk s EPA has recognized that \u201cin developing a \ncomprehensive risk estimate for a chemical s ubstance, it is the Agen cy\u2019s responsibility to \nconsider the aggregation of what  may be lower individual exposu res from individual conditions \nof use and routes of exposure.\u201d272 This conclusion applies equa lly to EPA\u2019s assessments of \nenvironmental risk and underscores that EPA ma y not write off exposures associated with a \nspecific condition of use on the basis that they ma y be less than those asso ciated with another. \nAs EPA recently acknowledged in its proposed amendments to the regulations governing \nTSCA risk evaluations, it also lacks discretion to disregard k nown pathways of TCEP exposure \n \ncondition of use \u201cseparately from the risks already estimated for other relevant [conditions of \nuse]\u201d); id. at 364 (\u201cEPA is unable to determine if dis posal contributes to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable \nrisk.\u201d). \n269 See, e.g., id.  at 147 (explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures to TCEP \nassociated with industrial and commercial use of aerospace equipm ent and products but \n\u201cexpect[s]\u201d these conditions of use \u201cto have lower risk than the qua ntified scenarios\u201d); id. at 148 \n(explaining that EPA failed to qua ntify environmental exposures associated with consumer use \nand disposal of articles cont aining TCEP but stating without support that these releases are \n\u201canticipated to be less than  occupational releases\u201d); id. at 363 (asserting that , for most conditions \nof use, \u201cthe Agency had limited data available an d was not able to fully quantify risks to the \nenvironment\u201d). \n270 Id. at 148. \n271 Id. at 75. \n272 88 Fed.

Similarly, \u201c[d]irect exposure of TCEP to aquatic receptors via \nbiosolids was not asse ssed quantitatively.\u201d275 These omissions violate TSCA, which does not \ngive EPA discretion to write off exposure pa thways that it judges\u2014here, without even \nconducting a complete analysis\u2014contribute relativel y less to overall risk. Further, EPA will not \nbe able to determine what measures are needed  at the risk management stage to eliminate \nTCEP\u2019s environmental risks if it has ignored importan t segments of exposure and risk at the \nevaluation stage. Wildlife exposur e to TCEP via biosolids app lication is undoubtedly important; \nas EPA found, \u201c[d]ue to its persistence, it is li kely that dissolved TCEP will eventually reach \nsurface water via runoff after the land application of biosolids.\u201d276 \nIt also appears that EPA\u2019s an alysis of wildlife ingestion exposure did not consider the \ncontribution of ingested  plastic debris and microplastics.  Many wildlife species, including \nloggerhead sea turtles protected by the ESA,277 are chronically exposed to organophosphate \nflame retardants such as TCEP and other toxic chemicals through ingestion of plastic.278 \u201cSea \nbirds also ingest microplastics voluntarily,\u201d and peer-reviewed re search indicates that \u201cingested \nplastic debris [i]s a major source of plastic additives for sea birds.\u201d279 Further, in recent studies \n\u201c[t]he concentration of plastic additives in su rface waters and the a bundance of microplastic \nparticles were not correlated, implying that th ey are not necessarily good indicators for each \nother in this compartment.\u201d280 Accordingly, EPA\u2019s consideration of TCEP concentrations in \nsurface water and prey species do es not substitute for analyzing wildlife e xposures to TCEP from \ningested plastic. EPA must address this source of ingestion exposure in the final risk evaluation.   \n \n273 See id.  at 74,294 (stating that \u201cexclud[ing] certai n exposure pathways\u201d from a risk evaluation \n\u201cconflict[s] with the plain language of the law to evaluate chemical substances under the known, \nintended or reasonably foreseen circumstances asso ciated with the full lifecycle of the chemical \nsubstance\u201d and \u201cprevent[s] consideration of re levant exposure informat ion . . . in spite of \nstatutory requirements that the Agency base its decisions on the best  available science\u201d). \n274 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 94; see also id.  at 119, 138. \n275 Id. at 138. \n276 Id.  \n277 See NOAA Fisheries, Loggerhead Turtle , https://www.fisheries.noaa .gov/species/loggerhead-\nturtle  (last visited Jan. 25, 2024) (identifying distinct  population segments liste d as threatened or \nendangered under the Endangered Species Act). \n278 Berta Sala et al., First Study on the Presence of Plastic Additives in Loggerhead Sea Turtles \n(Caretta caretta ) from the Mediterranean Sea , 283 Env\u2019t Pollution Art No. 117108, at 1\u20132, 4\u20136 \n(2021); see also  Fauser et al.

EPA\u2019s Environmental Hazard Thresholds Are Not Sufficiently Protective of Aquatic \nSpecies  \nEPA\u2019s environmental hazard thre sholds are insufficiently pr otective of aquatic life. EPA \ncalculated a concentration of concern of 55.9 parts-per-bil lion (\u201cppb\u201d) for chronic TCEP \nexposure among aquatic species, based on a 14-day study of growth and de velopment effects in \nJapanese medaka, a fish species.281 However, a 2021 peer reviewed study (Zhao et al. 2021) \ndocumented adverse effects on juvenile yellow  catfish exposed to substantially lower \nconcentrations of TCEP over 30 days, incl uding significant adverse effects on growth, \nhistological changes to gills, and altered gene expression.282 Histological changes to gill cells \noccurred at doses as low as 1 \u03bcg/L, equivalent to 1 ppb, while adverse effects on growth and \nbody weight occurred at doses as low as 10 ppb.283 And at 100 ppb TCEP exposure, \u201cthe survival \nrate of juvenile yellow catfish . . . was signifi cantly decreased compared with the control after \n30-day exposure, which implied th at high environmental concentra tions of TCEP could threaten \nthe survival of juvenile yellow catfish.\u201d284 Based on this study and uti lizing the assessment factor \nof ten that EPA applied to calcu late its concentration of conc ern, Zhao et al. would support a \nconcentration of concern as low as 0.1 ppb (based  on histological changes to gill cells) or 1 ppb \n(based on growth effects). It does not appear th at EPA considered this study in developing the \ndraft risk evaluation, and it must do so in revising the draft a nd appropriately strengthen its \nhazard thresholds to protect aquatic life\u2014i ncluding the most sensitive species.  \nC. EPA Has Not Adequately Evaluated the Ri sks TCEP Presents to Birds, Marine \nMammals, Threatened and Endangered Sp ecies, and Other Species of Special \nConcern \nThe draft risk evaluation indi cates that EPA\u2019s assessment of TCEP\u2019s hazards to aquatic \norganisms and mammals rests on st udies in fish (for aquatic orga nisms) and mice and rats (for \nmammals),285 and that its risk characteri zation for terrestrial vertebra tes is based on an analysis \nof trophic transfer expos ures to American mink.286 EPA has not justified its failure to assess \nhazards and risks to other species in characterizing TCEP\u2019s risks to wildlife. EPA also failed to \nincorporate available literature and data in the dr aft risk evaluation that ar e relevant to assessing \nrisks to birds, marine mammals, and threatened  and endangered species. EPA must correct these \nomissions in the final risk evaluation to satisfy TS CA and ensure that its risk determinations and \n \n281 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104, 107. \n282 Yixin Zhao et al., Effects of Tris (2-chl oroethyl) Phosphate (TCEP) on Survival, Growth, \nHistological Changes and Gene Expressions in Juvenile Yellow Catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco , \n87 Env\u2019t Toxicology & Phar macology Art No. 103699 (2021). \n283 Id. 7; see also id.  at 1, 3\u20134 (describing adverse effects on growth at 10 ppb TCEP exposure). \n284 Id. at 5. \n285 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 104\u201306. \n286 Id. at 144. \n44 \n subsequent risk management ru le will protect wildlife species whose life histories and/or \nvulnerable conservation status  place them at greater ri sk from exposure to TCEP.287 \nAt the outset, EPA has not justified its relian ce on such a narrow set of wildlife species to \ncharacterize TCEP\u2019s environmental hazards. EPA\u2019 s ecological risk assessment guidance directs \nthe Agency to consider multiple criteria in se lecting \u201cassessment endpoin ts\u201d for ecological risk \nassessment, including a species \u2019 \u201c(1) ecological relevance, (2) susceptibility to known or \npotential stressors, and (3) re levance to management goals.\u201d288 \u201cOf these, ecological relevance \nand susceptibility are essential for selecting assessment endpoin ts that are scientifically \ndefensible.\u201d289 EPA has not justified its exclusive reli ance on fish and mouse/rat studies under \nthese criteria. \nFurther, EPA has not considered all reasonably available information that is relevant to \nevaluating TCEP\u2019s risks to species of special  ecological and conser vation concern\u2014including \nbut not limited to marine mammals. Aside from ci ting three studies reporti ng lipid concentrations \nof TCEP in aquatic mammals,290 the draft risk evaluation does not  discuss exposure or risks to \nthese species. This omission must be addresse d in the final risk ev aluation. TCEP and other \norganophosphates are widely dete cted in marine mammals,291 and a recent study documented \nsignificant biomagnification of the TCEP metabo lite bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (\u201cBCEP\u201d) in \nmarine mammals.292 Further, \u201c[m]arine mammals, such as  cetaceans and pinnipeds, are widely \nacknowledged as sentinel species to assess marine contamination status and health of marine \necosystem[s] due to being long-te rm inhabitants and long-lived apex predators at high trophic \nlevels in the marine ecosystem.\u201d293 As a result of their long life  spans, high trophic position in \naquatic food webs; and \u201cthick subcutaneous li pid layer (i.e. blubber),\u201d in which persistent \npollutants can accumulate, their exposure to and ri sks from persistent pollutants such as TCEP \n \n287 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(F)(i) (requ iring EPA to \u201cintegrate and assess available information on \nhazards and exposures . . . that is  relevant to specific risks of in jury to . . . the environment\u201d). \n288 EPA, EPA/630/R-95/002F, Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment  30 (Apr. 1998) \n(\u201cGuidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment\u201d), https://www.epa.gov/site s/default/files/2014-\n11/documents/eco_r isk_assessment1998.pdf .  \n289 Id. \n290 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 96. \n291 See, e.g., Mengqin Chen et al., Tissue Distribution and Trophi c Transfer of Organophosphate \nTriesters and Diesters in Thr ee Marine Mammals of the Liaodong Bay and the Northern Yellow \nSea, 461 J.

In its avian exposure assessme nt,  EPA discusses only two studies \nmeasuring TCEP concentrations in bird eggs,296 disregarding a recent study, Choo et al. 2022, \nthat reported high concentrations  of TCEP in black gull eggs and a 377 percent increase in \nmeasured TCEP concentrations between 2012 to 2018.297 Further, it does not appear that EPA \nintegrated the available data on TCEP concentrati ons in bird eggs into its risk characterization.298 \nThis is problematic because the sensitivity of wildlife to chemical stressors \u201ccan be related to the \nlife stage of an organism when exposed to a st ressor,\u201d and \u201c[f]requently , young animals are more \nsensitive to stressors than adults.\u201d299  \nRegarding hazards to avian species, EPA asse rts that \u201conly a single high-quality study \nwas available for the American ke strel with no hazard value for the avian insectivore within [the] \nanalysis.\u201d300 This approach is not adequate to accura tely characterize TCEP exposures and risks \nto birds. The high TCEP concentrations in bl ack gull eggs reported in Choo et al. 2022 may \nreflect the study\u2019s assessment of birds that feed primarily on fi sh since, as EPA acknowledges, \n\u201cTCEP has the ability to quickly bioaccumulate in  fish tissue if it is exposed to high TCEP \nconcentration[s] in the surroundi ng water for a period of time.\u201d301 In the final risk evaluation, \nEPA should consider exposure and risk to fish-e ating birds.

EPA Must Assess Aggregate and Cumulative Risks to Wildlife  \nFinally, to satisfy its statutory mandate to u tilize the best available science, EPA\u2019s final \nrisk evaluation for TCEP must consider aggr egate and cumulative exposures and risks to \nwildlife.311 It is axiomatic that \u201corganisms do not live in single-stress situations. Rather they are \nconstantly exposed to a series of differen t stressors, both chemical and non-chemical.\u201d312 EPA\u2019s \nrisk evaluation cannot ignore this reality. \nRegarding aggregate exposures to TCEP among wildlife, EPA acknowledged but refused \nto consider them.313 This leads EPA to underestimate wildli fe exposures and risks and must be \ncorrected in the final risk evaluation. \nEPA likewise must correct its failure to consider  cumulative exposures and risks among \nwildlife. As NMFS has observed, \u201c[m] ixture effects case studies that have examined effects from \nthe interaction of [persistent orga nic pollutants] . . . demonstrate th at the interaction of pollutants \nis primarily synergistic and toxicity is enhance d, especially when the exposure to the chemical \nmixture is at a critical developmental growth period.\u201d314 Accordingly, NMFS has criticized \necological risk assessments that  focus on \u201chigh doses of [single] contaminants,\u201d which \u201cmay \nunderestimate risk . . . because some contaminan ts can interact at doses below the no observed \neffect concentrations (NOECs) and produce significant effects.\u201d315 Consideration of additive and \nsynergistic effects is particularly important in  the risk evaluation at hand given the extensive \nliterature documenting wildli fe species\u2019 co-exposures to TCEP along with other \norganophosphates, PBDEs, PCBs, phthalates, and additional contaminants that are known to \nexert common adverse health effects on animals.316 Further, there are established methods and \n \n310 See Sala et al.

EPA\u2019s Unreasonable Risk Thresholds Are Unsupported and Underprotective \n EPA\u2019s thresholds for determining whether TC EP presents unreasona ble cancer risk are \nunsupported, vague, and inconsistently applied. EPA has historically supported the use of a 1-in-\n1,000,000 cancer risk threshold under  TSCA, consistent with th e level used in other EPA \nprograms.319 In the draft TCEP risk evaluation, however,  EPA replaces that clear benchmark with \n\u201ca range of extra cancer risk from 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] to 1\u00d710\u22126 [1-in-1,000,000].\u201d320 There is \nno legal or scientific justification for that change. \n EPA sets the threshold for unreasonable o ccupational cancer risks at the less protective \nend of that range, claiming that, \u201c[c]onsistent wi th [National Institute for Occupational Safety \nand Health  (\u201cNIOSH\u201d)] guidance, u nder TSCA EPA typically applies a 1\u00d710\u22124 [1-in-10,000] \nbenchmark for occupational scenar ios in industrial and commercial  work environments subject \nto [Occupational Safety and Health  Administration]  requirements.\u201d321 This justification \nmisinterprets NIOSH guidelines, which describe 1-in-10,000 not as a target cancer risk level but \nrather \u201ca starting point for continually reduci ng exposures in order to reduce the remaining \nrisk.\u201d322 NIOSH goes on to say that \u201cfor most car cinogens, there is no known safe level of \nexposure\u201d and NIOSH will continue  to recommend that employers  reduce worker exposure to \noccupational carcinogens as much as possibl e through the hierarchy of controls, most \n \n317 See Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, Inc. et al., Comments on Draft Proposed Principles of \nCumulative Risk Assessment Under the Toxic Substances Control Ac t, at 29\u201330 (Apr. 28, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/co mment/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2022-0918-0035  (collecting examples). \n318 Gina Solomon et al., Integrating Environmenta l Justice into Public Health: Approaches for \nUnderstanding Cumulative Impacts , 5 Frontiers Pub.

EPA vaguely states that \u201c[e]xposure-related \nconsiderations ( e.g., duration, magnitude, popula tion exposed) can affect\u201d the reasonableness of \ncancer risk, but it does not explain how it will ap ply and weigh those considerations, opening the \ndoor to arbitrary and unprinc ipled risk determinations.328  \n Finally, the draft risk evaluation does not even adhere to EPA\u2019s own, weakened cancer \nrisk thresholds. EPA states that five conditions of use \u201cwere preliminary [sic] determined not to \ncontribute to the unreasonable ris k,\u201d including consumer uses of \u201cbuilding/construction materials \n\u2013 insulation.\u201d329 But according to EPA\u2019s risk calculati ons, \u201c[i]nhalation from insulation presents \nthe highest lifetime cancer risk (4.50\u00d710\u22122)\u201d to consumers.330 This calculated cancer risk of 4.5-\nin-100 is more than 450 times gr eater than the EPA\u2019s least protective, 1-in-10,000 unreasonable \n \n323 Id. \n324 Id.; see also  TSCA Sci.

EPA Should Not Calculate Existing Chemic al Exposure Limits During the Risk \nEvaluation   \n The purpose of a TSCA risk evaluation is to determine whether a chemical presents \nunreasonable risk that triggers the need for re gulation, not to prejudge potential regulatory \noptions. Congress separated EPA\u2019s decisions abou t how to manage unreasonable risk into a \ndistinct regulatory proce ss that follows the completion of a risk evaluation.\n331 Indeed, TSCA \nsection 6(c) enumerates factors that EPA \u201csha ll consider\u201d during the ri sk management process,332  \nwhich include \u201ccosts [and] other nonrisk fact ors\u201d that EPA is expressly precluded from \nconsidering in a TSCA risk evaluation.333 \nYet EPA blurs the line between risk eval uation and risk management by improperly \ncalculating Existing Chemical Exposure Limits (\u201cECELs\u201d)\u2014a risk mana gement tool\u2014in its \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation. Appendix N of the dr aft risk evaluation contains a \u201cDraft [ECEL]\u201d \nthat \u201cmay be used to support risk manageme nt efforts for TCEP under TSCA section 6(a).\u201d334  \nEPA even evaluates whether TCEP would be dete ctable at the draft ECEL value using existing \nair sampling methods, a \u201cnonrisk factor[]\u201d that EPA is barred from considering at this stage.335 \nNotably, EPA does not discuss any other risk mana gement approach in its  risk evaluation. For \ninstance, it does not consider whether engineering controls would eliminate TCEP\u2019s \nunreasonable risks to workers; whet her pretreatment requirements or other dispos al regulations \nwould address TCEP\u2019s disposal related risks; or whether a ba n on the manufacturing, processing, \nand commercial distribution of TCEP would be  more effective than EPA\u2019s draft ECEL. The \nanalysis of potential ECELs in the draft risk  evaluation suggests that EPA has impermissibly \nprejudged potential risk management measures, well before the risk management process has \neven begun. \nIn addition to being premature, EPA\u2019s draf t ECELs are underprotec tive and inconsistent \nwith TSCA\u2019s requirement to regulate TCEP \u201cto the extent necessary so that [it] no longer \npresents [unreasonable] risk.\u201d336 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL of 0.09 mg/m3 TCEP, measured over an \neight-hour time-weighted average,337 falls short of that statutor y requirement. EPA determined \nthe draft ECEL based on the level of TCEP expos ures that are estimated to keep occupational \n \n331 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(a)\u2013(b). \n332 Id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2). \n333 Id. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A) (prohibiting EPA from consider ing \u201ccosts or other nonrisk factors\u201d during \nthe risk evaluation stage); id. \u00a7 2605(c)(2)(A)(iv)(II) (r equiring EPA to consider \u201cthe costs and \nbenefits of the proposed and final regulatory  action\u201d during the risk  management stage). \n334 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation  at 568. \n335 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2604(b)(4)(A). \n336 Id. \u00a7 2605(a). \n337 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 568. \n51 \n cancer risks at or below 1-in-10,000,338 a benchmark that accepts far greater occupational cancer \nrisks than EPA has found acceptable for consumers or the general public. Further, in calculating \nthat level, EPA assumes that workers would be  exposed to TCEP from a single exposure route \n(inhalation), via a single condition of use, without any out-of-w ork exposures from TCEP in their \nhomes or environment.339 EPA\u2019s draft ECEL would thus fail to eliminate unreasonable risks to \nworkers who are exposed to TCEP on and off the job, or, for example, fro m dermal contact as \nwell as inhalation. EPA also fails  to address how it plans to implement and enforce an ECEL \nwhen, by its own account, EPA has no idea where TCEP is manufactured and used. However, \nthose questions and others should be addressed during the TSCA ri sk management process, when \na proposed ECEL can be compared to other risk  management options. In  the meantime, draft \nECELs have no place in the TCEP risk evaluation.  \nX.  EPA Should Publish a Non-Technical Su mmary of the Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation \nThat Adheres to EPA Guidance and Best Practices on Risk Communication   \nThe TSCA risk evaluation rule requires \u201cEPA . . . to provide public access to . . . [a] \nnontechnical summary of the risk evaluation.\u201d340 The non-technical summa ry must allow people \nwho are adversely impacted by the chemical undergoing evaluation, su ch as workers, consumers, \nand residents of fenceline communities, to readily  identify what potential risks they face and how \nEPA calculated those risks. However, EPA did not provide a non-technical summary alongside \nthe draft TCEP risk evaluation. Th e closest that EPA comes to such  a summary is an overview of \nkey points at the beginning of a select number of chapters.341 Even then, these chapter summaries \nuse technical jargon and are difficult for the ge neral public to understand, and do not suffice as a \nsubstitute for the non-techni cal summary required by TSCA\u2019s  implementing regulations.342  \nEPA should have published a non-technical summary alongside the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation. Doing so would allow workers, co nsumers, and communitie s impacted by TCEP \nexposures to not only better unders tand the results of the TCEP risk  evaluation, but also to better \nengage in the comment period, whic h is the only formal opportunity  to express their views on the \nTCEP risk evaluation. By foregoing a non-technical summary at the draft risk evaluation stage, \nEPA fails to effectively communicate the results of the draft TCEP risk evaluation to people \nexposed to the chemical and fa cilitate their enga gement in the public  comment process. \n In addition to publishing a non-technical  summary, EPA should have conducted \nmeaningful outreach to tribes, fenceline co mmunities, labor unions , and other exposed \n \n338 Id. at 569. \n339 Id.  \n340 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.51(d). \n341 See, e.g.,  Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 39. \n342 See, e.g., id. at 157 (\u201cFor OESs that do not have data , EPA used relevant generic scenario \nand/or emission scenario documents to identify worker activities and exposure routes that are \nreasonably expected to occur.

In order to achieve effective risk \ncommunication, EPA must engage multiple impacted groups early in the risk evaluation process, \nas opposed to the end, and solicit th eir feedback on what informati on should be included in the \nnon-technical summaries, as well as the preferre d form and manner in wh ich the information is \ndelivered.344 \n Furthermore, we advise EPA to, at a minimum, adhere to the following risk \ncommunication principles recommended by EPA in the past and by the In terstate Technology and \nRegulatory Council (\u201cITRC\u201d).\n345 EPA should simplify its langu age in order to make non-\ntechnical summaries more digestible, and it should refrain from using any legal or scientific jargon. As mentioned above, in the chapter su mmaries included in the draft TCEP risk \nevaluation, EPA uses scientific, legal, and t echnical terms with which a layperson may be \nunfamiliar.\n346 EPA guidance from 2007 on risk communicat ion advises \u201ctranslat[ing] technical \nterms . . . into everyday language the public can ea sily understand,\u201d \u201cavoid[ ing] . . . jargon,\u201d and \n\u201cwrit[ing] short sentences.\u201d347 Similarly, the ITRC publishe d guidance regarding risk \ncommunication advises that writing for fact shee ts should be at \u201ca sixt h-grade comprehension \nlevel.\u201d348 EPA should do the same in its non-techni cal summary of the risk evaluation. \n \nEPA should also organize its summaries in a way that is easy fo r readers to process \ninformation. EPA should consider organizing its non-technical summaries in more reader-\n \n343 The recommended outreach to tribes to support effective risk communication is distinct from, \nand not a substitute for, EPA\u2019s obligation to e ngage in meaningful government-to-government \nconsultation with tribes concerni ng the TCEP risk evaluation.  \n344 See Mem. from Richard L.

As mentioned supra , EPA does not have \ninformation on where  TCEP is being released despite having  had more than sufficient time to \ncollect this data. We urge EPA to  collect this informat ion and adopt this pr actice for any future \nrisk evaluations. If EPA lacks this  information, such as is the ca se here, it should still provide \nnon-technical summaries in languag es other than English based on national statistics, such as \nfrom the U.S. Census Bureau, on language s spoken across the United States.  \n  Lastly, the information that EPA conveys through its non-technical  summaries should \ninclude the results that are most  relevant to impacted groups. EP A must provide a plain-language \nsummary of each \u201ccondition of us e\u201d so that fenceline residents, workers, and consumers can \neasily understand what processes or products can expose them to  risk, as opposed to vaguely \ndefined categories. For instance, the draft risk ev aluation says that TCEP is used in \u201cfabric and \ntextile products\u201d and \u201cfoam seating and bedding products,\u201d\n352 but it fails to specify that TCEP \nhas been detected in nursing pill ows, crib mattresses, yoga mats , and other products that people \nuse on a daily basis. We recomme nd that EPA describe the produc ts in which TCEP is found in \nmore accessible and relevant te rms, and also provide a clear and digestible illustration or \ninfographic to help the general public more eas ily understand their sources of exposure. EPA \nshould also strive to convey the results of its risk cal culations in a simple manner, so impacted \ngroups can better understand the degree of risk that they face.    We urge EPA to, at a minimum, publish a non- technical summary that adheres to the best \npractices laid forth above alongside the publishing  of the final TCEP risk evaluation, and going \nforward, to publish a non-technical summary that adheres to best practices for any future draft \nrisk evaluations in order to  increase meaningful engageme nt with impacted groups and \ncommunities.    \n \n349 See Risk Commc\u2019n Workbook at 8 (\u201cUse headings a nd other formatting techniques to provide \na clear and organized structure.); id. at 31 (\u201cMake fact sheets vi sually interesting by using \npictures, graphs, or diagrams to  accompany textual information.\u201d).   \n350 EPA, Fact Sheet, EP A\u2019 s Proposal to Limit PF AS in Drinking Water  (Mar. 2023), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-\n04/Fact%20Sheet_PFAS_NPWDR_Final_4.4.23.pdf .  \n351 ITRC FAQs.   \n352 Draft TCEP Risk Evaluation at 27. \n54 XI. The SACC Should Have the Opportunity to Review the Draft Risk Evaluation in a\nPanel Peer Review Process With a Broadened Charge\nInstead of a full panel review of the draft TC EP risk evaluation, EPA intends to conduct a\n\u201cletter peer review\u201d in which a small number of SACC members individually review EPA\u2019s \ndraft.353 A letter review involves no public peer review meeting, no de liberation between the \nreviewers, and thus no opportunity for experts from different backgrounds and disciplines to \ndebate points of disagreeme nt and coalesce around common recommendations. For all those \nreasons, letter review is disfavor ed by EPA and by the SACC itself and should not be used for the \ndraft TCEP risk evaluation.   \nEPA\u2019s Peer Review Handbook advises against the use of letter  peer review for \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d like draft TSCA risk evaluations.354 The Handbook defines \u201cinfluential \nscientific information\u201d (\u201cISI\u201d) as \u201cscientific information the agency reasonably can determine \nwill have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or private-\nsector decisions.\u201d355 \u201cHighly influential scientific assessm ent\u201d (\u201cHISA\u201d), a s ubset of ISI, is \ndefined as \u201ca scientific assessment that: (i) could have a pot ential impact of more than $500 \nmillion in any year, or (ii) is novel, controversial, or precedent-setting or  has significant \ninteragency interest.\u201d356 TSCA risk evaluations\u2014which are intended to inform regulatory \ndecisions and which frequently i nvolve \u201cnovel\u201d scientif ic issues with \u201csig nificant interagency \ninterest\u201d \u2014are both ISI and HISA.357  The Handbook thus recommends that such risk \nevaluations undergo full panel review: \n[P]anels are preferable for influential products because they tend to bemore deliberative than individual lette r reviews and the reviewers can help\ninform one another. Panels are valuab le when the work product is complex\nand multidisciplinary. Panel peer re view meetings may be open to the\npublic, with opportunities for public comment.\n358\nMembers of the SACC have reached the same  conclusion. The peer reviewers of EPA\u2019s \nQuantitative Human Health Approach to be Applie d in the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos Part 2  \nwere highly critical of EPA\u2019s decision to use a letter review process, which they found \u201centirely \ninconsistent with the 40-year hist ory of EPA Science Advisory Pane ls\u201d and contrary to the \u201clegal \n353 Tris(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate; Draft Risk Eval uation Under the Toxic S ubstances Control Act \n(TSCA); Letter Peer Review; Notice of Availabi lity, Public Meeting and Request for Comment, \n88 Fed.

TCEP should not be \nthe first. According to EPA, there are several \u201cn ovel\u201d aspects of the draft TCEP risk evaluation\u2014\nincluding EPA\u2019s approach to estimating aeria l deposition of TCEP, exposures to TCEP in \nbreastmilk, and drinking water cont amination from landfill leachate\u2014that EPA is using \u201cfor the \nfirst time\u201d under TSCA.\n362 Those issues and others would be nefit from the consideration and \ninput of the full SACC. EPA has ample time to schedule and conduc t a panel review of the draft \nTCEP risk evaluation, which can be held virtua lly consistent with EPA\u2019s post-2020 practice. We \nurge EPA to do so.   We are also concerned by the narrow char ge that EPA provided to prospective peer \nreviewers.\n363 EPA seeks input on discrete aspects of its  risk evaluation, such as \u201cthe approach \nthat EPA/OPPT took . . . to estimate anaerobic degradation\u201d and \u201chow EPA/OPPT calculated the \nHC 05,\u201d364 while ignoring the majo r uncertainties and data gaps th at EPA itself identified in its \nevaluation. For instance, EPA claims  that it \u201cdoes not have suffic ient information to determine \nwhether [six conditions of use] contribute to TCEP\u2019s unreasonable ri sks,\u201d but it has not solicited \nthe SACC\u2019s advice on how it could fill those ga ps or otherwise cal culate those risks.365  EPA also \nsays that it \u201cwas not able to quantify releases of TCEP that could occur during the recycling of e-\nwaste,\u201d366 but it has not asked whethe r the SACC is aware of any da ta or methods that could \naddress that exposure pathway. Wherever EPA has identified uncertainties or data gaps, it should \nseek the SACC\u2019s advice on how to address them, along with a broader so licitation of feedback \non the strengths and weaknesses of the draft ri sk evaluation that extends beyond the narrowly \ntailored questions in the draft charge.   \n \n359 EPA, Peer Reviewer Comments on the White Pape r: Quantitative Human Health Approach to \nbe Applied in the Risk Evaluation for Asbest os Part 2\u2014 Supplemental Evaluation including \nLegacy Uses and Associated Disposals of Asbestos  15, 34 (Dec. 26, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/ document/EPA-HQ-OPPT-2023-0309-0020 .  \n360 Id. at 34. \n361 Id. at 15; see also id. at 34 (explaining that \u201cit is  particularly critical that true experts, who \nhave spent one, two or three decades evaluating the 16 or more relevant epidemiology studies, \nmeet with one another to discuss the st rengths and weaknesses of each study\u201d). \n362 88 Fed.

Reg. 9088  (\u201cSupplemental Proposal\u201d).   \nPCA, founded in 1916, is the premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence \norganization serving the majority of America\u2019s cement manufacturers.  The Association promotes \nsafety, sustainability, and innovation in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous \nimprovement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and generally promotes economic \ngrowth and sound infra structure investment.  The cement and concrete industry, directly and \nindirectly, employs more than 600,000 people in the United States , contributes more than $100 \nbillion to our economy each year, and is playing a key role in delivering on the infrastructure investments provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  \nI. Introduction  \nOn January 5, 2023, EPA proposed to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants  \n(\u201cInitial Proposal\u201d),\n1 to address unregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d)  in response to the \n \n1 National Emission Sta ndar ds for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed. Reg. 805 (Jan. 5, 2023).  \n \n \ncourt decision Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. \n2020) .  In LEAN , the court held that EPA must address unregulated emissions from a major source \ncategory when the Agency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk \nand Technology Review (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 , but did not \naddress certain HAPs.2  Based on the data collected for the RTR,3 EPA proposed maximum \nachievable control technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), \norganic HAP (which EPA proposed to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and dioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).  \nPCA submitted comments on the Initial Proposal on February 21, 2023  (attached here as \nAttachment A) .  In its prior  submittal , PCA commented  that: \n\u2022 EPA appropriately proposed to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln configuration;  \n\u2022 EPA should use sufficient data sets when performing the MACT floor analysis;  \n\u2022 EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice standard is appropriate;  \n\u2022 EPA must consider the cost of further  emission  reductions; and  \n\u2022 EPA should make the proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register  notice.  \nOn February 9, 2024, EPA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.\n4  In the \nSupplemental Proposal, EPA proposed, among other  issues , to: (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by \nproduct,5 and (2) not set a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury.6 \n \n2 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and \nTechnology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020).  \n3 EPA\u2019s Proposal primarily relies on data collected through information collection requests (\u201cICRs\u201d) sent \nto nine companies more than six years ago for the 2020 RTR.  See  Memorandum from Matt Hakos, RTI \nInternational, to Brian Storey, EPA, on Proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor \nAnalysis for the Lime Manufacturing Plants Industry (Oct. 2022), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0135 (the \u201cMACT Floor Anal ysis Memo\u201d), at page 2 of the PDF.  EPA did not send additional ICRs for the \nProposal and only collected \u201cminor additional data provided by the industry.\u201d  Id.  \n4 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 \nFed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024) . \n5 See id. at 9091.  \n6 See id. at 9095.  \n \n \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Initial Proposal and the Supplemental Proposal may have \nsignificant implications for the Agency\u2019s  ongoing reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP \nRTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  the nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a \nsubstantial interest in how EPA is proposing to address LEAN  in the Proposals and in future \nNESHAP rulemakings.   \nPCA incorporates by reference prior issues raised in the Association\u2019s  February 21, 2023 \ncomments .  At the same time,  PCA appreciates EPA\u2019s ongoing consideration of  certain issues in \nthe Supplemental Proposal.  PCA provides the following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration, \nsupporting EPA\u2019s proposal to (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by product, and (2) not set a beyond-the-floor standard for mercury.  \nII. EPA appropriately propose s to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by \nproduct.  \n In response to comments received on the Initial Proposal, EPA now  also proposes to \nsubcategorize vertical kilns by the type of stone produced, similar to the subcategorization of rotary kilns by product.  Thus, EPA now proposes to further subcategorize by product type, specifically high calcium quicklime and dolomitic lime (and dead -burned dolomitic lime).\n7   \nPCA supports EPA\u2019s new proposal.  As discussed in PCA\u2019s comments to the Initial Proposal  \n(see Attachment  A at pages 2 \u20133), Clean Air Act Section 112(d)(1) affords the Agency broad \ndiscretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory.\u201d\n8  EPA\u2019s proposed subcategorization based on the lime product, informed by \ndiscussions with lime industry representatives and by public input, is well within the Agency\u2019s statutory authority and warranted by the circumstances.   \nMajor source categories can encompass facilities of varying kinds with significantly \ndifferent designs and operation practices necessary to manufacture a particular product that would meet unique specifications.   These differences impact facility emissions.  These differences \nalso may affect effluent gas stream conditions and compatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is thus critical that EPA take key factors fully into account so that \nemissions standards are appropriate for the ch aracteristics of each subcategory.   Failure to \nconsider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission limits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance requirements for sources that do not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \n \n7 See 89 Fed. Reg. at 9091.  \n8 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1).  \n \n \nIII. EPA appropriately propose s to not set a beyond -the-floor standard for mercury, which \nnecessarily considered the cost of further reductions.  \n EPA now proposes to decline to set a \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standard for mercury.   In \ndetermining whether more stringent, \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable , the \nAgency must consider additional factors including \u201cthe cost of achieving such emission \nreduction,\u201d \u201cany non- air quality health and environmental impacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy \nrequirements.\u201d9   \nIn the Initial Proposal, EPA proposed to set a beyond- the-floor MACT standard for \nmercury.   The Agency did so under the flawed assumption that there would be \u201czero\u201d cost of \ncompliance in installing the activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d) control technology , because , \naccording to EPA, facilities already would be installing ACI to comply with the proposed THC \nstandards.10 \n In its comments on the Initial Proposal , PCA  outlined why such an assumption was \ninappropriate  (see Attachment A at pages 5 \u20136), and now welcomes EPA\u2019s proposed \ndetermination that a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury  is not warranted .  As EPA now \nacknowledges, the control costs are simply not reasonable \u2014\u201cthe total capital investment [is \nestimated] to be $244,000,000 and total annual costs [is estimated] to be $116,000,000 per year for beyond- the-floor limits,\u201d resulting in \u201capproximately $238,000 per pou nd.\u201d\n11 \n These are real costs and cannot be written off, as was EPA\u2019s approach in the  Initial \nProposal .  While EPA previously determined that the additional cost of installing controls could \nbe zero when the technology already is necessary to meet existing standards,12 or is required to \nmeet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP,13 the Initial Proposal\u2019 s cost assumption was \npredicated on the premise  that controls would  be installed to address a proposed limit for a \ndifferent  HAP.   Such a leap  would violate EPA\u2019s duty to \u201c consider[] the cost of achieving such \nemission reduction\u201d14 for mercury specifically (since the cost consideration was based on THCs).  \n \n9 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n10 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812.  \n11 89 Fed. Reg. at 9095 (\u201cWe do not consider the control costs to be reasonable compared to other rules \nwhere we have regulated mercury and costs are consideration.\u201d).  \n12 See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, \nand Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, 87 Fed. Reg. 60,816 (Oct. 6, 2022) (Proposed Rule).  \n13 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (\u201cIn the case of the quick lime and dolomitic lime subcategories, the new and \nexisting MACT floor limits were similar in value (24.94 lb/MMton for new sources, and 25.58 lb/MMton \nfor existing sources), such that with the suggested cont rols the existing sources would be able to comply \nwith the new source standard with no additional costs.\u201d).  \n14 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d).  \n \n \nAdditionally, because the proposed emission limit for THCs might not be finalized as originally \npresented  (EPA may revise the limits or choose not to implement the limits at all), any deviation \nfrom the proposal would present unconsidered cost implications.  PCA appreciates the Agency\u2019s \nrevised approach to conform its beyond- the-floor analysis to the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct and consider costs of mercury emission reduction.  \n* * * \nPCA appreciates the opportunity to provide comment s on the Supplemental Proposal.

Introduction  \nEPA is proposing to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants to address \nunregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) in response to a  decision by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. C ircuit\u201d) in Louisiana Environmental Action \n \n \nNetwork v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d. 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020).1  In LEAN , the D.C. Circuit held that EPA \nhas an obligation to address unregulated emissions from a major source category when the \nAgency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk and Technology \nReview (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 (\u201cLime RTR\u201d) but did not address \nunregulated HAPs.2  Based on data collected for the RTR,3 EPA is proposing maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), organic \nHAP (which EPA proposes to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and \ndioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).4 \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Proposal ma y have significant implications for the similar and \nupcoming reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP RTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  \nthe nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a substantial interest in how EPA is \nproposing to address LEAN in the Proposal and in future NESHAP rulemakings.  PCA requested an \nextension of the Proposal\u2019s comment period on February 3, 2023, to allow stakeholders like PCA \nsufficient time to evaluate the Proposal and provide comments,5 which EPA subsequently de nied.  \nPCA reiterates the concerns raised in the extension request and, although PCA does not believe \nthat the comment period allowed stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to comment, provides \nthe following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration.  \nII. EPA appropriat ely proposes to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln \nconfiguration.  \nEPA is proposing to subcategorize lime manufacturing sources based on kiln configuration \nfor purposes of the proposed HCl and mercury standards.6  Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d)  section \n112(d)(1) affords EPA the broad discretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of \n \n1 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed.

Major source categories can \nencompass facilities of varying sizes with significantly different designs and varying operational \npractices necessary to manufacture p roduct meeting unique specifications.  These differences \nimpact facility emissions.  These differences also may affect effluent gas stream conditions and \ncompatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is critical that EPA take key \nfactors fully into account so that emissions standards are appropriate for the characteristics of \neach subcategory.  Failure to consider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission \nlimits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance re quirements for sources that \ndo not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \nIII. Sufficient data sets must be used when performing the MACT floor analysis.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis relied on limited emissions data from stack tests performed, in \nsome cases, more than two decades ago7 and ignored some historically valid test data.8  The D.C. \nCircuit has recognized that \u201cit would be arbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a MACT floor based \non intentionally skewed data.\u201d9  EPA\u2019s data collection does not have to result in a perfect dataset, \nbut the process must be reasonable.10  EPA\u2019s data collection here does not appear to be \nreasonable.  In contrast to EPA\u2019s dataset in the NESHAP for electric generating units that was \ndetermined to be reasonable in White Stallion , which involved data collection from over 300 \nemitting units,11 for the current Proposal EPA relied on a very small dataset that appears to skew \ninferences about the best -performing units.  For categories or subca tegories containing 30 or \nmore sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the best performing 12 percent for which EPA \nhas emissions information.12  Because EPA relied on an unreasonably limited dataset, EPA has \nproposed MACT floors for some subcategories ba sed on data from far less than 12 percent of the \nsources in the subcategories: the mercury limit for the \u201cquick lime dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d \nreflected a floor determination based on only two tests and the HCl limit for the \u201cpreheater rotary \n \n7 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at 2 (\u201c The test data submitted through the 2017 ICR was used (in \nconjunction with minor  additional data provided by the industry) to develop the proposed standards .\u201d). \n8 HCl emissions test data obtained via the ASTM D6735 -01 test method was excluded even though the \ntest method was valid at the time of use.  \n9 White Stallion Energy Ctr., LLC v. EPA , 748 F.3d 1222, 1247 (D.C. Cir. 2014),  rev\u2019d sub nom.  Michigan v. \nEPA, 576 U .S. 743  (2015).  \n10 See id. at 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2014)  (\u201cIn short, EPA\u2019s data -collection process was reasonable, even if it may \nnot have resulted in a perfect dataset.\u201d).  \n11 See id. at 1247 . \n12 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A).  \n \n \nkiln quick lime subcategory\u201d is based on a single test from a single source.13  For categories or \nsubcategories containing less than 30 sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the five best \nperforming sources.14  EPA\u2019s limited dataset resulted in MACT floors for the se smaller \nsubcategories being based on far fewer than five sources.  \nIV. EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice \nstandard is appropriate.  \nIn certain instances as provided in CAA section 112(h), EPA may set work practice \nstandards in lieu of numerical emission standards.15  EPA has determined that work practice \nstandards are justified in lieu of emission limits when at least 55 percent of the test data are \ndetermined to be non -detect following the methods specified by EPA in a 2014 memorandum.16  \nWhen assessing non -detect data, EPA should not discard reliable data, particularly in \ncircumstances where available data already is limited, as is the case here.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis for D/F presents three -run test result ave rages for two sources, \nasserts the MACT pool is one source, and then calculates an emission limit for D/F using the upper \nprediction limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) method for all new and existing kilns based on three test runs from one \nkiln.17  EPA also had test data for f ive additional kilns, but each test report had only one valid test \nrun. EPA \u201cdetermined that these one -run tests were valid for estimating expected emission rates, \nbut were not valid for use in determining proposed standards using the UPL method\u201d because \nthat \u201cvariability cannot be assessed with less than three runs.\u201d18  \n \n \n13 See, e.g. , MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 15 of PDF.  \n14 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  \n15 Id. \u00a7 7412(h).  \n16 See Steffan  Johnson, EPA, to SPPD Rule Writers, EPA, on Determination Of \u201cNon -Detect\u201d From EPA \nMethod 29 (Multi -Metals) and EPA Method 23 (Dioxin/Furan) Test Data When Evaluating the Setting of \nMACT Floors Versus Establishing Work Practice Standards (June 5, 2014), D ocket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015 -0117.  \n17 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  This set of tests was performed in 1996 at a kiln \nequipped with an archaic \u201cwet fan PM scrubber .\u201d See EPA,  FINAL REPORT \u2013 VOLUME I OF II LIME MANUFACTURING \nEMISSIO NS TEST REPORT CHEMICAL LIME COMPANY (FORMERLY EASTERN RIDGE LIME COMPANY ) RIPPLEMEAD , VIRGINIA , \nEPA-454/R -99-044a, at 2 -1, 3-2,  (Sep. 1999), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0079. The plant ceased \noperation prior to promulgation of the original Lime MACT.  See Email from Jonathan  De\u2019Ath , National \nLime Association,  to Brian Storey , EPA,  on Summary of Information Requested (Feb. 23, 2022), Docket No. \nEPA-HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0103 (confirming closure of Eastern Ridge facility around 2000).  \n18 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  \n \n \nWhen subsequently evaluating whether a work practice standard for D/F was appropriate \ninstead of a numerical emission standard, EPA should have considered all available test runs.  \nEven if the one -run tests were unsuitable for the UPL calculation, there is no reason to exclude \nthem from the run -by-run analysis of test results for consideration of a work practice standard.  \nAs EPA itself recognized, the one -run tests were valid for es timating emission rates.19  EPA instead \nrelied on only two three -run tests when determining whether a work practice standard was \nappropriate.  Of the six runs, three (50 percent) fell below the detection limit and three fell above \nthe detection limit (50 p ercent).  Because less than 55 percent of the data were non -detect, EPA \nproposes to determine that a work practice standard is inappropriate.  Had EPA included the five \none-run tests, EPA likely would have reached the opposite conclusion: 55 percent or mor e of the \ntests would very likely have fallen below the detection limit, thus justifying a work practice \nstandard in lieu of emissions standards.20  All valid data should be used when evaluating the need \nfor work practice standards.  \nV. EPA must consider the c ost of further reductions.  \nIn addition to determining the MACT floor, EPA also must consider whether more \nstringent, \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable.  In determining whether a beyond -\nthe-floor standard is \u201cachievable,\u201d the Agency must cons ider additional factors including \u201cthe \ncost of achieving such emission reduction,\u201d \u201cany non -air quality health and environmental \nimpacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy requirements.\u201d21  EPA does not appear to have fully assessed all costs in \nits proposed beyond -the-floor a nalysis for mercury for the \u201cdead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory.\u201d  In evaluating this beyond -the-floor standard, EPA failed to fully assess the actual \ncosts of compliance, which would require installing activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d).  Instead, \nEPA relied on the assumption that these facilities already will be installing ACI to comply with the \nproposed THC standards.  According to the Proposal,  \nBecause facilities will incur costs associated with controlling THC emissions, we \ndid not double -count tho se costs when assessing the dead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory, where ACI controls are used to reduce their mercury emissions \nbeyond the calculated MACT floor. The total annual costs for the dead burned \ndolomitic lime subcategory to go beyond the MACT floor by installing ACI controls \nis, therefore, zero , due to these sources already installing ACI controls to comply \nwith the THC MACT floor limits.22 \n \n19 Id. \n20 The exact percentage cannot be calculated because EPA did not include the five one -run tests in the \ndocket.  \n21 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n22 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (emphasis added).  \n \n \nSuch a beyond -the-floor analysis is improper by failing to account for a necessary factor \n(cost) in the beyond -the-floor analysis.  EPA has previously determined that the additional cost \nof installing controls is zero when the technology already was necess ary to meet existing \nstandards,23 or was required to meet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP.24  But here, EPA \nimproperly relies on the assumption that controls will be installed to address a proposed  limit for \na different  HAP.  EPA\u2019s \u201cconsideration [of] the cost of achieving such emission reduction\u201d for THC \ndoes not absolve the Agency of its obligat ion to account for costs when considering what limits \nare achievable for mercury.25  \nFurthermore, it is not a foregone conclusion that a proposed emission limit will be \nfinalized as proposed.  EPA may revise the limits or may choose not to implement the li mits at \nall.  In that event, the costs of achieving the finalized beyond -the-floor mercury limits for the \n\u201cdead burned dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d will not be zero.  In fact, the costs associated with \nadditional reductions in mercury may not be cost -effect ive and therefore unreasonable to justify \na beyond -the-floor standard.   \nVI. EPA should make proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register notice.  \nBoth the CAA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) require that EPA provide \nsufficient notice  and opportunity to comment on proposed rules.26  Under the APA, agencies \nmust include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects \nand issues involved\u201d in a Federal Register  notice of proposed rulemaking.27  However , if an agency \nchooses to publish only the description of the subjects and issues involved as EPA did here, the \ninformation contained in the notice must offer stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to offer \ninformed comments.28  EPA\u2019s Proposal fails to prov ide such an opportunity.  \n \n23 See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, \nand Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, 87 Fed. Reg. 60,816 (Oct. 6, 2022) (Proposed Rule) (\u201cIn all \ncases, the controls that were already installed were the same types  of controls that would be required to \nmeet either the 2013 limits or the less stringent limits calculated in the proposed rule and, therefore, no \nadditional costs would be incurred to meet the more stringent limits.\u201d).  \n24 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (\u201cIn the c ase of the quick lime and dolomitic lime subcategories, the new and \nexisting MACT floor limits were similar in value (24.94 lb/MMton for new sources, and 25.58 lb/MMton \nfor existing sources), such that with the suggested controls the existing sources would  be able to comply \nwith the new source standard with no additional costs.\u201d).  \n25 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n26 Id. \u00a7 7607(d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.  \n27 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3).  \n28 See Missouri Limestone Producers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

Reg. 9088  (\u201cSupplemental Proposal\u201d).   \nPCA, founded in 1916, is the premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence \norganization serving the majority of America\u2019s cement manufacturers.  The Association promotes \nsafety, sustainability, and innovation in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous \nimprovement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and generally promotes economic \ngrowth and sound infra structure investment.  The cement and concrete industry, directly and \nindirectly, employs more than 600,000 people in the United States , contributes more than $100 \nbillion to our economy each year, and is playing a key role in delivering on the infrastructure investments provided in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  \nI. Introduction  \nOn January 5, 2023, EPA proposed to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants  \n(\u201cInitial Proposal\u201d),\n1 to address unregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d)  in response to the \n \n1 National Emission Sta ndar ds for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed. Reg. 805 (Jan. 5, 2023).  \n \n \ncourt decision Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. \n2020) .  In LEAN , the court held that EPA must address unregulated emissions from a major source \ncategory when the Agency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk \nand Technology Review (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 , but did not \naddress certain HAPs.2  Based on the data collected for the RTR,3 EPA proposed maximum \nachievable control technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), \norganic HAP (which EPA proposed to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and dioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).  \nPCA submitted comments on the Initial Proposal on February 21, 2023  (attached here as \nAttachment A) .  In its prior  submittal , PCA commented  that: \n\u2022 EPA appropriately proposed to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln configuration;  \n\u2022 EPA should use sufficient data sets when performing the MACT floor analysis;  \n\u2022 EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice standard is appropriate;  \n\u2022 EPA must consider the cost of further  emission  reductions; and  \n\u2022 EPA should make the proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register  notice.  \nOn February 9, 2024, EPA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.\n4  In the \nSupplemental Proposal, EPA proposed, among other  issues , to: (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by \nproduct,5 and (2) not set a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury.6 \n \n2 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and \nTechnology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020).  \n3 EPA\u2019s Proposal primarily relies on data collected through information collection requests (\u201cICRs\u201d) sent \nto nine companies more than six years ago for the 2020 RTR.  See  Memorandum from Matt Hakos, RTI \nInternational, to Brian Storey, EPA, on Proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor \nAnalysis for the Lime Manufacturing Plants Industry (Oct. 2022), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0135 (the \u201cMACT Floor Anal ysis Memo\u201d), at page 2 of the PDF.  EPA did not send additional ICRs for the \nProposal and only collected \u201cminor additional data provided by the industry.\u201d  Id.  \n4 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 \nFed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024) . \n5 See id. at 9091.  \n6 See id. at 9095.  \n \n \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Initial Proposal and the Supplemental Proposal may have \nsignificant implications for the Agency\u2019s  ongoing reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP \nRTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  the nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a \nsubstantial interest in how EPA is proposing to address LEAN  in the Proposals and in future \nNESHAP rulemakings.   \nPCA incorporates by reference prior issues raised in the Association\u2019s  February 21, 2023 \ncomments .  At the same time,  PCA appreciates EPA\u2019s ongoing consideration of  certain issues in \nthe Supplemental Proposal.  PCA provides the following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration, \nsupporting EPA\u2019s proposal to (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by product, and (2) not set a beyond-the-floor standard for mercury.  \nII. EPA appropriately propose s to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by \nproduct.  \n In response to comments received on the Initial Proposal, EPA now  also proposes to \nsubcategorize vertical kilns by the type of stone produced, similar to the subcategorization of rotary kilns by product.  Thus, EPA now proposes to further subcategorize by product type, specifically high calcium quicklime and dolomitic lime (and dead -burned dolomitic lime).\n7   \nPCA supports EPA\u2019s new proposal.  As discussed in PCA\u2019s comments to the Initial Proposal  \n(see Attachment  A at pages 2 \u20133), Clean Air Act Section 112(d)(1) affords the Agency broad \ndiscretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory.\u201d\n8  EPA\u2019s proposed subcategorization based on the lime product, informed by \ndiscussions with lime industry representatives and by public input, is well within the Agency\u2019s statutory authority and warranted by the circumstances.   \nMajor source categories can encompass facilities of varying kinds with significantly \ndifferent designs and operation practices necessary to manufacture a particular product that would meet unique specifications.   These differences impact facility emissions.  These differences \nalso may affect effluent gas stream conditions and compatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is thus critical that EPA take key factors fully into account so that \nemissions standards are appropriate for the ch aracteristics of each subcategory.   Failure to \nconsider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission limits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance requirements for sources that do not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \n \n7 See 89 Fed. Reg. at 9091.  \n8 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1).  \n \n \nIII. EPA appropriately propose s to not set a beyond -the-floor standard for mercury, which \nnecessarily considered the cost of further reductions.  \n EPA now proposes to decline to set a \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standard for mercury.   In \ndetermining whether more stringent, \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable , the \nAgency must consider additional factors including \u201cthe cost of achieving such emission \nreduction,\u201d \u201cany non- air quality health and environmental impacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy \nrequirements.\u201d9   \nIn the Initial Proposal, EPA proposed to set a beyond- the-floor MACT standard for \nmercury.   The Agency did so under the flawed assumption that there would be \u201czero\u201d cost of \ncompliance in installing the activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d) control technology , because , \naccording to EPA, facilities already would be installing ACI to comply with the proposed THC \nstandards.10 \n In its comments on the Initial Proposal , PCA  outlined why such an assumption was \ninappropriate  (see Attachment A at pages 5 \u20136), and now welcomes EPA\u2019s proposed \ndetermination that a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury  is not warranted .  As EPA now \nacknowledges, the control costs are simply not reasonable \u2014\u201cthe total capital investment [is \nestimated] to be $244,000,000 and total annual costs [is estimated] to be $116,000,000 per year for beyond- the-floor limits,\u201d resulting in \u201capproximately $238,000 per pou nd.\u201d\n11 \n These are real costs and cannot be written off, as was EPA\u2019s approach in the  Initial \nProposal .  While EPA previously determined that the additional cost of installing controls could \nbe zero when the technology already is necessary to meet existing standards,12 or is required to \nmeet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP,13 the Initial Proposal\u2019 s cost assumption was \npredicated on the premise  that controls would  be installed to address a proposed limit for a \ndifferent  HAP.   Such a leap  would violate EPA\u2019s duty to \u201c consider[] the cost of achieving such \nemission reduction\u201d14 for mercury specifically (since the cost consideration was based on THCs).  \n \n9 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n10 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812.  \n11 89 Fed. Reg. at 9095 (\u201cWe do not consider the control costs to be reasonable compared to other rules \nwhere we have regulated mercury and costs are consideration.\u201d).  \n12 See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, \nand Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, 87 Fed. Reg. 60,816 (Oct. 6, 2022) (Proposed Rule).  \n13 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (\u201cIn the case of the quick lime and dolomitic lime subcategories, the new and \nexisting MACT floor limits were similar in value (24.94 lb/MMton for new sources, and 25.58 lb/MMton \nfor existing sources), such that with the suggested cont rols the existing sources would be able to comply \nwith the new source standard with no additional costs.\u201d).  \n14 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d).  \n \n \nAdditionally, because the proposed emission limit for THCs might not be finalized as originally \npresented  (EPA may revise the limits or choose not to implement the limits at all), any deviation \nfrom the proposal would present unconsidered cost implications.  PCA appreciates the Agency\u2019s \nrevised approach to conform its beyond- the-floor analysis to the requirements of the Clean Air \nAct and consider costs of mercury emission reduction.  \n* * * \nPCA appreciates the opportunity to provide comment s on the Supplemental Proposal.

Th e Association promotes \nsafety, sustainability, and innovation in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous \nimprovement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and generally promotes economic \ngrowth and sound infrastructure investment.  The cement a nd concrete industry, directly and \nindirectly, employs more than 600,000 people in the U.S., contributes more than $100 billion to \nour economy each year, and is playing a key role in delivering on the infrastructure investments \nprovided in the Bipartisan I nfrastructure Law.  \nI. Introduction  \nEPA is proposing to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants to address \nunregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) in response to a  decision by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. C ircuit\u201d) in Louisiana Environmental Action \n \n \nNetwork v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d. 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020).1  In LEAN , the D.C. Circuit held that EPA \nhas an obligation to address unregulated emissions from a major source category when the \nAgency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk and Technology \nReview (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 (\u201cLime RTR\u201d) but did not address \nunregulated HAPs.2  Based on data collected for the RTR,3 EPA is proposing maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), organic \nHAP (which EPA proposes to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and \ndioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).4 \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Proposal ma y have significant implications for the similar and \nupcoming reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP RTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  \nthe nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a substantial interest in how EPA is \nproposing to address LEAN in the Proposal and in future NESHAP rulemakings.  PCA requested an \nextension of the Proposal\u2019s comment period on February 3, 2023, to allow stakeholders like PCA \nsufficient time to evaluate the Proposal and provide comments,5 which EPA subsequently de nied.  \nPCA reiterates the concerns raised in the extension request and, although PCA does not believe \nthat the comment period allowed stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to comment, provides \nthe following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration.  \nII. EPA appropriat ely proposes to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln \nconfiguration.  \nEPA is proposing to subcategorize lime manufacturing sources based on kiln configuration \nfor purposes of the proposed HCl and mercury standards.6  Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d)  section \n112(d)(1) affords EPA the broad discretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of \n \n1 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed. Reg. 805 (Jan. 5, 2023).  \n2 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and \nTechnology Review,  85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020).  \n3 EPA\u2019s Proposal primarily relies on data collected through information collection requests (\u201cICRs\u201d) sent \nto nine companies more than six years ago for the 2020 RTR.  See Memorandum from Matt Hakos, RTI \nInternational, to Brian Storey, EPA, on Proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor \nAnalysis for the Lime Manufacturing Plants Industry (Oct. 2022), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -\n0135 (the \u201cMACT Floor Analysis Memo\u201d), at page 2 of the PDF.  EPA did not send additional ICRs for the \nProposal and only collected \u201cminor additional data provided by the industry.\u201d  Id. \n4 88 Fed. Reg. at 808.  \n5 Portland Cement Association (PCA), Request for Extension of Comment Period on the National Emission \nStandards for Hazar dous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, Docket No. EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2017 -0015 -0147 (Feb. 3, 2023).  \n6 88 Fed. Reg. at 810.   \n \n \nsources within a category or subcategory.\u201d  EPA\u2019s proposed subcategorization based on kiln \nconfiguration, informed by discussions with lime industry re presentatives, is well within EPA\u2019s \nstatutory authority and warranted by the circumstances.  Major source categories can \nencompass facilities of varying sizes with significantly different designs and varying operational \npractices necessary to manufacture p roduct meeting unique specifications.  These differences \nimpact facility emissions.  These differences also may affect effluent gas stream conditions and \ncompatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is critical that EPA take key \nfactors fully into account so that emissions standards are appropriate for the characteristics of \neach subcategory.  Failure to consider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission \nlimits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance re quirements for sources that \ndo not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \nIII. Sufficient data sets must be used when performing the MACT floor analysis.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis relied on limited emissions data from stack tests performed, in \nsome cases, more than two decades ago7 and ignored some historically valid test data.8  The D.C. \nCircuit has recognized that \u201cit would be arbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a MACT floor based \non intentionally skewed data.\u201d9  EPA\u2019s data collection does not have to result in a perfect dataset, \nbut the process must be reasonable.10  EPA\u2019s data collection here does not appear to be \nreasonable.  In contrast to EPA\u2019s dataset in the NESHAP for electric generating units that was \ndetermined to be reasonable in White Stallion , which involved data collection from over 300 \nemitting units,11 for the current Proposal EPA relied on a very small dataset that appears to skew \ninferences about the best -performing units.  For categories or subca tegories containing 30 or \nmore sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the best performing 12 percent for which EPA \nhas emissions information.12  Because EPA relied on an unreasonably limited dataset, EPA has \nproposed MACT floors for some subcategories ba sed on data from far less than 12 percent of the \nsources in the subcategories: the mercury limit for the \u201cquick lime dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d \nreflected a floor determination based on only two tests and the HCl limit for the \u201cpreheater rotary \n \n7 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at 2 (\u201c The test data submitted through the 2017 ICR was used (in \nconjunction with minor  additional data provided by the industry) to develop the proposed standards .\u201d). \n8 HCl emissions test data obtained via the ASTM D6735 -01 test method was excluded even though the \ntest method was valid at the time of use.  \n9 White Stallion Energy Ctr., LLC v. EPA , 748 F.3d 1222, 1247 (D.C. Cir. 2014),  rev\u2019d sub nom.  Michigan v. \nEPA, 576 U .S. 743  (2015).  \n10 See id. at 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2014)  (\u201cIn short, EPA\u2019s data -collection process was reasonable, even if it may \nnot have resulted in a perfect dataset.\u201d).  \n11 See id. at 1247 . \n12 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A).  \n \n \nkiln quick lime subcategory\u201d is based on a single test from a single source.13  For categories or \nsubcategories containing less than 30 sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the five best \nperforming sources.14  EPA\u2019s limited dataset resulted in MACT floors for the se smaller \nsubcategories being based on far fewer than five sources.  \nIV. EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice \nstandard is appropriate.  \nIn certain instances as provided in CAA section 112(h), EPA may set work practice \nstandards in lieu of numerical emission standards.15  EPA has determined that work practice \nstandards are justified in lieu of emission limits when at least 55 percent of the test data are \ndetermined to be non -detect following the methods specified by EPA in a 2014 memorandum.16  \nWhen assessing non -detect data, EPA should not discard reliable data, particularly in \ncircumstances where available data already is limited, as is the case here.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis for D/F presents three -run test result ave rages for two sources, \nasserts the MACT pool is one source, and then calculates an emission limit for D/F using the upper \nprediction limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) method for all new and existing kilns based on three test runs from one \nkiln.17  EPA also had test data for f ive additional kilns, but each test report had only one valid test \nrun. EPA \u201cdetermined that these one -run tests were valid for estimating expected emission rates, \nbut were not valid for use in determining proposed standards using the UPL method\u201d because \nthat \u201cvariability cannot be assessed with less than three runs.\u201d18  \n \n \n13 See, e.g. , MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 15 of PDF.  \n14 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  \n15 Id. \u00a7 7412(h).  \n16 See Steffan  Johnson, EPA, to SPPD Rule Writers, EPA, on Determination Of \u201cNon -Detect\u201d From EPA \nMethod 29 (Multi -Metals) and EPA Method 23 (Dioxin/Furan) Test Data When Evaluating the Setting of \nMACT Floors Versus Establishing Work Practice Standards (June 5, 2014), D ocket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015 -0117.  \n17 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  This set of tests was performed in 1996 at a kiln \nequipped with an archaic \u201cwet fan PM scrubber .\u201d See EPA,  FINAL REPORT \u2013 VOLUME I OF II LIME MANUFACTURING \nEMISSIO NS TEST REPORT CHEMICAL LIME COMPANY (FORMERLY EASTERN RIDGE LIME COMPANY ) RIPPLEMEAD , VIRGINIA , \nEPA-454/R -99-044a, at 2 -1, 3-2,  (Sep. 1999), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0079. The plant ceased \noperation prior to promulgation of the original Lime MACT.  See Email from Jonathan  De\u2019Ath , National \nLime Association,  to Brian Storey , EPA,  on Summary of Information Requested (Feb. 23, 2022), Docket No. \nEPA-HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0103 (confirming closure of Eastern Ridge facility around 2000).  \n18 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  \n \n \nWhen subsequently evaluating whether a work practice standard for D/F was appropriate \ninstead of a numerical emission standard, EPA should have considered all available test runs.  \nEven if the one -run tests were unsuitable for the UPL calculation, there is no reason to exclude \nthem from the run -by-run analysis of test results for consideration of a work practice standard.  \nAs EPA itself recognized, the one -run tests were valid for es timating emission rates.19  EPA instead \nrelied on only two three -run tests when determining whether a work practice standard was \nappropriate.  Of the six runs, three (50 percent) fell below the detection limit and three fell above \nthe detection limit (50 p ercent).  Because less than 55 percent of the data were non -detect, EPA \nproposes to determine that a work practice standard is inappropriate.  Had EPA included the five \none-run tests, EPA likely would have reached the opposite conclusion: 55 percent or mor e of the \ntests would very likely have fallen below the detection limit, thus justifying a work practice \nstandard in lieu of emissions standards.20  All valid data should be used when evaluating the need \nfor work practice standards.  \nV. EPA must consider the c ost of further reductions.  \nIn addition to determining the MACT floor, EPA also must consider whether more \nstringent, \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable.  In determining whether a beyond -\nthe-floor standard is \u201cachievable,\u201d the Agency must cons ider additional factors including \u201cthe \ncost of achieving such emission reduction,\u201d \u201cany non -air quality health and environmental \nimpacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy requirements.\u201d21  EPA does not appear to have fully assessed all costs in \nits proposed beyond -the-floor a nalysis for mercury for the \u201cdead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory.\u201d  In evaluating this beyond -the-floor standard, EPA failed to fully assess the actual \ncosts of compliance, which would require installing activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d).  Instead, \nEPA relied on the assumption that these facilities already will be installing ACI to comply with the \nproposed THC standards.  According to the Proposal,  \nBecause facilities will incur costs associated with controlling THC emissions, we \ndid not double -count tho se costs when assessing the dead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory, where ACI controls are used to reduce their mercury emissions \nbeyond the calculated MACT floor. The total annual costs for the dead burned \ndolomitic lime subcategory to go beyond the MACT floor by installing ACI controls \nis, therefore, zero , due to these sources already installing ACI controls to comply \nwith the THC MACT floor limits.22 \n \n19 Id. \n20 The exact percentage cannot be calculated because EPA did not include the five one -run tests in the \ndocket.  \n21 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n22 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (emphasis added).  \n \n \nSuch a beyond -the-floor analysis is improper by failing to account for a necessary factor \n(cost) in the beyond -the-floor analysis.  EPA has previously determined that the additional cost \nof installing controls is zero when the technology already was necess ary to meet existing \nstandards,23 or was required to meet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP.24  But here, EPA \nimproperly relies on the assumption that controls will be installed to address a proposed  limit for \na different  HAP.  EPA\u2019s \u201cconsideration [of] the cost of achieving such emission reduction\u201d for THC \ndoes not absolve the Agency of its obligat ion to account for costs when considering what limits \nare achievable for mercury.25  \nFurthermore, it is not a foregone conclusion that a proposed emission limit will be \nfinalized as proposed.  EPA may revise the limits or may choose not to implement the li mits at \nall.  In that event, the costs of achieving the finalized beyond -the-floor mercury limits for the \n\u201cdead burned dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d will not be zero.  In fact, the costs associated with \nadditional reductions in mercury may not be cost -effect ive and therefore unreasonable to justify \na beyond -the-floor standard.   \nVI. EPA should make proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register notice.  \nBoth the CAA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) require that EPA provide \nsufficient notice  and opportunity to comment on proposed rules.26  Under the APA, agencies \nmust include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects \nand issues involved\u201d in a Federal Register  notice of proposed rulemaking.27  However , if an agency \nchooses to publish only the description of the subjects and issues involved as EPA did here, the \ninformation contained in the notice must offer stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to offer \ninformed comments.28  EPA\u2019s Proposal fails to prov ide such an opportunity.  \n \n23 See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, \nand Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, 87 Fed. Reg. 60,816 (Oct. 6, 2022) (Proposed Rule) (\u201cIn all \ncases, the controls that were already installed were the same types  of controls that would be required to \nmeet either the 2013 limits or the less stringent limits calculated in the proposed rule and, therefore, no \nadditional costs would be incurred to meet the more stringent limits.\u201d).  \n24 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (\u201cIn the c ase of the quick lime and dolomitic lime subcategories, the new and \nexisting MACT floor limits were similar in value (24.94 lb/MMton for new sources, and 25.58 lb/MMton \nfor existing sources), such that with the suggested controls the existing sources would  be able to comply \nwith the new source standard with no additional costs.\u201d).  \n25 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n26 Id. \u00a7 7607(d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.  \n27 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3).  \n28 See Missouri Limestone Producers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

Introduction  \nOn January 5, 2023, EPA proposed to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants  \n(\u201cInitial Proposal\u201d),\n1 to address unregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d)  in response to the \n \n1 National Emission Sta ndar ds for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed. Reg. 805 (Jan. 5, 2023).  \n \n \ncourt decision Louisiana Environmental Action Network v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d 1088 (D.C. Cir. \n2020) .  In LEAN , the court held that EPA must address unregulated emissions from a major source \ncategory when the Agency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk \nand Technology Review (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 , but did not \naddress certain HAPs.2  Based on the data collected for the RTR,3 EPA proposed maximum \nachievable control technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), \norganic HAP (which EPA proposed to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and dioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).  \nPCA submitted comments on the Initial Proposal on February 21, 2023  (attached here as \nAttachment A) .  In its prior  submittal , PCA commented  that: \n\u2022 EPA appropriately proposed to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln configuration;  \n\u2022 EPA should use sufficient data sets when performing the MACT floor analysis;  \n\u2022 EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice standard is appropriate;  \n\u2022 EPA must consider the cost of further  emission  reductions; and  \n\u2022 EPA should make the proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register  notice.  \nOn February 9, 2024, EPA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.\n4  In the \nSupplemental Proposal, EPA proposed, among other  issues , to: (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by \nproduct,5 and (2) not set a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury.6 \n \n2 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and \nTechnology Review, 85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020).  \n3 EPA\u2019s Proposal primarily relies on data collected through information collection requests (\u201cICRs\u201d) sent \nto nine companies more than six years ago for the 2020 RTR.  See  Memorandum from Matt Hakos, RTI \nInternational, to Brian Storey, EPA, on Proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor \nAnalysis for the Lime Manufacturing Plants Industry (Oct. 2022), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015-\n0135 (the \u201cMACT Floor Anal ysis Memo\u201d), at page 2 of the PDF.  EPA did not send additional ICRs for the \nProposal and only collected \u201cminor additional data provided by the industry.\u201d  Id.  \n4 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 89 \nFed. Reg. 9088 (Feb. 9, 2024) . \n5 See id. at 9091.  \n6 See id. at 9095.  \n \n \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Initial Proposal and the Supplemental Proposal may have \nsignificant implications for the Agency\u2019s  ongoing reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP \nRTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  the nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a \nsubstantial interest in how EPA is proposing to address LEAN  in the Proposals and in future \nNESHAP rulemakings.   \nPCA incorporates by reference prior issues raised in the Association\u2019s  February 21, 2023 \ncomments .  At the same time,  PCA appreciates EPA\u2019s ongoing consideration of  certain issues in \nthe Supplemental Proposal.  PCA provides the following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration, \nsupporting EPA\u2019s proposal to (1) subcategorize vertical kilns by product, and (2) not set a beyond-the-floor standard for mercury.  \nII. EPA appropriately propose s to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by \nproduct.  \n In response to comments received on the Initial Proposal, EPA now  also proposes to \nsubcategorize vertical kilns by the type of stone produced, similar to the subcategorization of rotary kilns by product.  Thus, EPA now proposes to further subcategorize by product type, specifically high calcium quicklime and dolomitic lime (and dead -burned dolomitic lime).\n7   \nPCA supports EPA\u2019s new proposal.  As discussed in PCA\u2019s comments to the Initial Proposal  \n(see Attachment  A at pages 2 \u20133), Clean Air Act Section 112(d)(1) affords the Agency broad \ndiscretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory.\u201d\n8  EPA\u2019s proposed subcategorization based on the lime product, informed by \ndiscussions with lime industry representatives and by public input, is well within the Agency\u2019s statutory authority and warranted by the circumstances.   \nMajor source categories can encompass facilities of varying kinds with significantly \ndifferent designs and operation practices necessary to manufacture a particular product that would meet unique specifications.   These differences impact facility emissions.  These differences \nalso may affect effluent gas stream conditions and compatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is thus critical that EPA take key factors fully into account so that \nemissions standards are appropriate for the ch aracteristics of each subcategory.   Failure to \nconsider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission limits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance requirements for sources that do not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \n \n7 See 89 Fed. Reg. at 9091.  \n8 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(1).  \n \n \nIII. EPA appropriately propose s to not set a beyond -the-floor standard for mercury, which \nnecessarily considered the cost of further reductions.  \n EPA now proposes to decline to set a \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standard for mercury.   In \ndetermining whether more stringent, \u201cbeyond- the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable , the \nAgency must consider additional factors including \u201cthe cost of achieving such emission \nreduction,\u201d \u201cany non- air quality health and environmental impacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy \nrequirements.\u201d9   \nIn the Initial Proposal, EPA proposed to set a beyond- the-floor MACT standard for \nmercury.   The Agency did so under the flawed assumption that there would be \u201czero\u201d cost of \ncompliance in installing the activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d) control technology , because , \naccording to EPA, facilities already would be installing ACI to comply with the proposed THC \nstandards.10 \n In its comments on the Initial Proposal , PCA  outlined why such an assumption was \ninappropriate  (see Attachment A at pages 5 \u20136), and now welcomes EPA\u2019s proposed \ndetermination that a beyond- the-floor standard for mercury  is not warranted .  As EPA now \nacknowledges, the control costs are simply not reasonable \u2014\u201cthe total capital investment [is \nestimated] to be $244,000,000 and total annual costs [is estimated] to be $116,000,000 per year for beyond- the-floor limits,\u201d resulting in \u201capproximately $238,000 per pou nd.\u201d\n11 \n These are real costs and cannot be written off, as was EPA\u2019s approach in the  Initial \nProposal .  While EPA previously determined that the additional cost of installing controls could \nbe zero when the technology already is necessary to meet existing standards,12 or is required to \nmeet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP,13 the Initial Proposal\u2019 s cost assumption was \npredicated on the premise  that controls would  be installed to address a proposed limit for a \ndifferent  HAP.   Such a leap  would violate EPA\u2019s duty to \u201c consider[] the cost of achieving such \nemission reduction\u201d14 for mercury specifically (since the cost consideration was based on THCs).  \n \n9 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n10 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812.  \n11 89 Fed.

Reg. 805 (\u201cProposal\u201d).   \nPCA, founded in 1916, is the premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence \norganization serving the majority of America\u2019s cement manufacturers.  Th e Association promotes \nsafety, sustainability, and innovation in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous \nimprovement in cement manufacturing and distribution, and generally promotes economic \ngrowth and sound infrastructure investment.  The cement a nd concrete industry, directly and \nindirectly, employs more than 600,000 people in the U.S., contributes more than $100 billion to \nour economy each year, and is playing a key role in delivering on the infrastructure investments \nprovided in the Bipartisan I nfrastructure Law.  \nI. Introduction  \nEPA is proposing to amend the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants to address \nunregulated hazardous air pollutants (\u201cHAPs\u201d) in response to a  decision by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (\u201cD.C. C ircuit\u201d) in Louisiana Environmental Action \n \n \nNetwork v. EPA  (\u201cLEAN \u201d), 955 F.3d. 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020).1  In LEAN , the D.C. Circuit held that EPA \nhas an obligation to address unregulated emissions from a major source category when the \nAgency conducts its eight -year technology review.  EPA last finalized its Risk and Technology \nReview (\u201cRTR\u201d) for the lime manufacturing category in July 2020 (\u201cLime RTR\u201d) but did not address \nunregulated HAPs.2  Based on data collected for the RTR,3 EPA is proposing maximum achievable \ncontrol technology (\u201cMACT\u201d) standards for hydrogen chloride (\u201cHCl\u201d), mercury (\u201cHg\u201d), organic \nHAP (which EPA proposes to regulate using total hydrocarbons (\u201cTHC\u201d) as a surrogate), and \ndioxin/furans (\u201cD/F\u201d).4 \nEPA\u2019s final action on the Proposal ma y have significant implications for the similar and \nupcoming reconsideration of the Portland Cement NESHAP RTR.  PCA represent s the majority of  \nthe nation\u2019s cement manufacturers and, as such, has a substantial interest in how EPA is \nproposing to address LEAN in the Proposal and in future NESHAP rulemakings.  PCA requested an \nextension of the Proposal\u2019s comment period on February 3, 2023, to allow stakeholders like PCA \nsufficient time to evaluate the Proposal and provide comments,5 which EPA subsequently de nied.  \nPCA reiterates the concerns raised in the extension request and, although PCA does not believe \nthat the comment period allowed stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to comment, provides \nthe following comments for EPA\u2019s consideration.  \nII. EPA appropriat ely proposes to exercise its authority to subcategorize sources by kiln \nconfiguration.  \nEPA is proposing to subcategorize lime manufacturing sources based on kiln configuration \nfor purposes of the proposed HCl and mercury standards.6  Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d)  section \n112(d)(1) affords EPA the broad discretion to differentiate \u201camong classes, types, and sizes of \n \n1 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, 88 \nFed. Reg. 805 (Jan. 5, 2023).  \n2 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Residual Risk and \nTechnology Review,  85 Fed. Reg. 44,960 (July 24, 2020).  \n3 EPA\u2019s Proposal primarily relies on data collected through information collection requests (\u201cICRs\u201d) sent \nto nine companies more than six years ago for the 2020 RTR.  See Memorandum from Matt Hakos, RTI \nInternational, to Brian Storey, EPA, on Proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor \nAnalysis for the Lime Manufacturing Plants Industry (Oct. 2022), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -\n0135 (the \u201cMACT Floor Analysis Memo\u201d), at page 2 of the PDF.  EPA did not send additional ICRs for the \nProposal and only collected \u201cminor additional data provided by the industry.\u201d  Id. \n4 88 Fed. Reg. at 808.  \n5 Portland Cement Association (PCA), Request for Extension of Comment Period on the National Emission \nStandards for Hazar dous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments, Docket No. EPA -HQ-\nOAR -2017 -0015 -0147 (Feb. 3, 2023).  \n6 88 Fed. Reg. at 810.   \n \n \nsources within a category or subcategory.\u201d  EPA\u2019s proposed subcategorization based on kiln \nconfiguration, informed by discussions with lime industry re presentatives, is well within EPA\u2019s \nstatutory authority and warranted by the circumstances.  Major source categories can \nencompass facilities of varying sizes with significantly different designs and varying operational \npractices necessary to manufacture p roduct meeting unique specifications.  These differences \nimpact facility emissions.  These differences also may affect effluent gas stream conditions and \ncompatibility and efficiency of potential control technologies.  It is critical that EPA take key \nfactors fully into account so that emissions standards are appropriate for the characteristics of \neach subcategory.  Failure to consider subcategorization may result in inappropriate emission \nlimits for some sources, including emission limits and compliance re quirements for sources that \ndo not emit any of the targeted HAP.  \nIII. Sufficient data sets must be used when performing the MACT floor analysis.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis relied on limited emissions data from stack tests performed, in \nsome cases, more than two decades ago7 and ignored some historically valid test data.8  The D.C. \nCircuit has recognized that \u201cit would be arbitrary and capricious for EPA to set a MACT floor based \non intentionally skewed data.\u201d9  EPA\u2019s data collection does not have to result in a perfect dataset, \nbut the process must be reasonable.10  EPA\u2019s data collection here does not appear to be \nreasonable.  In contrast to EPA\u2019s dataset in the NESHAP for electric generating units that was \ndetermined to be reasonable in White Stallion , which involved data collection from over 300 \nemitting units,11 for the current Proposal EPA relied on a very small dataset that appears to skew \ninferences about the best -performing units.  For categories or subca tegories containing 30 or \nmore sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the best performing 12 percent for which EPA \nhas emissions information.12  Because EPA relied on an unreasonably limited dataset, EPA has \nproposed MACT floors for some subcategories ba sed on data from far less than 12 percent of the \nsources in the subcategories: the mercury limit for the \u201cquick lime dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d \nreflected a floor determination based on only two tests and the HCl limit for the \u201cpreheater rotary \n \n7 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at 2 (\u201c The test data submitted through the 2017 ICR was used (in \nconjunction with minor  additional data provided by the industry) to develop the proposed standards .\u201d). \n8 HCl emissions test data obtained via the ASTM D6735 -01 test method was excluded even though the \ntest method was valid at the time of use.  \n9 White Stallion Energy Ctr., LLC v. EPA , 748 F.3d 1222, 1247 (D.C. Cir. 2014),  rev\u2019d sub nom.  Michigan v. \nEPA, 576 U .S. 743  (2015).  \n10 See id. at 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2014)  (\u201cIn short, EPA\u2019s data -collection process was reasonable, even if it may \nnot have resulted in a perfect dataset.\u201d).  \n11 See id. at 1247 . \n12 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(A).  \n \n \nkiln quick lime subcategory\u201d is based on a single test from a single source.13  For categories or \nsubcategories containing less than 30 sources, EPA must base the MACT floor on the five best \nperforming sources.14  EPA\u2019s limited dataset resulted in MACT floors for the se smaller \nsubcategories being based on far fewer than five sources.  \nIV. EPA should not disregard reliable data when determining whether a work practice \nstandard is appropriate.  \nIn certain instances as provided in CAA section 112(h), EPA may set work practice \nstandards in lieu of numerical emission standards.15  EPA has determined that work practice \nstandards are justified in lieu of emission limits when at least 55 percent of the test data are \ndetermined to be non -detect following the methods specified by EPA in a 2014 memorandum.16  \nWhen assessing non -detect data, EPA should not discard reliable data, particularly in \ncircumstances where available data already is limited, as is the case here.  \nEPA\u2019s MACT floor analysis for D/F presents three -run test result ave rages for two sources, \nasserts the MACT pool is one source, and then calculates an emission limit for D/F using the upper \nprediction limit (\u201cUPL\u201d) method for all new and existing kilns based on three test runs from one \nkiln.17  EPA also had test data for f ive additional kilns, but each test report had only one valid test \nrun. EPA \u201cdetermined that these one -run tests were valid for estimating expected emission rates, \nbut were not valid for use in determining proposed standards using the UPL method\u201d because \nthat \u201cvariability cannot be assessed with less than three runs.\u201d18  \n \n \n13 See, e.g. , MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 15 of PDF.  \n14 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3)(B).  \n15 Id. \u00a7 7412(h).  \n16 See Steffan  Johnson, EPA, to SPPD Rule Writers, EPA, on Determination Of \u201cNon -Detect\u201d From EPA \nMethod 29 (Multi -Metals) and EPA Method 23 (Dioxin/Furan) Test Data When Evaluating the Setting of \nMACT Floors Versus Establishing Work Practice Standards (June 5, 2014), D ocket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015 -0117.  \n17 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  This set of tests was performed in 1996 at a kiln \nequipped with an archaic \u201cwet fan PM scrubber .\u201d See EPA,  FINAL REPORT \u2013 VOLUME I OF II LIME MANUFACTURING \nEMISSIO NS TEST REPORT CHEMICAL LIME COMPANY (FORMERLY EASTERN RIDGE LIME COMPANY ) RIPPLEMEAD , VIRGINIA , \nEPA-454/R -99-044a, at 2 -1, 3-2,  (Sep. 1999), Docket No. EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0079. The plant ceased \noperation prior to promulgation of the original Lime MACT.  See Email from Jonathan  De\u2019Ath , National \nLime Association,  to Brian Storey , EPA,  on Summary of Information Requested (Feb. 23, 2022), Docket No. \nEPA-HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0103 (confirming closure of Eastern Ridge facility around 2000).  \n18 See MACT Floor Analysis Memo, at page 22 of the PDF.  \n \n \nWhen subsequently evaluating whether a work practice standard for D/F was appropriate \ninstead of a numerical emission standard, EPA should have considered all available test runs.  \nEven if the one -run tests were unsuitable for the UPL calculation, there is no reason to exclude \nthem from the run -by-run analysis of test results for consideration of a work practice standard.  \nAs EPA itself recognized, the one -run tests were valid for es timating emission rates.19  EPA instead \nrelied on only two three -run tests when determining whether a work practice standard was \nappropriate.  Of the six runs, three (50 percent) fell below the detection limit and three fell above \nthe detection limit (50 p ercent).  Because less than 55 percent of the data were non -detect, EPA \nproposes to determine that a work practice standard is inappropriate.  Had EPA included the five \none-run tests, EPA likely would have reached the opposite conclusion: 55 percent or mor e of the \ntests would very likely have fallen below the detection limit, thus justifying a work practice \nstandard in lieu of emissions standards.20  All valid data should be used when evaluating the need \nfor work practice standards.  \nV. EPA must consider the c ost of further reductions.  \nIn addition to determining the MACT floor, EPA also must consider whether more \nstringent, \u201cbeyond -the-floor\u201d MACT standards are achievable.  In determining whether a beyond -\nthe-floor standard is \u201cachievable,\u201d the Agency must cons ider additional factors including \u201cthe \ncost of achieving such emission reduction,\u201d \u201cany non -air quality health and environmental \nimpacts,\u201d and \u201cenergy requirements.\u201d21  EPA does not appear to have fully assessed all costs in \nits proposed beyond -the-floor a nalysis for mercury for the \u201cdead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory.\u201d  In evaluating this beyond -the-floor standard, EPA failed to fully assess the actual \ncosts of compliance, which would require installing activated carbon injection (\u201cACI\u201d).  Instead, \nEPA relied on the assumption that these facilities already will be installing ACI to comply with the \nproposed THC standards.  According to the Proposal,  \nBecause facilities will incur costs associated with controlling THC emissions, we \ndid not double -count tho se costs when assessing the dead burned dolomitic lime \nsubcategory, where ACI controls are used to reduce their mercury emissions \nbeyond the calculated MACT floor. The total annual costs for the dead burned \ndolomitic lime subcategory to go beyond the MACT floor by installing ACI controls \nis, therefore, zero , due to these sources already installing ACI controls to comply \nwith the THC MACT floor limits.22 \n \n19 Id. \n20 The exact percentage cannot be calculated because EPA did not include the five one -run tests in the \ndocket.  \n21 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n22 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (emphasis added).  \n \n \nSuch a beyond -the-floor analysis is improper by failing to account for a necessary factor \n(cost) in the beyond -the-floor analysis.  EPA has previously determined that the additional cost \nof installing controls is zero when the technology already was necess ary to meet existing \nstandards,23 or was required to meet a proposed MACT floor for the same  HAP.24  But here, EPA \nimproperly relies on the assumption that controls will be installed to address a proposed  limit for \na different  HAP.  EPA\u2019s \u201cconsideration [of] the cost of achieving such emission reduction\u201d for THC \ndoes not absolve the Agency of its obligat ion to account for costs when considering what limits \nare achievable for mercury.25  \nFurthermore, it is not a foregone conclusion that a proposed emission limit will be \nfinalized as proposed.  EPA may revise the limits or may choose not to implement the li mits at \nall.  In that event, the costs of achieving the finalized beyond -the-floor mercury limits for the \n\u201cdead burned dolomitic lime subcategory\u201d will not be zero.  In fact, the costs associated with \nadditional reductions in mercury may not be cost -effect ive and therefore unreasonable to justify \na beyond -the-floor standard.   \nVI. EPA should make proposed regulatory text available in the Federal Register notice.  \nBoth the CAA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) require that EPA provide \nsufficient notice  and opportunity to comment on proposed rules.26  Under the APA, agencies \nmust include \u201ceither the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects \nand issues involved\u201d in a Federal Register  notice of proposed rulemaking.27  However , if an agency \nchooses to publish only the description of the subjects and issues involved as EPA did here, the \ninformation contained in the notice must offer stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to offer \ninformed comments.28  EPA\u2019s Proposal fails to prov ide such an opportunity.  \n \n23 See National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Sources: Industrial, Commercial, \nand Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, 87 Fed. Reg. 60,816 (Oct. 6, 2022) (Proposed Rule) (\u201cIn all \ncases, the controls that were already installed were the same types  of controls that would be required to \nmeet either the 2013 limits or the less stringent limits calculated in the proposed rule and, therefore, no \nadditional costs would be incurred to meet the more stringent limits.\u201d).  \n24 See 88 Fed. Reg. at 812 (\u201cIn the c ase of the quick lime and dolomitic lime subcategories, the new and \nexisting MACT floor limits were similar in value (24.94 lb/MMton for new sources, and 25.58 lb/MMton \nfor existing sources), such that with the suggested controls the existing sources would  be able to comply \nwith the new source standard with no additional costs.\u201d).  \n25 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2).  \n26 Id. \u00a7 7607(d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.  \n27 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3).  \n28 See Missouri Limestone Producers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

Additional flexibilities will be needed for small lime \nmanufacturing plants to meet the requirements of the proposed NESHAP, even with the agency\u2019s \namendments.   \n \nAdvocacy appreciates the EPA including multiple recommendations from the  Small Business \nAdvocacy Review (SBAR) Panel  for this  rule which was convened in late 2023.3 One such \nrecommendation was taking comment on establishing a health -based emission  limit (HBEL) for \nhydrogen chloride (HCl) . Advocacy strongly supports establishment of a HBEL for HCl. This \n \n1 89 Fed. Reg. 9088  (Feb. 9, 2024 ). \n2 88 Fed.

Agency,  SBAR Panel: National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments , https://www.epa.gov/  \nreg-flex/sbar -panel -national -emission -standards -hazardous -air-pollutants -lime-manufacturing -plants  (last updated \nFeb. 9, 2024).  \n\n \n- 2 - approach will give small entities the flexibility they need to meet the proposed requirements \nwhile properly recognizing H Cl is a threshold pollutant .  \n \nAdvocacy also appreciates  the EPA \u2019s inclusion of the SBAR Panel\u2019s recommendation to \nincorporate an intra-quarry variability factor (IQV) for mercury from lime plants. However, as \nproposed, Advocacy worries that small entities will not have the flexibility they need to comply \nwith the proposed amendments. Additionally, Advocacy supports the EPA\u2019s proposed aggregate \nstandards for  organic hazardous air pollutions ( oHAPs) but recommends using an average of all \ndetection limits, as opposed to the five lowest, to generate a more accurate standard.  Also , \nAdvocacy  does not thin k the EPA has gathered enough information to warrant the proposal\u2019s \nlimits  for dioxin/fur ans (D/F)  emissions .  \nI. Background  \nA. The Office of Advocacy  \nCongress established the Office of Advocacy under Pub. L. 94 -305 to represent the views of \nsmall entities before federal agencies and Congress. Advocacy is an independent office within \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) that seeks to ensure small business  concerns  are \nheard in the federal regulatory process . Advocacy also works to ensure  that regulations do not \nunduly inhibit the ability of small entities to compete, innovate, or comply with federal laws . The \nviews expressed by Advocacy do not nec essarily reflect the views of the SBA or the \nAdministration.   \n \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),4 as amended by the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA),5 gives small entities a voice in the rulemaking process. \nFor all rules that are expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities, the RFA requires federal agencies to assess the impact of the proposed rule on \nsmall e ntities and to consider less burdensome alternatives.6 Additionally, Section 609 of the \nRFA requires the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration , and  the Environmental Protection Agency  to conduct special outreach efforts \nthrough a review panel.7 The panel must carefully consider the views of the impacted small \nentities, assess the impact of the proposed rule on small entities, and consider less burdensome \nalternatives for small entities.8 If a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities, agencies may certify the rule.9 The agency must provide a \nstatement of factual basis that adequately supports its certification.10 \n \n \n4 Pub.

The Proposed Rule  \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA is required to establish a NESHAP for \nlime manufacturing and review those standards on a regular basis. Initial standards under this \nsection are based on the emissions from best performers in an industry.14 The statute gives the \nEPA some flexibility to set standards based on health impacts or work practice standards where \ncircumstances warrant.15 As part of the regular review, the EPA conducts a risk assessment to \ndetermine whether there remains an unreasonable risk from hazardous air pollutants16 and \nwhether technology has advanced sufficiently to justify more stringent standards.17 The EPA \nconcluded the most recent review in July 2020 and made no changes to the NESHAP  for lime \nmanufacturing plants .18 \n \nDue to an April 2020 court decision, the EPA has been reviewing all NESHAPs and setting new \nstandards for previously unregulated pollutants that were  determined to not  pose a public health \nrisk in previous rulemakings .19 The proposed rule supplements the EPA\u2019s January 5, 2023  \nproposed NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants. In that action, the EPA proposed hazardous \nair pollutant ( HAP ) emissions standards for HCl, mercury, total hydrocarbon (THC) as a \nsurrogate for oHAP, and D/F based on additional data received by the EPA.   \nII. Advocacy\u2019s Small Business Concerns  \nWhile the amendments  contain many  positive recom mendations  from the 2023 SBAR panel \ncondu cted on EPA\u2019s proposed changes to the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants, Advocacy \nhas suggested refinements .  \nA. The proposed rule  will still have a significant impact on small entities . \nIn the lime manufacturing sector, there are two small businesses . Both were represented on the \nSBAR Panel and both will be impacted by the proposed rule.  Specifically, the y will have to \n \n11 Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 , Pub. L.

Reg.  44960 (July 24, 2020).  \n19 See La. Env\u2019t Action Network  v. EPA , 955 F.3d. 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (EPA has an obligation to set standards \nfor unregulated pollutants as part of technology reviews under CAA section 112(d)(6)).  \n \n- 4 - comply with emissions requirements of four previously unregulated pollutants, possibly \nrequiring the use of new air pollution control devices.20 Additionally, periodic performance \ntesting would be required to demonstrate compliance.21 The proposal would also impose new \nreporting, recordkeeping , and other administrative requirements. The EPA has estimated that \ntotal annual costs to these small businesses from the proposed rule could  be \u201cat least 3 percent of \ntheir annual revenues.\u201d22 As such, the EPA determined that there is potential for the rule to have \na significant economic i mpact on a substantial number of small entities .23  \n \nWhile Advocacy appreciates and supports the SBAR Panel recommendations included in the \nproposal, these changes are all general in nature. They can provide positive changes to the \noverall lime manufacturing industry , but they are not specifically targeted at small businesses.  \nAdvocacy spoke with both small  businesses impacted by the proposed rule. They stated that even \nif all the rule\u2019s changes were implemented , the three -year deadline would not be enough time for \ncompliance.  \n \nThis was based on two concerns. First, as small businesses within their sector, they would not \nhave priority with  the technology vendors and consultants needed to help them meet the \nproposal\u2019s requirements. Basic market forces dictate that they would have to wait until larger \nentities  met their needs first. Second , the small businesses noted th at they  need time to evaluate \nwhich technologies can help them best comply with the NESHAP. Granting additional time \nwould allow them to evaluate which technologies w orked best for larger facilities  and invest \ntheir limited resources accordingly.   \n \nAdvocacy recommends the EPA grant the small businesses in the lime manufacturing sector \nadditional time to comply with the rule .24 \nB. The EPA should adopt a health -based standard for HCl . \nAdvocacy appreciates the EPA specifically requesting comment on the SBAR Panel\u2019s suggestion \nto consider a HB EL for HCl. A HBEL is appropriate here because the EPA concluded that HCl \nis a threshold pollutan t in 2002 .25 There has been no evidence to the contrary since this decision. \nIn the proposal, the EPA discusses Sierra Club v. EPA26 which held that  the EPA had not \nsufficiently supported its determination that , \u201cHCl is a pollutant for which a health threshold has \nbeen established.\u201d27  \n \nIn that case, the EPA was criticized by the court for not sufficiently supporting its findings \nregarding  HCl. Here, there is ample evidence to demonstrate a health -based standard is \n \n20 89 Fed. Reg.  9088,  9101 (Feb . 9, 2024).  \n21 Id. \n22 Id. \n23 Id. \n24 At a minimum, the Clean Air Act allows the Administrator to grant existing sources an additional one -year to \ncomply. See CAA \u00a7 112( i)(3).  \n25 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Lime Manufacturing Plants , 67 Fed. Reg.  78046,  \n78,055 -56 (Dec . 20, 20 02). \n26 895 F.3d 1 ( D.C. Cir. 2018).  \n27 89 Fed. Reg.  at 9,092. \n \n- 5 - appropriate for HCl. Specifically, a study by the firm Ramboll which has been submitted to the \ndocket states , \u201cHCl has not been identified as a carcinogen, either by authoritative reviews  or \nRamboll\u2019s own search of the scientific literature, despite its long history of use.\u201d28  Additionally, \nin Sierra Club v. EPA  the agency was criticized for not considering methods utilized by the \nCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA).  In this case, the EPA has already \nutilized the CalEPA methodology to evaluate lime manufacturing emissions and did not find \nunacceptable risk levels from HCl.29    \n \nA HBEL for HCl is based on the best available science and will adequately protect both public \nand ecological health.  Additionally, the small lime manufacturing plants have told Advocacy a \nHBEL for HCl will provide the flexibility needed to meet the new HCl requirements. As such, \nAdvocacy stron gly urges the EPA to adopt a HBEL for HC l. \nC. The EPA should alter  proposed rule \u2019s requirements for organic HAPs and mercury  \nto re flect the realities of the lime manufacturing industry  more accurately .  \nAdvocacy  appreciates the EPA  including flexibilities recommended by the SBAR panel \nregarding organic HAPs ( oHAP ) and mercury in the proposal. Advocacy supports the EPA \u2019s \nincorporat ion of  an aggregate  total approach to calculating oHAP s.30 This approach considers  \nthat different facilities emit  different oHAPs and appropriately sets one overall standard for the \nindustry to meet.  \n \nHowever, in developing the proposed oHAP standards, the EPA has average d the five lowest \ndetection limits  instead of using an average of all available detection limits. Advocacy \nrecommends b asing the oHAP standard on an average of all available detection limits to gain a \nmore representative picture of emissions for the lime manufacturing sector.  This approach has \nbeen used by the EPA before with the cement industry.31 Additionally, Advocacy has been told \nby small business representatives that the EPA should reexamine the proposed  oHAP standards \nto provide a maximum amount of flexibility given that with no additional controls, the current \nlevel of risk is already acceptable.  \n \nAdvocacy also commends the EPA for including the SBAR\u2019s recommendation of an  intra-quarry \nvariability factor (IQV) for mercury.32 An IQV properly considers that mercury levels may be \ndifferent throughout a single limestone deposit. As the EPA proceeds with development of an \nIQV, Advocacy recommends the agency continue to work with the lime manufacturing industry, \nincluding its small businesses, to ensure the best science and methods  are being u sed. \n \n28 Ramboll, Evaluation of the Carcinogenicity of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) and HCl  Mist (June 11, 2011) , \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document/EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015 -0073 .  \n29 U.S.  ENV\u2019T PROT.

The EPA does not have enough information to promulgate its proposed D/F \nemissions standard.  \nAdvocacy does not believe the EPA has enough information to promulgate the rule\u2019s  proposed \nD/F emissions standard.  The proposal states that the data available to the EPA \u201cconsisted of three \ntests with three te st runs each  and five tests where there was only a single test run.\u201d33 The EPA \nfurther notes that \u201cnone of the single run tests detected D/F emissions.\u201d34 Additionally, the EPA \nhas previously noted that D/F emissions from the lime industry are \u201cemitted in extremely low \nquan tities.\u201d35 \n \nGiven the current data indicating D/F emissions from the lime industry are not significant  and \nthe lack of available information  to the contrary, Advocacy does not believe the proposed  \nstandard is warranted. If the EPA wishes to pursue a D/F emissions standard, Advocacy \ncontinues to recommend  adoption of a work practice standard which would allow  small \nbusinesses to continue operating without unnecessarily changing their processes or installing \ncostly new equipment.36  \nIII.  Conclusion  \nAdvocacy appreciates the EPA convening a SBAR Panel as well as incorporating several of  its \nrecommendations into the proposed rule. Advocacy strongly advises the EPA to grant small \nbusinesses in the lime manufacturing industry additional time to comply with the proposed rule. \nAdvocacy supports the inclusion of a HBEL for HCl in the final rule and urges the EPA to work \nwith the lime manufacturing industry to further revise the proposed standards for mercury and \noHAPs.  Finally, Advocacy does not believe enough information exists to warrant a standard for \nD/F emissions.   \n  \nIf you have any questions or require additional information, please contact me or Assistant Chief \nCounsel Nick Goldstein  at (202) 772-6948  or by email at nick.goldstein @sba.gov.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n      /s/ \n \nMajor L.

Regan  \nAdministrator  \nEnvironmental Protection Agency  \nWashington, DC  \n \nRe: National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing \nPlants Amendments  (Docket ID EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015)  \n \nDear Administrator Regan : \n \nOn February 9, 2024 , the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  published a proposed rule \nentitled National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants \nAmendments .1 This letter constitutes the Office of Advocacy\u2019s (Advocacy) public comments on \nthe proposed rule.  \n \nOverall, the EPA has asked for comment on various  changes from the  January 5, 2023 proposed \nNational Emissions Standards for Hazardou s Air Pollutants  (NESHAP)  for Lime Manufacturing \nPlants.2  While  many of the changes suggested by the EPA will likely  improve the proposed lime \nmanufacturing NESHAP , they are directed at the lime manufacturing indus try as a whole, as \nopposed to small entities within the sector. Additional flexibilities will be needed for small lime \nmanufacturing plants to meet the requirements of the proposed NESHAP, even with the agency\u2019s \namendments.   \n \nAdvocacy appreciates the EPA including multiple recommendations from the  Small Business \nAdvocacy Review (SBAR) Panel  for this  rule which was convened in late 2023.3 One such \nrecommendation was taking comment on establishing a health -based emission  limit (HBEL) for \nhydrogen chloride (HCl) . Advocacy strongly supports establishment of a HBEL for HCl. This \n \n1 89 Fed. Reg. 9088  (Feb. 9, 2024 ). \n2 88 Fed. Reg. 805 (Jan . 5, 2023) . \n3 The full SBAR Panel Report  may be found  on EPA\u2019s website. U.S. Env\u2019t Prot. Agency,  SBAR Panel: National \nEmission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments , https://www.epa.gov/  \nreg-flex/sbar -panel -national -emission -standards -hazardous -air-pollutants -lime-manufacturing -plants  (last updated \nFeb. 9, 2024).  \n\n \n- 2 - approach will give small entities the flexibility they need to meet the proposed requirements \nwhile properly recognizing H Cl is a threshold pollutant .  \n \nAdvocacy also appreciates  the EPA \u2019s inclusion of the SBAR Panel\u2019s recommendation to \nincorporate an intra-quarry variability factor (IQV) for mercury from lime plants. However, as \nproposed, Advocacy worries that small entities will not have the flexibility they need to comply \nwith the proposed amendments. Additionally, Advocacy supports the EPA\u2019s proposed aggregate \nstandards for  organic hazardous air pollutions ( oHAPs) but recommends using an average of all \ndetection limits, as opposed to the five lowest, to generate a more accurate standard.  Also , \nAdvocacy  does not thin k the EPA has gathered enough information to warrant the proposal\u2019s \nlimits  for dioxin/fur ans (D/F)  emissions .  \nI. Background  \nA. The Office of Advocacy  \nCongress established the Office of Advocacy under Pub. L. 94 -305 to represent the views of \nsmall entities before federal agencies and Congress. Advocacy is an independent office within \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) that seeks to ensure small business  concerns  are \nheard in the federal regulatory process . Advocacy also works to ensure  that regulations do not \nunduly inhibit the ability of small entities to compete, innovate, or comply with federal laws . The \nviews expressed by Advocacy do not nec essarily reflect the views of the SBA or the \nAdministration.   \n \nThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),4 as amended by the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA),5 gives small entities a voice in the rulemaking process. \nFor all rules that are expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of \nsmall entities, the RFA requires federal agencies to assess the impact of the proposed rule on \nsmall e ntities and to consider less burdensome alternatives.6 Additionally, Section 609 of the \nRFA requires the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration , and  the Environmental Protection Agency  to conduct special outreach efforts \nthrough a review panel.7 The panel must carefully consider the views of the impacted small \nentities, assess the impact of the proposed rule on small entities, and consider less burdensome \nalternatives for small entities.8 If a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities, agencies may certify the rule.9 The agency must provide a \nstatement of factual basis that adequately supports its certification.10 \n \n \n4 Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (1980) (codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601 -612).  \n5 Pub. L. No. 104-121, tit. II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) (codified in scattered  sections of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7601-612). \n6 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 603.  \n7 Id. \u00a7 609.  \n8 Id. \n9 Id. \u00a7 605(b).  \n10 Id. \n \n- 3 - The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 requires agencies to give every appropriate consideration \nto comments provided by Advocacy.11 The agency must include a response to these written \ncomments in any explanation or discussion accompanying the final rule\u2019s publication in the \nFederal Register , unless the agency certifies that the public interest is not served by doing so.12 \n \nAdvocacy\u2019s comments are consistent with Congressional intent underlying the RFA, that \n\u201c[w]hen adopting regulations to protect the health, safety, and economic welfare of the nation, \nfederal agencies should seek to achieve statutory goals as effectively and  efficiently as possible \nwithout imposing unnecessary burdens on the public.\u201d13 \nB. The Proposed Rule  \nUnder Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA is required to establish a NESHAP for \nlime manufacturing and review those standards on a regular basis. Initial standards under this \nsection are based on the emissions from best performers in an industry.14 The statute gives the \nEPA some flexibility to set standards based on health impacts or work practice standards where \ncircumstances warrant.15 As part of the regular review, the EPA conducts a risk assessment to \ndetermine whether there remains an unreasonable risk from hazardous air pollutants16 and \nwhether technology has advanced sufficiently to justify more stringent standards.17 The EPA \nconcluded the most recent review in July 2020 and made no changes to the NESHAP  for lime \nmanufacturing plants .18 \n \nDue to an April 2020 court decision, the EPA has been reviewing all NESHAPs and setting new \nstandards for previously unregulated pollutants that were  determined to not  pose a public health \nrisk in previous rulemakings .19 The proposed rule supplements the EPA\u2019s January 5, 2023  \nproposed NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants. In that action, the EPA proposed hazardous \nair pollutant ( HAP ) emissions standards for HCl, mercury, total hydrocarbon (THC) as a \nsurrogate for oHAP, and D/F based on additional data received by the EPA.   \nII. Advocacy\u2019s Small Business Concerns  \nWhile the amendments  contain many  positive recom mendations  from the 2023 SBAR panel \ncondu cted on EPA\u2019s proposed changes to the NESHAP for lime manufacturing plants, Advocacy \nhas suggested refinements .  \nA. The proposed rule  will still have a significant impact on small entities . \nIn the lime manufacturing sector, there are two small businesses . Both were represented on the \nSBAR Panel and both will be impacted by the proposed rule.  Specifically, the y will have to \n \n11 Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 , Pub. L.

The EPA has estimated that \ntotal annual costs to these small businesses from the proposed rule could  be \u201cat least 3 percent of \ntheir annual revenues.\u201d22 As such, the EPA determined that there is potential for the rule to have \na significant economic i mpact on a substantial number of small entities .23  \n \nWhile Advocacy appreciates and supports the SBAR Panel recommendations included in the \nproposal, these changes are all general in nature. They can provide positive changes to the \noverall lime manufacturing industry , but they are not specifically targeted at small businesses.  \nAdvocacy spoke with both small  businesses impacted by the proposed rule. They stated that even \nif all the rule\u2019s changes were implemented , the three -year deadline would not be enough time for \ncompliance.  \n \nThis was based on two concerns. First, as small businesses within their sector, they would not \nhave priority with  the technology vendors and consultants needed to help them meet the \nproposal\u2019s requirements. Basic market forces dictate that they would have to wait until larger \nentities  met their needs first. Second , the small businesses noted th at they  need time to evaluate \nwhich technologies can help them best comply with the NESHAP. Granting additional time \nwould allow them to evaluate which technologies w orked best for larger facilities  and invest \ntheir limited resources accordingly.   \n \nAdvocacy recommends the EPA grant the small businesses in the lime manufacturing sector \nadditional time to comply with the rule .24 \nB. The EPA should adopt a health -based standard for HCl . \nAdvocacy appreciates the EPA specifically requesting comment on the SBAR Panel\u2019s suggestion \nto consider a HB EL for HCl. A HBEL is appropriate here because the EPA concluded that HCl \nis a threshold pollutan t in 2002 .25 There has been no evidence to the contrary since this decision. \nIn the proposal, the EPA discusses Sierra Club v.

    "comment_text": "Thoughts on the proposed regulation:\n\nThis proposed regulation is a valuable contribution that seeks to solve air pollution issues coming from industries often criticized to be responsible for discharging excessive pollutant emissions. Additionally, this regulation sends a strong signal about the care for public health and the environment. Such amendments highlight an undeniable necessity in developing stricter rules and effective implementation mechanisms to lessen the air pollution adverse effects. However, there are still important aspects of the law that require deeper commitments and improvements to guarantee the regulation efficiency as well as social fairness.\n\nAreas for improvement:\n\nFirst, while the set limits and compliance mechanisms laid out by the regulations provide a more comprehensive action on the targeted carbon dioxide emissions; there is still room for more stringent measures to achieve even greater reductions of pollutant emissions. In fact, EPA could work towards scrutinizing the possibilities of stricter limits based on the most up to date pollution control technologies.\n\nMoreover, the right to monitor and control are essential to ensure that the proposed amendments are observed and implemented efficiently. It is the environmental agency\u2019s responsibility to support regulators adequately with resources, such as inspections and assessments, and take strong actions including fines and penalties for manufacturers that deliberately refuse to comply with environmental regulations.\n\nFurthermore, inhabitants from close communities may be included in the decision-making process. This action will intensify transparency and encourage citizen supervision. Enabling connections with local business leaders, trade unions and their representatives, and environmental advocacy groups would be valuable to consider different ideas and concerns.\n\nIn addition to that, the EPA should set a goal of considering social justice for affected populations that have remained disadvantaged by air pollution by ensuring social justice in every aspect of the decision-making process. Indeed, disadvantaged groups and workers are most exposed to the risk of worsening health conditions, and long-lasting adverse consequences.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTo conclude, the National Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants\u2019 revisions for lime manufacturing plants is a significant improvement that is intended to curb the emissions of hazardous air pollutants and safeguard the close communities\u2019 wellness and the environment. In fact, this regulation underlines the increasing concerns over environmental protection and adverse effects of air pollution. Nevertheless, there are remaining opportunities for the EPA to enhance the effectiveness of this regulation to better protect public health, promote environmental justice, and ensure social justice and fairness.",

The lime industry contributes to air \npollution by releasing hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). In li ght of this issue, EPA has proposed \nchanges aimed at reducing HAP emissions and improving air quality by considering adverse \nimpacts to communities .  This comment examines the proposed changes and emphasizes  their \npotential  impact  and remaining gaps to pre serve environmental protection and tackle health and \nsocial justice concerns.  \n \nLegislative Framework : \n \nThe Clean Air Act (CAA)  authorizes the EPA to oversee  and evaluate  air pollution policy , as \npart of its mission to protect  public health and the environment.

However, despite regulatory efforts, HAP emissions from lime \nplants remain a major concern, requiring further revision of NESHAP in response to public \nhealth and environmental concerns  such as water and soil degr adation  directly affecting \ncommunities living near those manufacturing sites. Indeed, l ime manufacturing involves \nheating  limestone  to very high temperatures . This industrial process release s a massive quantity  \nof pollutants  in the air, notably carbon monoxide , and hazardous air pollutants . Moreover, the \ndust produced by such operations is a nother major concern , affecting the surrounding \necosystem , and posing respiratory problems for the health of nearby inhabitants. It is thus an \nindustry that requires stringent  control over its env ironmental effort to tackle air pollution  and \nrelease  of pollutants.  \n \nChanges  emphasized by this regulation : \n \nThese changes highlight several key variables, including hydrogen chloride, mercury, organic \nHAP, and D/F emission standards. These proposed changes include technical modifications to \nemission limits, consideration of health -based  emission  limits (HBELs), a longside  the \napplication of an intra-quarry variability (IQV) factor included for mercury emissions.  \n \nCompliance options:  \n \nIn addition to revising emission standards, the proposed rule introduces compliance \nmechanisms at existing facilities in the lime processing industry. These compliance measures, \nsuch as emission averages, provide facilities with the flexibility to demonstr ate compliance with \nthe revised standards in an effort to reduce the overall compliance burden , demonstrating EPA\u2019s \nwillingness  to promote emission reductions and ensure industry compliance. However, this \nregulation must ensure that these compliance mechanisms maintain strict legal standards and \ndo not compromise environmental protection objectives. Stricter policies need to be \nimplemented, and annual declarations of pollution discharges can increase scrutiny of \ncompliance with regulations imposed on such industries.  \n \nEconomic impact:  \n \nEPA has estimated the total annual cost of the proposed rule to be $174 million per year. \nAlthough these costs represent a substantial financial burden for those facilities, the federal \nagency  believes that the public health and environmental benefits resulting from the proposed \nchanges  are considerable . However, it is important to consider the economic impact of industry \ncompetition and employment, especially in areas that depend heavily on lime production. This \nlegislation should ensure that it proposes m echanisms that consider the need to regulate these \nindustries, as well as their overall financial and regulatory requirements .

Therefore,  this legislation has \nimportant implications for environmental and social justice . In fact, to deal with this important \nissue that seeks to reduce carbon emissions, and to protect  disproportionately affected \ncommunities against the adverse health effects of air pollution, the regulation may highlight the \ninterest in impact assessment to more accurately evaluated the adverse health and \nenvironmental effects affecting those close communities.  \n \nMy thoughts on the proposed regulation:  \n \nThis proposed regulation is a valuable  contribution that seeks to solve air pollution issues \ncoming from industries often criticized to be responsible for discharging excessive pollutant \nemissions.

It is critical that as a country we continue to tighten regulations on harmful emissions, and the proposed revisions to the mission limits for these harmful pollutants reflect an ongoing commitment to base the regulations on the most up-to-date, available scientific data. This is not only ensuring the protection of our environment, but also the health and wellbeing of individuals living in these areas. These tighter regulations will likely also stimulate innovation in pollution control technologies, which will lead to a spread of more sustainable practices moving forward. I feel as though I have a personal stake in supporting measures to reduce air pollution. I believe that it is the responsibility of policymakers now to protect the future of the earth for generations moving forward. I grew up appreciating the intricacies of nature, and also watching the world change within my lifetime due to climate change. I also can see the future potential of the renewable energy sector, for the jobs and economic opportunity it could create. For these reasons, I am in full support of the passage of these regulations.",

Reg. 57,738 (July 16, 2024)  )     \n______________________________)  \nRESPONSE TO NLA\u2019S PETITION FOR RECONSIDERATION \n Earlier this year , EPA published updated emission standards for the lime manufacturing \nsource category, including emission limit s for previously unregulated hazardous air pollutants.  \nThe National Lime Association (NLA) filed a petition for reconsideration  with EPA under Clean \nAir Act \u00a7  307(d)(7)(B).  EPA should promptly deny the petition, because  it does not meet the \nrequirements for reconsideration under Clean Air Act  \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B) .  \nBACKGROUND \n In July of this year, EPA published updated emission standards for the  lime \nmanufacturing source categor y. The updated  standards  finally establish ed emission limits for \npreviously unregulated hazardous air pollutants  including mercury, hydrogen chloride, \ndioxin/furans, and other organic hazardous air pollutants . EPA set each of the new limits at the \nminimum level of stringency allowed  by the Clean Air Act . See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(3).  \n \nPrior to issuing final emission limits  under \u00a7 112(d)(3) , EPA took comment on \nestablishing a n alternative  \u201chealth -based emission limit\u201d  (HBEL)  for hydrogen chloride, under  \n\u00a7 112(d)(4) , that would not have required any facility in the source category to reduce its \nemissions of hydrogen chloride at all . 89 Fed. Reg. 9,088, 9,092 (Feb. 9, 2024). See \u201c02a_HCl \nEmissions,\u201d EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0251 (showing no facilities with baseline HCl emissions \nabove 300 tons per year  or 685 pounds per hour ). \n \nNLA filed  detailed  comments urging EPA to adopt this HBEL, and environmental groups \nfiled comments opposing it. Environmental groups argued that , because the Agency lacked \nsubstantial evidence showing that hydrogen chloride is a threshold pollutant that may be regulated under  \u00a7 112(d)(4) , issuing a HBEL w ould be  arbitrary and contrary to law . See Enviro \nComments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015- 0237 (March 11, 2024). After considering the comments \nit received, including those submitted by NLA, EPA decided  not to issue the HBEL, noting that  \n\u201cadditional time is needed to evaluate the existing body of evidence regarding carcinogenicity of [hydrogen chloride] .\u201d Summary of Public Comments and Responses for National Emission \nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Lime Manufacturing Plants Amendments (June 2024), EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0267 at 93. Because of that decision, t he final rule , lawfully \n2 \n regulating hydrogen chloride and other pollutants pursuant  to \u00a7 112(d)(3) , will significantly \nreduce emissions and lower the risk of adverse health effects for communities living around lime \nmanufacturing facilities.  89 Fed. Reg. at 57,747. The benefits of the final rule  will accrue to \nhistorically disadvantaged populations , including Hispanic and Latino individuals, linguistically \nisolated households, and individuals living below the poverty line. Id. at 57,748. The rule will be \n\u201cparticularly  impactful to pregnant women, infants and children . . . since these life stages are \nespecially susceptible to exposures\u201d to toxic chemicals. Id. at 57,747.  \nAfter EPA published the final rule , NLA challenged it in the D.C. Circuit  and submitted a \npetition for  administrative  reconsideration  in September  of this year . In its  petition  for \nreconsideration , NLA assert s that because EPA did not provide an opportunity for NLA to \ncomment on the comments it received from environmental groups , the A gency must commence \nreconsideration proceedings  under Clean Air Act \u00a7  307(d)(7)(B).  Petition for Reconsideration, \nEPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0272 (September 13, 2024)  (\u201cPetition\u201d) . \n One month after initiating its legal challenge to the final rule , NLA moved to place the \nlitigation in abeyance  pending the Agency\u2019s decision on the petition for reconsideration. NLA v. \nEPA  (D.C. Cir. No. 24- 1297), Doc. 2078192 (October 3, 2024). EPA did not oppose the motion, \nand the court granted  it. NLA v. EPA, (D.C. Cir. No. 24- 1297), Doc. 2078692 (October 7, 2024).  \nBASIS FOR DENYING THE PETITION  \nI. NLA DOES NOT RAISE ANY OBJECTIONS THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN \nRAISED DURING PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT.  \nThe Clean Air Act provides : \nOnly an objection to a rule or procedure  which was raised with reasonable specificity \nduring the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised \nduring judicial review. If the  person raising an objection can demonstrate to \nthe Administrator  that it was impracticable to raise such objection within such time or if \nthe grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, the  Administrator  shall convene a proceeding for reconsideration of \nthe rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded had the information been available at the time the rule was proposed.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). \nNLA\u2019s reconsideration petition does not contain any objections to the final rule that were \nimpracticable to raise during the public comment period. To the contrary, it primarily contains \nobjections to environmental groups\u2019 comments on the proposed rule. Indeed, NLA\u2019s petition states expressly that \u201cNLA was . . . denied the opportunity to comment on . . . the NGOs\u2019 comments , so NLA is doing so through this Petition for Reconsideration.\u201d  Petition at 4 .  \nBecause objections to another party\u2019s comments are not objections to a \u201c rule or \nprocedure ,\u201d and because the material in NLA\u2019s  petition could  have been raised  during the public \ncomment period, the petition fails to establish a basis  for reconsideration under \u00a7 307(d) (7)(B). \n3 \n By expressly seeking  comment on whether it should establish a HBEL for hydrogen chloride , 89 \nFed. Reg. at 9,092, EPA  provided ample opportunity to comment on this issue, and NLA  \nsubmitted extensive comments on it in both 2023 and 2024. NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017- 0015- 0228 at 17- 18, 30-40 (March 11, 2024);  NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015- 0166 at 21- 27 (Feb. 2 1, 2023).  \nIn addition to NLA\u2019s  responses to environmental groups\u2019 comments, the  petition contains \nsome freestanding  objections that NLA already raised during the public comment periods . \nCompare NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0228 at 30- 32 (March 11, 2024) and  \nNLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015 -0166 at 21- 23 (Feb. 21, 2023) with petition at 5 -8 \n(comments repeated nearly verbatim). Because NLA raised these objections during the public \ncomment periods , they do not warrant reconsideration under \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). \nCONCLUSION \n Because NLA\u2019s petition does  not raise any objection to the final rule that could not have \nbeen raised during the public comment periods , it does not me et the requirements of  Clean Air \nAct \u00a7  307(d)(7)(B). EPA should promptly deny the petition. \n  \n"

No. 24- 1297), Doc. 2078692 (October 7, 2024).  \nBASIS FOR DENYING THE PETITION  \nI. NLA DOES NOT RAISE ANY OBJECTIONS THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN \nRAISED DURING PUBLIC NOTICE AND COMMENT.  \nThe Clean Air Act provides : \nOnly an objection to a rule or procedure  which was raised with reasonable specificity \nduring the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised \nduring judicial review. If the  person raising an objection can demonstrate to \nthe Administrator  that it was impracticable to raise such objection within such time or if \nthe grounds for such objection arose after the period for public comment (but within the time specified for judicial review) and if such objection is of central relevance to the outcome of the rule, the  Administrator  shall convene a proceeding for reconsideration of \nthe rule and provide the same procedural rights as would have been afforded had the information been available at the time the rule was proposed.  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(d)(7)(B). \nNLA\u2019s reconsideration petition does not contain any objections to the final rule that were \nimpracticable to raise during the public comment period. To the contrary, it primarily contains \nobjections to environmental groups\u2019 comments on the proposed rule. Indeed, NLA\u2019s petition states expressly that \u201cNLA was . . . denied the opportunity to comment on . . . the NGOs\u2019 comments , so NLA is doing so through this Petition for Reconsideration.\u201d  Petition at 4 .  \nBecause objections to another party\u2019s comments are not objections to a \u201c rule or \nprocedure ,\u201d and because the material in NLA\u2019s  petition could  have been raised  during the public \ncomment period, the petition fails to establish a basis  for reconsideration under \u00a7 307(d) (7)(B). \n3 \n By expressly seeking  comment on whether it should establish a HBEL for hydrogen chloride , 89 \nFed. Reg. at 9,092, EPA  provided ample opportunity to comment on this issue, and NLA  \nsubmitted extensive comments on it in both 2023 and 2024. NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -\n2017- 0015- 0228 at 17- 18, 30-40 (March 11, 2024);  NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -\n0015- 0166 at 21- 27 (Feb. 2 1, 2023).  \nIn addition to NLA\u2019s  responses to environmental groups\u2019 comments, the  petition contains \nsome freestanding  objections that NLA already raised during the public comment periods . \nCompare NLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017 -0015- 0228 at 30- 32 (March 11, 2024) and  \nNLA Comments, EPA -HQ-OAR -2017- 0015 -0166 at 21- 23 (Feb. 21, 2023) with petition at 5 -8 \n(comments repeated nearly verbatim). Because NLA raised these objections during the public \ncomment periods , they do not warrant reconsideration under \u00a7 307(d)(7)(B). \nCONCLUSION \n Because NLA\u2019s petition does  not raise any objection to the final rule that could not have \nbeen raised during the public comment periods , it does not me et the requirements of  Clean Air \nAct \u00a7  307(d)(7)(B). EPA should promptly deny the petition. \n  \n"
