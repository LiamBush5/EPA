    "section_text": "# A. Description of Aerosol Cans\n\nAerosol cans are widely used for dispensing a broad range of products including paints, solvents, pesticides, food and personal care products, and many others. The Consumer Specialty Products Association (CSPA) estimates that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015 for use by commercial and industrial facilities as well as by households.\n\nA typical aerosol can consists of several components, including (but not limited to): (1) The can or container storing both propellant and the product; (2) an actuator or button at the top of the can that is pressed to deliver the product; (3) a valve which controls delivery or flow of the product; (4) the propellant (a compressed gas or liquefied gas), which provides the pressure in the container to expel or release the product when the actuator is pressed to open the valve; (5) the product itself; and (6) a dip tube which is connected to the valve to bring the product up through the can to be released when the actuator is pressed.\n\nThe can itself is typically a small steel or aluminum container, designed to be hand-held, which is sealed with its contents under pressure. The can\u2019s design is intended to prevent unwanted releases of the contents to the environment under normal handling and storage conditions. However, when aerosol cans are mismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting increase in internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of bursting, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far above ambient environmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and be forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as a result of overheating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents of the can may readily catch fire as they are released and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u201cfireball\u201d; (2) the bottom of the can may detach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing the upper part of the can to become a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it bursts, releasing metal shards."

Retail Strategy and Aerosol Cans\n\nThe retail sector as a whole handles a very large number of diverse products, which change over time and may, in many instances, become regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA when discarded. As a result, retailers are required to make hazardous waste determinations for a variety of products being discarded at stores located across the country.\n\nIn 2014, EPA published a Notice of Data Availability (NODA) for the Retail Sector as part of the Agency\u2019s continuing efforts to better understand concerns from all stakeholders regarding RCRA\u2019s applicability to the retail sector, as well as to obtain information and feedback on issues affecting the retail sector. (79 FR 8926, February 14, 2014) In the NODA, EPA requested comment on a series of topics related to retail operations, waste management practices and management of materials that may become hazardous waste when discarded. This specifically included requests for information regarding aerosol cans (e.g., quantity generated, classification and management options, including handling as universal waste), since aerosol cans comprise a large percentage of the retail sector\u2019s hazardous waste stream. Approximately 35% of NODA commenters specifically suggested that discarded aerosol cans be managed as universal waste."

Hazardous waste batteries, certain hazardous waste pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and hazardous waste lamps are already included on the federal list of universal wastes. The universal waste regulations in 40 CFR part 273 are a set of alternative hazardous waste management standards that operate in lieu of regulation under 40 CFR parts 260 through 272 for specified hazardous wastes.\n\nHandlers and transporters who generate or manage items designated as a universal waste are subject to the management standards under 40 CFR part 273, rather than the full RCRA subtitle C regulations. Handlers include both facilities that generate universal waste and facilities that receive universal waste from other universal waste handlers, accumulate the universal waste and then send the universal waste to another handler, a destination facility or a foreign destination. Handlers do not include facilities that treat, dispose of, or recycle universal waste except as provided in the universal waste regulations. The regulations distinguish between \u201clarge quantity handlers of universal waste\u201d (those who handle more than 5,000 kilograms of total universal waste at one time) and \u201csmall quantity handlers of universal waste\u201d (those who handle 5,000 kilograms or less of universal waste at one time). The 5,000-kilogram accumulation criterion applies to the quantity of all universal wastes accumulated. The streamlined standards allow for puncturing and draining of aerosol cans by universal waste handlers."

Rationale for Proposing Aerosol Cans Be Managed Under the Universal Waste Rule\n\nEPA is proposing to add aerosol cans to the universal waste rule, because the Agency believes that this waste meets the factors that describe hazardous waste that is appropriate for management under the streamlined universal waste system. Adding aerosol cans to the universal waste rule simplifies handling and disposal of the wastes for generators, while ensuring that aerosol cans are sent to the appropriate destination facilities, where they will be managed as a hazardous waste with all applicable subtitle C requirements. Management as universal waste under the proposed requirements is also expected to facilitate environmentally sound recycling of the metal used to make the cans. The universal waste regulations include eight factors to consider in evaluating whether a waste is appropriate for inclusion in the universal waste rule. These factors, codified at 40 CFR 273.81, are to be used to determine whether regulating a particular hazardous waste under the streamlined standards would improve overall management of the waste and, therefore, whether the waste is a good candidate for the universal waste rule. As the Agency noted in the preamble to the final universal waste rule (60 FR 25513), not every factor must be met for a waste to be appropriately regulated under the universal waste system. However, consideration of all the factors should result in a conclusion that regulating a particular hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 273 will improve waste management. EPA has examined information on aerosol cans, including information submitted in the public comments on the 2014 Retail NODA."

    "section_text": "# A. Factors for Inclusion in the Universal Waste Rule\n\n1. The Waste, as Generated by a Wide Variety of Generators, Should Be a Listed or Characteristic Hazardous Waste (40 CFR 273.81(a))\n\nAs discussed in Section III, aerosol cans frequently demonstrate the hazardous characteristic for ignitability (40 CFR 261.21) due to the nature of the propellant used. In addition, the contents (propellant or product) may also cause the can to be a hazardous waste for other reasons if discarded.\n\n2. The Waste, or Category of Waste, Should Not Be Exclusive to a Particular Industry or Group of Industries, But Generated by a Wide Variety of Establishments (40 CFR 273.81(b))\n\nEPA has documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) developed for this proposal, that large and small quantity generators that manage hazardous waste aerosol cans can be found in 18 different industries (at the 2-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code level). Thus, aerosol cans are commonly generated by a wide variety of types of establishments, including households, retail and commercial businesses, office complexes, very small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial facilities.\n\n3. The Waste Should Be Generated by a Large Number of Generators and Frequently Generated in Relatively Small Quantities (40 CFR 273.81(c))\n\nAs documented in the RIA, more than 18,000 large and small quantity generators manage hazardous waste aerosol cans. Quantities generated vary depending on the type of generator and the situations associated with.\n\n4. Systems To Be Used for Collecting the Waste (Including Packaging, Marking, and Labeling Practices) Should Ensure Close Stewardship of the Waste (40 CFR 273.81(d))\n\nThe baseline universal waste requirements of notification, labeling, training, response to releases found in 40 CFR part 273 subparts B and C and the proposed specific requirements for management of aerosol cans in 40 CFR 273.13 and 40 CFR 273.33 as discussed in Section IV below are designed to ensure close stewardship of the hazardous waste aerosol cans.\n\n5. Risks Posed by the Waste During Accumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to the Risks Posed by Other Hazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards Would Be Protective of Human Health and the Environment During Accumulation and Transport (40 CFR 273.81(e))\n\nAerosol cans are designed to contain the products they hold during the periods of storage and transportation as they move from the manufacturer, to the retailer, and ultimately to the final customer. As long as they remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol cans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained as-generated under normal management conditions. In addition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is addressed by standards set by the Department of Transportation, Office of Safety and Health Administration, and local fire codes.\u00b9\u00b2\n\n10 According to California\u2019s guidance for their regulations, a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d is any person that processes aerosol cans in exchange for compensation. Some examples include: Individuals from another generator\u2019s site, registered hazardous waste transporters, operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage and/or disposal facilities, and operators of transportable treatment units.\n\n11 Public comments on the 2014 Retail NODA can be found in docket number EPA\u2013HQ\u2013RCRA\u20132012\u20130426 on regulations.gov.\n\n12 For example, DOT\u201449 CFR 173.306 for Shipping of Limited Quantities, Aerosol Cans and 49 CFR 173.115 for Flammable Gas, OSHA\u201429 CFR 1910.106(d)(6), Flammable Liquids, 2015 NFPA\u2014Chapter 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids."

Under the universal waste rule, a handler of universal waste can send the universal waste to another handler, where it can be consolidated into a larger shipment for transport to a destination facility. Therefore, under the proposed rule it would be more economical to send hazardous waste aerosol cans to recycling for recovery of metal values. EPA thus expects such management to not only advance the RCRA goal of increased resource conservation, but also to increase proper disposal as hazardous waste, making it less likely that it will be sent for improper disposal in municipal landfills or municipal incinerators. In addition, because of the streamlined structure of the universal waste rule makes aerosol can collection programs more economical, hazardous waste aerosol cans that might otherwise be sent to a municipal landfill under a VSQG or household hazardous waste exemption, would be more easily collected and consolidated for hazardous waste disposal by those who are interested in managing it this way.

Small and large quantity generators are already required to manage their hazardous waste aerosol cans under RCRA subtitle C. As a result of implementation of this rule in the states, some of these generators would likely begin managing their aerosol cans as a universal waste, either to save money or to improve implementation of their existing waste management program. One of the streamlined provisions of the universal waste rule allows consolidation of aerosol cans at central locations, which makes it easier for smaller users to arrange for hazardous waste recycling or disposal of these materials when they are generated.\n\nEPA intends to encourage individual households and VSQGs to participate in such programs, which would divert aerosol cans from the municipal waste stream."

For example, as discussed in Section II above, aerosol cans are frequently hazardous due to the ignitability characteristic, and in some cases may also contain listed hazardous waste or materials exhibiting another hazardous characteristic. If a solid waste aerosol can is determined to be non-hazardous then it is also not subject to the proposed universal waste regulations.\n\nUtah\u2019s definition of aerosol cans includes a size limitation of twenty-four ounces for aerosol cans that would qualify under their universal waste provisions. EPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that meet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system for the reasons explained in Section III above, and has not identified reasons why size would affect the considerations described.\n\nHowever, EPA requests comment on whether to include a size limit of twenty-four ounces or other type of limitations on the types of aerosol cans that would be eligible for the federal universal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit would be necessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans.

Such a limitation would be consistent with California\u2019s universal waste program. Under this option, the puncturing and draining management standards would only apply to handlers that are not commercial processors. Handlers that are commercial processors may still accept aerosol cans and process the cans by sorting and consolidating them, but would be unable to puncture and drain the cans. Under this option, commercial processors that would like to puncture and drain aerosol cans must first meet the requirements for a universal waste destination facility (including requiring a permit for storage of the hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling).\n\nHandlers would still be allowed to puncture and drain the hazardous waste aerosol cans that they generate."

The federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized state, and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities in that state, since only the state was authorized to issue RCRA permits. When EPA promulgated new, more stringent federal requirements for these pre-HSWA regulations, the state was obligated to enact equivalent authorities within specified time frames. However, the new federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized state, until the state adopted the federal requirements as state law. In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), which was added by HSWA, new requirements and prohibitions imposed under HSWA authority take effect in authorized states at the same time that they take effect in unauthorized states. EPA is directed by the statute to implement these requirements and prohibitions in authorized states, including the issuance of permits, until the state is granted authorization to do so. While states must still adopt HSWA related provisions as state law to retain final authorization, EPA implements the HSWA provisions in authorized states until the states do so.\n\nAuthorized states are required to modify their programs only when EPA enacts federal requirements that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing federal requirements. RCRA section 3009 allows the states to impose standards more stringent than those in the federal program (see also 40 CFR 271.1). Therefore, authorized states may, but are not required to, adopt federal regulations, both HSWA and non-HSWA, that are considered less stringent than previous federal regulations."

In the NPRM, TSA proposed that certain private and corporate aircraft operations should adopt security standards similar to those of commercial aircraft operations, including the use of security programs, crew vetting, and passenger watchlist matching. The NPRM also proposed new requirements for airports that serve the private and corporate operations. TSA held a series of public meetings and reviewed more than 7,000 public comments submitted in response to the NPRM. Based on all of the information received and a re-evaluation of the proposal in light of risk-based principles, TSA has decided not to pursue this rulemaking at this time."
