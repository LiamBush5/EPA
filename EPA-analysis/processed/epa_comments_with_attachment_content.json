    "comment_text": "I use a lot of hair products inside aerosol cans in my daily life, and this proposed rule caught my attention because I never put a connection between aerosol cans and environmental issues. After I did my research on aerosol cans, I discovered that aerosol cans could be dangerous under some conditions.\n\nAerosol cans are widely used as the containers of paints, hair products, pesticides, foods, etc. The design of the can is intended to prevent the unwanted releases of the contents to the environment. However, if the cans are exposed to excessive heat, the internal pressure of the can increase, which can lead to release its inside contents, some of the contents are harmful to environment. Some of the contents inside the cans are ignitable, the release of content could cause a rapidly burning vapor \"fireball\". Meanwhile, if the bottom of the can is detached under this condition, the upper part of the can might become a projectile.\n\nThe current state of the federal regulation of aerosol cans only cover the manufacture, store and disposal processes, but not covers the recycle process of aerosol cans. However, during the recycle process, accidents could happen, and we need a safer system. By adding aerosol cans to universal waste regulations, recycle process would also be subject to the regulation. I agree that this proposal will provide a clear, protective system for managing discarded cans and promote the recycling of these cans and reduce the quantity of these wastes going to our environment. Furthermore, if this proposed rule is implemented, an annual cost saving of $3.0 million to $63.3 million will be saved in the future. Consider the environmental and economic benefits could be obtained from the proposal, I support this proposed rule of adding aerosol cans to universal waste regulations.\n\nThank you for your time!",

    "comment_text": "Dear Tracy Atagi and Tiffany Kollar,\n\nI am a toxicologist and public health professional and I am in favor of this proposed rule. While I may agree that the proposed rule serves to protect environmental and human health, my concern is in regards to Section IV Part B2 Proposed Requirements and Request for Comment on Puncturing and Draining at Small and Large Quantity Handlers. In this section, EPA acknowledges that simplifying disposal procedures for aerosol cans will lead to a greater number and volume of them being sent to small and large quantity handlers for puncturing and subsequent recycling. Furthermore, under the universal waste clause, aerosol cans will be able to be stored for a longer period of time prior to disposal, thereby increasing the number of cans punctured and disposed of by a facility at once. I believe that herein lies the greatest threat to environmental protectionshow does EPA specifically propose to address aerosol can puncturing if there is a significant increase in the number of cans needing to be processed?\n\nThe technology used to puncture aerosol cans, as all technology, is imperfect. In fact, through EPAs Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program, the agency has analyzed aerosol can puncturing devices and determined that at least one puncturing technology that is currently on the market and used by handlers had a tendency to malfunction after processing significantly fewer cans than as advertised by the distributor. These malfunctions include breakthrough of volatile chemicals and failure of locking mechanisms for the machine. Basic statistics indicates that the incidence of such malfunctions will increase as the sheer number of cans processed increases, as is expected with the proposed rule. While the proposed rule suggests many preventative procedures that handlers must include at minimum in a written standard operating procedure (SOP), the document neglects to mention any worker-related protections. I believe this to be a negligent oversight on the part of EPA, as it would fail to adequately protect human health.\n\nThe proposed rule states At minimum, EPA is proposing that the written procedure address the operation and maintenance of the unit including its proper assembly; segregation of incompatible wastes; and proper waste management practices. I believe that the final rule, in order to be truly comprehensive, should also include the phrase occupational safety guidelines including required PPE in minimal requirements for a written SOP. As the number of cans processed and, therefore, the number of machine malfunctions and leaks, increase, the likelihood of accidental worker exposure to hazards also increases. As such, the EPA would not be fulfilling its duty to protect human health if it were to neglect mandating worker protections in a written operating procedure. The state of Colorado, which has already adopted aerosol cans as universal waste, specifically states precautions that need to be taken to protect the worker should be included in the mandated written operating procedure (see Attachment 1). A federal rule, then, must also specifically address worker safety.\n\nSome may argue that it is not EPAs jurisdiction to ensure worker safety, and rather that is the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, a 1991 Memorandum of Understanding between OSHA and EPA (see Attachment 2) suggests the opposite. The document emphasizes that the two agencies have overlapping authority and responsibility with regards to job site-related safety and health and indicates RCRA as one of EPAs statutes under which this is the case. As stated in the memorandum, EPA would ultimately defer to OSHA to determine if the worker safety precautions proposed in a written SOP are adequate. However, simply requiring that worker safety be taken into consideration, is not a gross overstep of EPAs jurisdiction.\n\nI commend EPA for addressing many of the potential problems related to puncturing aerosol cans. However, the agency should seriously consider the addition of worker-safety precautions in the minimum requirements for a written SOP, especially considering that the volume and number of cans processed is likely to increase as a result of the adoption of aerosol cans as universal waste.",

        "extracted_text": " \nPage 1 of 4  \nCompliance Bulletin \nHazardous Waste  \nManagement of Waste Aerosol Cans  \nreviewed/revised August 2002 \nWhich aerosol cans are regulated as hazardous \nwaste?  \nAerosol cans sometimes need to be discarded before they are completely empty.  This occurs for a variety of reasons, including when the spray mechanism no \nlonger operates as designed, the propellant is spent, or \nthe product is no longer used.  In these cases it must be determined whether the contents\n remaining in the can \nare hazardous waste, either by exhibiting a characteristic  of hazardous waste (such as ignitability \n(D001)) or  because they are a  listed waste (such as \ntrichloroethylene (U228)) [Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 261].  It is important to remember that the contents remaining in an aerosol can would not be considered spent and therefore could not carry the F-codes for spent solvents.  An aerosol can \nmay, however, carry a P- or U-code for unused \nchemical products.    While residential consumers are exempt from the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations, businesses, \nschools and government facilities that generate \nhazardous wastes must follow these requirements regarding proper management and disposal of hazardous wastes applicable for their generator category.  Generators of waste aerosol cans are responsible for determining if their wastes are \nhazardous.  If the contents of the aerosol cans are \nhazardous, they must be managed in compliance with the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations [6 CCR 1007-3].    Which aerosol cans are not\n regulated as hazardous \nwaste? \n \nAerosol cans that are still in use or that contain useable \nproduct are not yet considered wastes.  Aerosol cans that are empty or that contain materials that are not \nconsidered hazardous wastes may be managed as solid \nwaste.  \nHow should aerosol cans determined to contain \nhazardous waste be managed? \n \nIn the past, if an aerosol can contained a hazardous waste, it needed to be managed in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, \ntraining and manifesting requirements, as well as restrictive time limits. The Colorado Hazardous Waste \nCommission has adopted reduced management prac-\ntices for aerosol cans containing hazardous waste under the Universal Waste Rule.  Therefore, someone who generates aerosol cans containing hazardous waste may choose to manage these cans in full compliance with \nParts 260 through 268, Parts 99 and 100 of the Colo-\nrado Hazardous Waste Regulations, or with the re-duced requirements of Part 273, Universal Waste Rule. \n \nWhat are Universal Wastes? \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule [6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273] includes certain hazardous wastes that are commonly generated by very small to very large non-residential \nsources such as businesses, government agencies, and \nschools.  Universal wastes are subject to wide-spread \nuse, which makes disposal of these hazardous wastes difficult to control.     \n \n     \n \n Materials included as universal wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and have been required to be handled as \nhazardous wastes since the early 1980s.  In the past, if \nthese wastes were determined to be a hazardous waste, small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste needed to manage them in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, employee training, manifest requirements, and \nrestrictive time limits. [6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 260 - 268, \n99, 100]   \n \nWhy manage waste aerosol ca ns as universal waste?  \n \nManaging aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as \nuniversal wastes is most beneficial to small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste, or conditionally exempt small quantity generators that \nwould otherwise be small qua ntity generators if they \ndid not manage some of their wastes as universal \nUniversal Wastes include many: \n\uf0b7 batteries \n\uf0b7 pesticides \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing devices \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing lighting wastes \n\uf0b7 aerosol cans  \n\uf0b7 electronic devices and components \n \nPage 2 of 4 wastes.   The primary benef its of choosing the reduced \nmanagement standards of the universal waste rule are that the waste does not count toward the monthly total \nof hazardous waste in determining generator category; \nthe waste can be shipped in Colorado without a hazardous waste manifest; the waste can be shipped by common carrier instead of a hazardous waste transporter; there are reduced notification and record-keeping requirements, and the storage time limits are \nless restrictive.    \n Since universal waste does not require a hazardous waste manifest for shipment in Colorado, it is not considered hazardous waste under US Department of \nTransportation regulations.  Other states may have \nmore stringent requirements for these wastes, however, and may require use of the hazardous waste manifest.  State requirements for universal waste transporters are \nincluded in 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273 Subpart D.   \n \nWhat are the requirements for universal waste \nmanagement? \n \nCategories of Universal Waste Handlers  \n \nUnder the Universal Waste Rule, persons who generate or accumulate aerosol cans containing hazardous waste are considered \u201chandlers\u201d of universal waste. [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  [Note: this definition is different from that of a generator  of hazardous waste]. \n \nThere are two categories of handlers, Small Quantity \nHandlers of Universal Waste and Large Quantity Handlers of Universal Waste.  A small quantity handler of universal waste is one who does not accumulate more than 5,000 kilograms of universal at any one \ntime.  A large quantity handler of universal waste is a \nhandler of universal waste who accumulates 5,000 kilograms or more of universal waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  The designation of small quantity or large quantity handler of universal waste has no \nrelationship to a facility\u2019s hazardous waste generator  \nstatus.  Thus a small quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a large quantity handler of universal waste, and a facility that is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a small quantity handler of universal waste. \n \nIf, at any time during the calendar year, a facility ex-ceeds the quantities for a small quantity handler of universal waste, they woul d be considered a large \nquantity handler until the next calendar year when they \ncan reevaluate their status.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.9] Notification  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are not required to notify the Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division (the Division) of their universal \nwaste management activities.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.12]  Large quantity handlers of universal waste are required to notify the Division of their universal waste management activities and obtain an EPA identification number using EPA Form 8700-12.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.32]  This must be done even \nif the facility has previously given notification and \nreceived an EPA identification number for its hazardous waste activities.  The EPA identification number will remain the same.    \nAccumulation of Waste  \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule was designed to streamline \nthe regulatory process and encourage recycling.  \nTherefore, a handler of universal waste cannot dispose of the waste without a permit and treatment is not allowed except under certain specified conditions in Part 273 of the Colorado h azardous waste regulations \n[6 CCR 1007-3].  All handlers of universal waste are \nrequired to manage their waste in a manner that prevents releases of the waste or waste constituents.  There is a one year accumulation time limit, and handlers must be able to demonstrate that universal \nwaste on site has not been accumulated for more than \none year.  Although it is not required to be marked with the accumulation start date, this would be the easiest way to document that the waste is in compliance with the one year accumulation limit.  \nLabeling  \n \nWhen a universal waste aerosol can is generated, it must either be labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Can\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Can,\u201d or be put into an accumulation container labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Cans\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Cans.\u201d  If the \naerosol can is placed into an accumulation container, \nonly the accumulation container needs to be labeled as containing waste aerosol cans, not the individual cans within it.  If the individual aerosol can is not in good condition and is leaking or shows signs that it could leak, it must be individually over packed in a container \nthat is labeled.  If the accu mulation container is not in \ngood condition, it must be over packed or the cans must be removed and put into a container that is in good condition.  \n \nPage 3 of 4 Shipment of Waste  \n \nA universal waste handler cannot dispose of universal \nwaste on site without a permit, and treatment by the handler is not allowed exce pt under limited conditions \n(see the section on handler treatment). Universal waste \ncan only be shipped to another universal waste handler, a destination facility or a foreign destination.  Ship-ment to another universal waste handler is allowed to aid in consolidation of wastes.  A destination facility is a facility that is permitted to treat, dispose, or recycle \nthe waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9] \nShipment of universal waste in Colorado does not require the use of the hazardous waste manifest system.  Therefore, universal waste is not considered hazardous waste under US DOT regulations.  Some universal \nwastes are regulated by the US DOT as hazardous \nmaterials because they meet criteria for one or more hazard classes, but the word \"waste\" may not be used in the shipping name.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.52]   \nOther states may have different requirements for \nwastes that are managed as universal waste in \nColorado.  The handler should always confirm the regulatory status of universal wastes in the destination state and all intervening states the waste will travel through. \n \nEmployee Training  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are required \nto inform all employees who manage universal waste about the proper handling and emergency procedures appropriate to the types of universal waste at the facility.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.16] Large \nquantity handlers of universal waste are required to \nensure that personnel are thoroughly familiar with the requirements for universal waste management and emergency response relative to their level of responsibilities in dealing with the waste.  [6 CCR \n1007-3 Section 273.36] \n \nHandlers of waste aerosol cans who puncture aerosol \ncans are required to ensure that personnel thoroughly understand how to safely operate the puncturing device, as well as how to safely manage the waste \ngenerated from the puncturing operation. \n \nSpills  \n \nAll handlers of universal waste are required to \nimmediately containerize and appropriately manage any spills or residues from releases of universal wastes.  \n[6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(a), 273.37(a)]  The \nwaste generated from a release of universal waste would be considered newly generated waste, and a \nhazardous waste determination would need to be made.  If it is determined that any or all of the released \nmaterial or residue is hazardous, it must be managed in \naccordance with the hazardous waste regulations and not the universal waste requirements.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(b), 273.37(b)]  The handler of the universal waste at the time of the release would be the generator of the newly generated hazardous waste and \nmust adhere to all applicable requirements of the \nColorado hazardous waste regulations.    \nRecord Keeping Requirements  \n \nA small quantity handler of universal waste is not required to maintain records.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.19]  However, it is strongly advisable to keep \nadequate records to document waste management practices and substantiate the facility\u2019s universal waste handler status.    A large quantity handler of universal waste must keep \nwritten records for universal wastes shipped to and \nfrom its facilities.  These records must be kept for at least three years and include:  the types and quantities of universal waste shipped or received, the date the waste was shipped or received, and to whom the waste \nwas shipped.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.39]  There is \nno requirement to maintain formal training records for either category.  Transporters of universal waste are required to keep records in accordance with US DOT requirements.  A \ndestination facility is subject to all applicable \nrequirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 264-268, 99 & 100.  If the destination facility recycles the universal waste without storing it, they need only notify the Department of their activity under 6 CCR 1007-3 Part \n99 and keep records of each shipment.  If the \ndestination facility is a Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF), they are required to keep records in accordance with their hazardous waste permit.  Can a universal waste handler treat its hazardous wastes? \n \nUniversal waste handlers can\u2019t dispose of universal wastes without a permit and treatment by the handler is not allowed except under limited conditions. \n \nPuncturing waste aerosol cans  \n \nPuncturing of waste aerosol cans is allowed by \nuniversal waste handlers as long as it is conducted in accordance with the requirements of Part 273.13 or \n \nPage 4 of 4 273.33 of the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations.  \nPrior to puncturing waste aerosol cans, the handler must develop and implement a written procedure \ndetailing how to puncture the cans safely.  Included in \nthis document must be the type of equipment to be used, operation and maintenance of the equipment and the precautions that need to be taken to protect the worker.  In addition, the document must include a review of the wastes that will be generated from the \npuncturing activities and an outline of how \nincompatible wastes will be  segregated prior to and \nafter puncturing.  Special management procedures necessary to manage the waste properly, such as ensuring that flammable wastes are stored away from \nheat or open flames, also need to be evaluated prior to \npuncturing.  Additionally, this procedure must detail the frequency of filter change out, if applicable. [Note: it may be necessary to file an Air Pollution Emission Notice (APEN) for the puncturing operation and to use \ncontrol devices to capture air borne contamination.]  A \nspill kit must be readily av ailable in case wastes are \nspilled during the puncturing activities.  Once the puncturing activity occurs, the contents from the can or the puncturing device must be transferred to \na container meeting the requirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 \nSection 262.34.  At the point the material is removed from the can, it is considered a hazardous waste and must be managed in accordance with all hazardous waste regulations.  It can no longer be managed as \nuniversal waste.  The quantity of waste generated from \nthe punctured cans must be included in the determina-tion of generator status.  All applicable generator \nrequirements contained in Part 262 apply to this newly generated waste including accumulation time limits.   \nOnce the waste aerosol cans have been emptied, they \ncan be managed as a RCRA empty container and either recycled as scrap metal or disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations.  What about Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG)? \n \nConditionally exempt small quantity generators are \nthose that generate less than 100 kilograms \n(approximately 25 gallons or 250 pounds) of total \nhazardous waste and no more than one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste per calendar month AND never accumulate more th an 1000 kilograms of \nhazardous waste on site at one time.  In Colorado, \nconditionally exempt generators are not excused from \nidentifying which of their wastes are hazardous wastes and must ensure that their wastes are sent to a facility that is permitted to accept it.   Conditionally exempt small quantity generators may \nchoose to manage their aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as conditionally exempt wastes or as \nuniversal wastes. [ 6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.8 ]  \nBecause of the reduced management requirements already applicable to c onditionally exempt small \nquantity generators of hazar dous waste, it is generally \nnot to their benefit to manage their wastes as universal waste, unless they would ot herwise be small quantity \ngenerators.  Unlike small a nd large quantity generators \nof hazardous waste, conditionally exempt generators are not required to notify the State of their regulated waste activity or to get an EPA identification number.  There is no time limit on how long they may store their \nhazardous waste on site as long as they don\u2019t exceed \nthe quantity limits for conditionally exempt small quantity generators, and they may transport their hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest under a standard bill of lading.   \n \nConditionally exempt genera tors may not dispose of \ntheir hazardous wastes on site or send them to a solid waste landfill in Colorado.  These wastes must be sent to a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal (TSD) facility, sent to a legitimate recycler of \nthe waste, or sent to an out-of-state solid waste \ndisposal facility that is permitted to accept conditionally exempt small quantity generator hazardous wastes.

Purpose\nThe purpose of this interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to establish and improve the working\nrelationship between the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor. The goals of the agencies are\nto improve the combined e\ufb00orts of the agencies to achieve protection of workers, the public, and the environment\nat facilities subject to EPA and OSHA jurisdiction; to delineate the general areas of responsibility of each agency;\nto provide guidelines for coordination of interface activities between the two agencies with the overall goal of\nidentifying and minimizing environmental or workplace hazards.\nThis MOU establishes a process and framework for noti\ufb01cation, consultation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA to aid both agencies in identifying environmental and workplace health and safety problems and to more\ne\ufb00ectively implement enforcement of our national workplace and environmental statutes.\nThis MOU is intended to improve the information exchange relating to job-site safety and health, protection of the\npublic health and environment thereby reducing the potential for workplace related injury, death, and\nenvironmental contamination. This MOU implements OSHA's authority under the Occupational Safety and Health\nAct of 1970 (OSH Act) and EPA's general and statute-speci\ufb01c authorities to enter into agreements with other\nfederal agencies to further the legislative objectives of Congress and the President.\nII. Background & Responsibilities\nEPA and OSHA have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and health of the public and America's\nworkforce through the timely and e\ufb00ective implementation of a number of federal laws and implementing\nregulations. In some areas, the responsibilities of the agencies are separate and distinct. In others, they are\ncomplementary. EPA and OSHA wish to work together to maximize the e\ufb00orts of both agencies to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment.\nA. EPA Responsibilities\nEPA responsibilities include the protection of public health and the environment by assuring compliance with\nfederal environmental statutes and regulations. Agency functions are performed through standards setting and\nrulemaking; technical reviews; audits and studies; conduct of public hearings; issuance of permits and licenses;\ncompliance inspections; investigations and enforcement; and evaluation of operating experience and research.\nB. OSHA Responsibilities\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 2/17OSHA is responsible for enforcing the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651 et. seq. The goal of the OSH Act is to assure so far\nas possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions. To achieve that\npurpose, the Act provides broad authority for a variety of activities and programs designed to reduce the number\nof occupational safety and health hazards at places of employment. Among these is the authority to promulgate\nmandatory safety and health standards for private sector workplaces, and to conduct inspections of such\nworkplaces to determine compliance with the Act and with OSHA standards. When violations are found, OSHA is\nauthorized to issue citations to employers, propose penalties, and require abatement of hazards. In cases\ninvolving imminent dangers, OSHA is authorized to seek injunctive relief in U.S. District Court. In states which\nhave elected to administer State occupational safety and health programs, or \"State plans,\" the Act requires\nOSHA to conduct a continuing evaluation of State operations and, in certain circumstances, to provide a program\nof concurrent federal OSHA enforcement.\nC. Applicable Statutes\nUnder the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651, every employer has a general duty, under section 5(a)(1), to furnish\nemployment and a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to\ncause, serious physical harm. Every employer is also required, under section 5(a)(2), to comply with occupational\nsafety and health standards promulgated by OSHA. In addition, employers must comply with regulations\nprescribed by OSHA under section 8 of the Act, which pertains to the conduct of workplace inspections among\nother things, and must furnish such records and other information as may be requested under section 24 of the\nAct.\nPrincipal EPA laws include but are not limited to:\nThe Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act:\n15 U.S.C. 2641; governing the removal of asbestos.\nThe Clean Air Act:\n42 U.S.C.

General Operating Procedures For Interagency Activity\nIn recognition of the agencies' statutory authorities and responsibilities enumerated above, the following\nprocedures will be followed:\nA. COORDINATION\n1. There will be the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and OSHA, at all organizational\nlevels, in developing and carrying out training, data and information exchange, technical and professional\nassistance, referrals of alleged violations, and related matters concerning compliance and law enforcement\nactivity to ensure the health and well-being of the Nation's workforce, the general public, and the environment.\n2. By January 1, 1991, and by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year, EPA and OSHA will develop an\nannual workplan to identify and de\ufb01ne the priorities to be addressed during the year. This workplan will include an\nidenti\ufb01cation of speci\ufb01c types of facilities to be jointly addressed during the year.\n3. EPA and OSHA will exchange names and phone numbers of appropriate agency headquarters, regional and\n\ufb01eld personnel, including personnel in OSHA area o\ufb03ces, and in state program o\ufb03ces. All information will be kept\nup to date by both agencies. Each EPA and OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will designate a point of contact for carrying\nout interface activities. Each agency agrees to prepare and distribute to all \ufb01eld personnel a suitable directive\noutlining a policy concerning the e\ufb00ective implementation of this MOU, and to identify appropriate points of\ncontact. In order to aid in the enforcement and issue-referral process, the agencies will update this information as\nthe need arises and will ensure that managers and \ufb01eld personnel are provided with a copy of this MOU and the\nrelevant directive.\n4. Resolution of interagency policy issues concerning this MOU and speci\ufb01c areas of implementation will be\ncoordinated between EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy. Resolution of issues\nconcerning inspection and enforcement activity involving both EPA and OSHA jurisdiction also will be coordinated\nby EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy.\nB. INSPECTIONS\n1. EPA and OSHA may conduct joint inspections as necessary to carry out the legislative purposes of the\nrespective statutory authorities. Such inspections may be in accordance with an annual workplan which is\ndeveloped by the two agencies and identi\ufb01es areas for joint initiatives. Such inspections may also be scheduled\non an ad hoc basis such as in investigations following accidents or fatalities or injuries to workers resulting from\nreported activities or situations subject to either EPA OR OSHA jurisdiction.\n2. EPA and OSHA inspectors, in the course of conducting separate inspections, may discover situations involving\npotential violations of the other agency's laws or regulations. In those instances, referrals to the appropriate o\ufb03ce\nwill be undertaken as described below.\nC. REFERRALS\n1. For law enforcement purposes, OSHA and EPA shall develop a regular system to track and manage referrals of\npotential violations, allegations of violations, or situations requiring inspection, evaluation or followup by either\nAgency, as appropriate.\n2. Although EPA does not conduct inspections for occupational safety, in the course of an EPA inspection, EPA\npersonnel may identify safety concerns within the area of OSHA responsibility or may receive complaints about\nthe safety or health of employees related to their working conditions. In such instances, EPA will bring the matter\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 4/17to the attention of OSHA designated contacts in the Regional O\ufb03ce. EPA inspectors are not to perform the role of\nOSHA inspectors; however, they will refer worker health and safety issues to OSHA pursuant to the procedures\nset forth in the MOU and implementing agency directives. In the case of worker complaints, EPA will disclose the\nname of individuals to OSHA but will not further disclose the name and the identity of the employee. When such\ninstances occur within OSHA State-plan States' jurisdiction, the OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will refer the matter to the\nState for appropriate action.\n3. OSHA will inform the EPA Regional Administrator or appropriate EPA o\ufb03ce of matters which appear to be\nsubject to EPA jurisdiction when these come to their attention during Federal or State safety and health\ninspections or through worker complaints. Although not exhaustive, the following are examples of matters that\nwould be reported to the EPA:\na. Worker allegations of signi\ufb01cant adverse reactions to a chemical or chemical substance which poses a\npotential hazard to public health or the environment.\nb. Accidental, unpermitted, or deliberate releases of chemicals or chemical substances beyond the workplace.\nc. Unsafe handling, storage, or use practices involving chemicals, chemical substances, or waste materials in\napparent violation of EPA-administered laws.\nd. Other readily detectible potential violations of EPA-administered laws, such as by-passing treatment systems.\ne. Asbestos dispersal or contamination a\ufb00ecting the public or the environment.\n4. EPA shall respond to referrals from OSHA, and OSHA shall respond to referrals from EPA, concerning potential\nviolations of the other agency's requirements, when appropriate, by conducting investigations in a timely manner.\nReferrals shall be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken.\n5. OSHA will work to facilitate referrals of potential violations of EPA regulations to EPA and will encourage the\nrelevant State agencies in those States which operate their own occupational safety and health programs (under a\nplan approved by OSHA under Section 18 of the OSH Act) also to make such referrals. EPA will work to facilitate\nreferrals to OSHA or OSHA State-plan States of potential violations of occupational health and safety standards\nor regulations discovered by federal or state environmental inspection activities.\n6. EPA and OSHA will conduct periodic meetings, as necessary, to report on the progress of actions taken on the\nother agency's referrals and to evaluate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the referral system and operating procedures. Both\nagencies agree to establish a system to monitor the progress of actions taken on referrals.\n7. OSHA will encourage State-plan States to respond to referrals from EPA and State agencies concerning\npotential violations of the States' occupational safety and health standards or regulations by conducting\ninvestigations in a timely manner. OSHA will further encourage State-plan States to participate in all training and\ninformation-sharing activities established under this MOU.\nD. DATA EXCHANGE\nEPA and OSHA agree to exchange information relating to complaints, inspections of investigations, violations\ndiscovered, imposition of civil monetary penalties, or other legal actions taken to enforce pertinent laws and\nregulations, and all other information necessary to ensure e\ufb00ective and coordinated law enforcement. This MOU\ncontemplates data exchange through both hard copy and computer data bases, in accordance with procedures\nto be established in a separate agreement.\nE. TRAINING\nEPA and OSHA will cooperate in developing and conducting periodic training programs for each other's\npersonnel in the respective laws, regulations, and compliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to\nensure that valid referrals are made when potential violations are found and to support joint enforcement and\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 5/17inspection initiatives. This MOU contemplates exchanges of appropriate training materials and information and\ndevelopment of specialized training activities in accordance with procedures to be established in a separate\nagreement.\nIV. Period of Agreement\nThis MOU shall continue in e\ufb00ect unless modi\ufb01ed in writing by mutual consent of both parties or terminated by\neither party upon 30 days advance written notice to the other.\nThis MOU does not preclude either Agency from entering into separate agreements setting forth procedures for\nother special programs which can be addressed more e\ufb03ciently and expeditiously by special agreement.\nV. Implementation\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to diminish or other-wise e\ufb00ect the authority of either agency to implement\nits respective statutory function. This Agreement is e\ufb00ective upon signature by both parties.\nFY 1991 WORKPLAN, AGREEMENT ON TRAINING \n& AGREEMENT ON DATA EXCHANGEU.S. Department of Labor\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n_______________________________\nGerard F.

OSHA-EPA Memorandum of Understanding\nThe Secretary of the Department of Labor and Administraton of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on November 23, 1990 with the goal of establishing a program\nfor improved environmental and workplace health and safety. Implementation of the program is to be coordinated\nprimarily by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and EPA O\ufb03ce of Enforcement. Although\nthe two agencies have worked cooperatively together in the past on a number of issues and investigation, no\ncomprehensive structure existed to focus that cooperative e\ufb00ort nationally. Having such a comprehensive\nstructure is particularly critical given the potential overlapping of EPA-OSHA responsibilities and the need to\nassure the most e\ufb00ective use of limited Federal resources.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding provides for coordination of the two agencies' general enforcement activities\nas well as joint inspections of facilities believed to be in violation of federal workplace or environmental standards;\nfacilities the exchange of technical information, computer data bases and other information to allow for better\ntargeting of inspections; and provides for cross-training programs.\nThe MOU requires that a number of speci\ufb01c actions be taken, including the development of a workplan for 1991\nwith subsequent annual workplans to be developed by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year. Separate\nagreements to implement training and data exchange have been developed to supplement this workplan.\n2. Speci\ufb01c Initiatives Identi\ufb01ed For Implementation in FY 1991\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 7/17Initial implementation will focus on two major initiatives beginning immediately. These are OSHA's petrochemical\n\"special emphasis\" inspection program (PetroSEP) and EPA's lead pollution reduction strategy. Although each\nproject was developed independently by each Agency, it is apparent that OSHA and EPA have a direct and\nindependent regulatory and enforcement interest in the successful combined implementation of these programs.\nPrior experience suggests that facilities with EPA violations have probable OSHA violations as well. In addition,\nbasic procedures for training and data exchange will be developed and implemented during FY 1991.\nA. OSHA Special Emphasis Program in Petrochemical Industries, Standard Industrial Classi\ufb01cation (SIC) Codes\n2821, 2869 and 2911; \"PetroSEP\"\nIncreased concern about petrochemical plant operations comes as the result of recent explosions in the chemical\nindustry. Explosions at the Phillips Houston Chemical Complex in Texas, ARCO in Channelview, Texas, and BASF\nCorporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, have left more than 40 workers dead. OSHA and EPA are committed to\nstrengthening e\ufb00orts in the chemical industry to prevent and mitigate the e\ufb00ects on workers, the public, and the\nenvironment of chemical accidents.\nThis workplan for the initial year of the MOU builds upon high priority enforcement initiatives already under way in\neach agency. OSHA has committed extensive compliance resources to a special emphasis inspection program in\n28 major petrochemical facilities, PetroSEP is designed to focus primarily on management systems governing the\nhealth and safety procedures for maintenance activities, contractor activities, and general operations including\ncompliance with regulations to control risk and prevent disaster.\nAreas for special review include the following standard industrial classi\ufb01cation (SIC):\n1. Plastic Materials; Synthetic Resins and Nonvulcanizable Elastomers; SIC Code: 2821\n2. Industrial Organic Chemicals; not elsewhere classi\ufb01ed; SIC Code 2869\n3. Petroleum Re\ufb01ning; SIC Code 2911\nThis review is limited to facilities in OSHA Regions II, III, V, and VI. EPA Regions II, III, V and VI correspond to\nOSHA regions for this initiative. EPA has designated contacts at the EPA Regional Division Director level to\ncoordinate joint inspection activity with OSHA. OSHA has prepared and distributed a Notice describing the\nPetroSEP program to a\ufb00ected OSHA regional o\ufb03ces. This notice includes applicable policy directives and\nprocedures to be followed in implementing the special emphasis program. EPA has distributed the OSHA Notice\nto EPA regional o\ufb03ces participating in the PetroSEP program.\nIn addition, EPA is providing OSHA with an inventory of the chemicals used in signi\ufb01cant quantities at each facility\nand data on accidental releases that have occurred. EPA will provide technical assistance when requested by\nOSHA during chemical process safety reviews. Further, in the coming months, EPA inspectors will join the OSHA\nteams in at least six of the OSHA-targeted facilities to conduct \"multi-media\" inspections -- that is, inspections\nwhich encompass the gamut of EPA-administered programs, including clean air, clean water, toxic substances,\nand hazardous waste.\nA major purpose of this inspection program is to identify and correct industry practices that are potential\ncontributing causes of accidental explosions. EPA also has a direct role and interest in this activity. Serious\naccidents not only represent an imminent threat to the health and safety of the plant's employees but also have a\npotential to release large quantities of toxic materials into the environment.\nAt this time, EPA has provided OSHA with all submitted toxics release inventory data for the 28 facilities that are\nsubject to the OSHA special inspection program. These data provide OSHA inspection teams with valuable\ninformation, such as a list of chemicals that are used in signi\ufb01cant quantities by each facility. EPA is also providing\nOSHA with information concerning accidental releases.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 8/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Target Identi\ufb01cation & Selection of 28 Facilities Done\nEPA Generation & Delivery of EPGRA Toxic Release Inventory ReportsDone\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Subset of Facilities For Federal Inspections Done\nJoint OSHA-EPA PetroSEP Regional Coordination Meeting April 4, 1991\nOSHA-EPA PetroSEP Conference Calls; generally every three weeks Ongoing; generally every three weeks\nEPA Inspection of Six Facilities To begin April 30, 1991\nTarget Date For Completion of PetroSEP September 1992\nB. Lead Pollution Reduction Strategy For Smelters, Incinerators and Hazardous Waste Sites.\nEPA has established an inter-agency workgroup, in which OSHA participates, to address the risks posed by\nexposure to lead. EPA has been coordinating its activities with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure\nthat lead reduction activities do not run at cross-purposes with the programs and goals of other agencies. The\nO\ufb03ce of Enforcement is supporting this Agency e\ufb00ort by ensuring that current regulatory standards are being met\nby lead-emitting facilities. OSHA is developing additional regulatory and enforcement approaches to reduce\nworker exposure to lead. OSHA has an existing permissible exposure limit (PEL) and worker protection\nrequirements that address lead exposures in general industry, and a PEL for lead exposure in the construction\nindustry. OSHA has also inspected and issued \"egregious\" penalty actions against nine lead smelters.\nOSHA has given top priority to updating its lead standard for the construction industry. This rulemaking has been\nput on a fast track, and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is expected in the current \ufb01scal year. At the same time,\nOSHA will be lowering the permissible exposure limit for lead in construction, as part of its update of its Air\nContaminants Standard for that industry. Until the new rule for the construction industry is in place, OSHA will\nissue a Hazard Information Bulletin for employers and workers in that industry, alerting them to the hazards of\nlead, particularly of lead-based paint removal operations, and suggesting work practices and personal protective\nequipment to minimize harmful exposures.\nEPA has briefed OSHA sta\ufb00 on EPA's Lead Pollution Reduction and Enforcement Strategies. While OSHA is\nunable to target these same facilities for full-scale inspections in FY 1991, OSHA will inform the EPA of reports of\naccidents or worker complaints which would trigger an OSHA inspection. In this way, EPA and OSHA may be able\nto undertake a limited amount of joint enforcement activity in these facilities this year. Finally, OSHA has provided\nEPA with \ufb01les of egregious cases resulting from inspections at four of the targeted smelters and the results of\nOSHA's FY 1990 inspections in general industry where there were cited violations of the lead standard associated\nwith overexposure.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nEPA Development of Lead Strategy Done\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Lead Smelter Enforcement Targets Done\nOSHA Submission of Lead Health Data Done\nOSHA Submission of Worker Complaints To EPA on Selected Target Facilities Ongoing\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 9/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Issuance of Lead Hazard Information Bulletin March 1991\nEPA Issuance of Enforcement Actions July 1991\nC.

EPA will establish a written\nsystem for tracking referrals of potential violations discovered and reported by OSHA personnel to ensure that\nthey are properly recorded, acknowledged, and followed-up on.\nAt a minimum, each system will include:\nA. a system for tracking reports;\nB. identi\ufb01cation of responsibilities and accountability;\nC. a process for at least quarterly review of the referrals to ensure that proper review has been given to each\nsigni\ufb01cant item.\nAction Needed Timetable\nDevelopment of Tracking Systems April 30, 1991\nImplementation of Tracking Systems June 30, 1991\nReview of Tracking Systems and Followup on Referrals September 30, 1991\nD. Development of Specialized Training For Inspectors and Case Development O\ufb03cers of Respective Agency\nStatutes and Programs\nDiscussions are underway concerning training for EPA and OSHA inspectors. To be e\ufb00ective \"eyes and ears\" for\neach other's respective programs, it is essential that OSHA \ufb01eld personnel and EPA \ufb01eld personnel clearly\nunderstand the most serious concerns of each other's statutory and regulatory authorities. To this end, the\nagencies have agreed to provide the following training programs:\na. For senior managers and policy planners. Each agency will present an overview of how each agency conducts\nits enforcement program, including a summary of statutory requirements, authorities and priority areas. It is\nanticipated that this specialized training will be o\ufb00ered annually. The training will also be available to OSHA State\nPlan Designees and Consultation Project Directors.\nb. For inspectors. During the \ufb01rst year of this MOU, the primary focus will be on developing basic materials for\nincorporation into each other's inspector training programs. EPA and OSHA will establish and present training to\naid in the identi\ufb01cation of workplace or environmental hazards for the purpose of making referrals. Such training\nwill focus on providing a general understanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction and\nthe process for notifying, through a complaint and referral system, the other agency when potential violations\ncome to the inspectors attention. Special emphasis will be made on identifying cases or situations that suggest\napparent hazards which could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to workers, the public or environment, requiring prompt\nremediation.\nAction Needed Timetable\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 10/17Action Needed Timetable\nExchange of Existing EPA & OSHA Training Calendars Done\nTraining Developed For Senior Managers February 28, 1991\nDevelopment of Training Materials September 30, 1991\nE. Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring Data Exchange Program\nEach agency will identify key personnel to establish a Data Exchange Committee (DEC). The DEC will have overall\nresponsibility for implementing the data exchange section of the MOU. Data may be requested for general\ntargeting purposes, determining compliance histories or background information on speci\ufb01c facilities, industrial\nsegments or categories or related reasons. The exchange of Agency computer data bases on chemical\nmanagement, permits and compliance is a major focus of this workplan and the supplemental Agreement on Data\nExchange.\nThe initial task will be to identify the client community within each agency and the type of data of interest. The\nDEC will identify data managers and their systems to help identify speci\ufb01c data of interest. The DEC will facilitate\nunderstanding of each agency's data and data systems by exchanging data and system descriptions and by\nproviding presentations about data and data systems. Each Agency agrees to provide materials and assistance in\norder to understand the other agency's data.\nThe DEC will develop a framework within their respective client communities to identify and implement the most\ne\ufb03cient methodology to exchange data. This framework may include but is not limited to the exchange of\nhardcopy data reports, or exchange through electronic means and direct database access. Each agency agrees\nto provide training, when required, to directly access identi\ufb01ed databases.\nThe DEC will identify key individuals in each agency that will initiate, receive and coordinate data requests. These\nindividuals will be responsible for the data exchange. The DEC will agree on a process for each agency to follow\nwhen requesting data form the other agency.\nAction Needed Timetable\nIdentify OSHA & EPA Personnel for Data Exchange Committee February 28, 1991\nDEC identi\ufb01es client o\ufb03ces & data needs March 30, 1991\nDevelop framework to identify methods for e\ufb00ective data exchange April 30, 1991\nEstablish process for data exchange April 30, 1991\n3. Planning Activities for FY 1992\nThe main intent of the \ufb01rst annual workplan is to identify major enforcement initiatives that can readily be\nsupported by each agency. It is anticipated that information gathered in the course of implementing PetroSEP and\nthe Lead Initiative will generate a number of ideas and initiative areas for FY 1992. Understanding the\nfundamentals of how each agency operates and the extent of statutory duties and policy initiatives will allow the\nagencies to better target and implement initiatives for FY 1992.\nA planning meeting will be held during the \ufb01rst two weeks of June at which representatives of each Agency will\nrecommend areas for concentration based upon experiences in the \ufb01rst half of FY 1991. Areas of focus will\ninclude initiatives, training opportunities and needs, and improved use of data bases. A \ufb01nal workplan will be\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 11/17developed by October 1, 1991.\nAction Needed Timetable\nEach agency identi\ufb01es initial target areas for enforcement investigations in FY 1992 April 30, 1991\nCommunicate priority areas to regional/\ufb01eld o\ufb03ces for review/comment April 30, 1991\nOSHA-EPA meeting to discuss potential joint initiatives June 30, 1991\nFinalize MOU Workplan based on agency workplans July 30, 1991\nDevelop press strategy to highlight achievements in FY 1991 and to anounce goals for\nFY 1992September 30,\n1991\n4.

Background\nOn November 23, 1990, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) of the United States Department of Labor and the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. The Purpose of this MOU is to improve the working relationship\nbetween the agencies in the enforcement of their respective statutes and to maximize their e\ufb00orts to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment at facilities subject to EPA and OSHA\njurisdiction. The MOU provides for additional agreements to carry out training and data exchange between the\nagencies. This document establishes the terms of an Agreement on Training (Agreement) to support OSHA and\nEPA enforcement activities.\nII. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to provide the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA in developing and carrying out training in support of the MOU. OSHA and EPA will cooperate in developing\nand conducting periodic training programs for each other's personnel in the respective laws, regulations, and\ncompliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to ensure that valid referrals are made when potential\nviolations are found, and to support joint enforcement and inspection initiatives.\nIII. Target Group\nThe target group for this Agreement includes all present and future EPA and OSHA inspectors, who investigate\nworkplaces where hazards regulated by either OSHA, or EPA are likely to exist, and other appropriate personnel.\nIV. Training Focus\nEPA will support training of OSHA inspectors in recognizing environmental hazards for the purpose of making\nreferrals. Conversely, OSHA will support training of EPA inspectors in identifying workplace hazards so that they\ncan make referrals. Therefore, training of EPA and OSHA inspectors will focus on providing a general\nunderstanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction, signi\ufb01cant hazards regulated by the\nother agency, especially those requiring immediate remediation, and the procedures for notifying o\ufb03cials when\npotential violations come to the inspector's attention. After receiving instruction in the appropriate EPA and OSHA\nregulations, OSHA and EPA inspectors will be able to recognize and refer to the respective authorities those\ncases where apparent hazards could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to the workplace, public, or environment.\nV. Implementation\nA. Basic Training OSHA and EPA inspectors will receive training in the basic concepts of recognizing, evaluating,\nand controlling occupational and environmental hazards commonly found in the workplace. Each agency will\ndevelop appropriate materials on these matters for inclusion in the other agency's training program. The materials\nmay be based on training materials which already are part of each agency's inspector training program and will\nconsist of written materials as well as audio-visual modules. After both agencies have developed training\nmaterials, the materials will be exchanged and then delivered, as soon as possible, to present EPA and OSHA\ninspectors. The training materials will also be included in the basic inspector training programs required to be\ntaken by all new OSHA and EPA inspectors.\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 13/17B. Specialized Training\n1. Cross Training When appropriate and to the extent possible, EPA and OSHA will provide for attendance at\nexisting agency training courses for inspectors of the other agency.\n2. Joint Training As OSHA and EPA identify joint enforcement and inspection initiatives under the Annual Workplan\ncalled for in the MOU, EPA and OSHA will develop training materials and as appropriate conduct joint training for\nthe inspectors who will be carrying out those initiatives.\n3. Location Specialized training will be conducted at, but is not limited to, EPA's National Enforcement Training\nInstitute, EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center, and the OSHA Training Institute.\nC. Coordination\nOSHA's responsibilities under the Agreement will be coordinated by the Director, OSHA Training Institute. EPA's\nresponsibilities under the Agreement will be coordinated by the Chief of the Program Development and Training\nBranch of the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement.\nVI.

The purpose of this MOU is to improve the working\nrelationship between the agencies in the enforcement of their respective statutes and to maximize their e\ufb00orts to\nensure the e\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment at facilities subject to EPA\nand OSHA jurisdiction. The MOU provides for additional agreements to carry out training and data exchange\nbetween the agencies. This document establishes the terms of an Agreement on Data Exchange (Agreement) to\nsupport OSHA and EPA enforcement activities.\nII. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to establish the foundation of a data exchange program between EPA and\nOSHA that will be mutually bene\ufb01cial to each Agency as it discharges its respective responsibilities.\nIII. Implementation\nEach agency will identify key personnel to establish a Data Exchange Committee (DEC). The DEC will have overall\nresponsibility for implementing the data exchange section of the MOU. The DEC will identify key individuals in\neach Agency who will initiate, receive and coordinate data requests, including key OSHA personnel who will be\nresponsible for notifying OSHA State Plan States when their data is provided to EPA.\nThe initial task for each agency is the identi\ufb01cation of the client community within OSHA and EPA. This includes\nidentifying and describing mutually bene\ufb01cial data. The DEC will identify data managers and their systems in each\nagency to help describe speci\ufb01c data of interest. The DEC will facilitate the understanding of each Agency's data\nand systems by exchanging data and system descriptions and providing presentations about the data and\nsystems.

        "text": " \nPage 1 of 4  \nCompliance Bulletin \nHazardous Waste  \nManagement of Waste Aerosol Cans  \nreviewed/revised August 2002 \nWhich aerosol cans are regulated as hazardous \nwaste?  \nAerosol cans sometimes need to be discarded before they are completely empty.  This occurs for a variety of reasons, including when the spray mechanism no \nlonger operates as designed, the propellant is spent, or \nthe product is no longer used.  In these cases it must be determined whether the contents\n remaining in the can \nare hazardous waste, either by exhibiting a characteristic  of hazardous waste (such as ignitability \n(D001)) or  because they are a  listed waste (such as \ntrichloroethylene (U228)) [Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 261].  It is important to remember that the contents remaining in an aerosol can would not be considered spent and therefore could not carry the F-codes for spent solvents.  An aerosol can \nmay, however, carry a P- or U-code for unused \nchemical products.    While residential consumers are exempt from the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations, businesses, \nschools and government facilities that generate \nhazardous wastes must follow these requirements regarding proper management and disposal of hazardous wastes applicable for their generator category.  Generators of waste aerosol cans are responsible for determining if their wastes are \nhazardous.  If the contents of the aerosol cans are \nhazardous, they must be managed in compliance with the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations [6 CCR 1007-3].    Which aerosol cans are not\n regulated as hazardous \nwaste? \n \nAerosol cans that are still in use or that contain useable \nproduct are not yet considered wastes.  Aerosol cans that are empty or that contain materials that are not \nconsidered hazardous wastes may be managed as solid \nwaste.  \nHow should aerosol cans determined to contain \nhazardous waste be managed? \n \nIn the past, if an aerosol can contained a hazardous waste, it needed to be managed in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, \ntraining and manifesting requirements, as well as restrictive time limits. The Colorado Hazardous Waste \nCommission has adopted reduced management prac-\ntices for aerosol cans containing hazardous waste under the Universal Waste Rule.  Therefore, someone who generates aerosol cans containing hazardous waste may choose to manage these cans in full compliance with \nParts 260 through 268, Parts 99 and 100 of the Colo-\nrado Hazardous Waste Regulations, or with the re-duced requirements of Part 273, Universal Waste Rule. \n \nWhat are Universal Wastes? \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule [6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273] includes certain hazardous wastes that are commonly generated by very small to very large non-residential \nsources such as businesses, government agencies, and \nschools.  Universal wastes are subject to wide-spread \nuse, which makes disposal of these hazardous wastes difficult to control.     \n \n     \n \n Materials included as universal wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and have been required to be handled as \nhazardous wastes since the early 1980s.  In the past, if \nthese wastes were determined to be a hazardous waste, small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste needed to manage them in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, employee training, manifest requirements, and \nrestrictive time limits. [6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 260 - 268, \n99, 100]   \n \nWhy manage waste aerosol ca ns as universal waste?  \n \nManaging aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as \nuniversal wastes is most beneficial to small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste, or conditionally exempt small quantity generators that \nwould otherwise be small qua ntity generators if they \ndid not manage some of their wastes as universal \nUniversal Wastes include many: \n\uf0b7 batteries \n\uf0b7 pesticides \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing devices \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing lighting wastes \n\uf0b7 aerosol cans  \n\uf0b7 electronic devices and components \n \nPage 2 of 4 wastes.   The primary benef its of choosing the reduced \nmanagement standards of the universal waste rule are that the waste does not count toward the monthly total \nof hazardous waste in determining generator category; \nthe waste can be shipped in Colorado without a hazardous waste manifest; the waste can be shipped by common carrier instead of a hazardous waste transporter; there are reduced notification and record-keeping requirements, and the storage time limits are \nless restrictive.    \n Since universal waste does not require a hazardous waste manifest for shipment in Colorado, it is not considered hazardous waste under US Department of \nTransportation regulations.  Other states may have \nmore stringent requirements for these wastes, however, and may require use of the hazardous waste manifest.  State requirements for universal waste transporters are \nincluded in 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273 Subpart D.   \n \nWhat are the requirements for universal waste \nmanagement? \n \nCategories of Universal Waste Handlers  \n \nUnder the Universal Waste Rule, persons who generate or accumulate aerosol cans containing hazardous waste are considered \u201chandlers\u201d of universal waste. [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  [Note: this definition is different from that of a generator  of hazardous waste]. \n \nThere are two categories of handlers, Small Quantity \nHandlers of Universal Waste and Large Quantity Handlers of Universal Waste.  A small quantity handler of universal waste is one who does not accumulate more than 5,000 kilograms of universal at any one \ntime.  A large quantity handler of universal waste is a \nhandler of universal waste who accumulates 5,000 kilograms or more of universal waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  The designation of small quantity or large quantity handler of universal waste has no \nrelationship to a facility\u2019s hazardous waste generator  \nstatus.  Thus a small quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a large quantity handler of universal waste, and a facility that is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a small quantity handler of universal waste. \n \nIf, at any time during the calendar year, a facility ex-ceeds the quantities for a small quantity handler of universal waste, they woul d be considered a large \nquantity handler until the next calendar year when they \ncan reevaluate their status.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.9] Notification  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are not required to notify the Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division (the Division) of their universal \nwaste management activities.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.12]  Large quantity handlers of universal waste are required to notify the Division of their universal waste management activities and obtain an EPA identification number using EPA Form 8700-12.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.32]  This must be done even \nif the facility has previously given notification and \nreceived an EPA identification number for its hazardous waste activities.  The EPA identification number will remain the same.    \nAccumulation of Waste  \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule was designed to streamline \nthe regulatory process and encourage recycling.  \nTherefore, a handler of universal waste cannot dispose of the waste without a permit and treatment is not allowed except under certain specified conditions in Part 273 of the Colorado h azardous waste regulations \n[6 CCR 1007-3].  All handlers of universal waste are \nrequired to manage their waste in a manner that prevents releases of the waste or waste constituents.  There is a one year accumulation time limit, and handlers must be able to demonstrate that universal \nwaste on site has not been accumulated for more than \none year.  Although it is not required to be marked with the accumulation start date, this would be the easiest way to document that the waste is in compliance with the one year accumulation limit.  \nLabeling  \n \nWhen a universal waste aerosol can is generated, it must either be labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Can\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Can,\u201d or be put into an accumulation container labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Cans\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Cans.\u201d  If the \naerosol can is placed into an accumulation container, \nonly the accumulation container needs to be labeled as containing waste aerosol cans, not the individual cans within it.  If the individual aerosol can is not in good condition and is leaking or shows signs that it could leak, it must be individually over packed in a container \nthat is labeled.  If the accu mulation container is not in \ngood condition, it must be over packed or the cans must be removed and put into a container that is in good condition.  \n \nPage 3 of 4 Shipment of Waste  \n \nA universal waste handler cannot dispose of universal \nwaste on site without a permit, and treatment by the handler is not allowed exce pt under limited conditions \n(see the section on handler treatment). Universal waste \ncan only be shipped to another universal waste handler, a destination facility or a foreign destination.  Ship-ment to another universal waste handler is allowed to aid in consolidation of wastes.  A destination facility is a facility that is permitted to treat, dispose, or recycle \nthe waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9] \nShipment of universal waste in Colorado does not require the use of the hazardous waste manifest system.  Therefore, universal waste is not considered hazardous waste under US DOT regulations.  Some universal \nwastes are regulated by the US DOT as hazardous \nmaterials because they meet criteria for one or more hazard classes, but the word \"waste\" may not be used in the shipping name.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.52]   \nOther states may have different requirements for \nwastes that are managed as universal waste in \nColorado.  The handler should always confirm the regulatory status of universal wastes in the destination state and all intervening states the waste will travel through. \n \nEmployee Training  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are required \nto inform all employees who manage universal waste about the proper handling and emergency procedures appropriate to the types of universal waste at the facility.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.16] Large \nquantity handlers of universal waste are required to \nensure that personnel are thoroughly familiar with the requirements for universal waste management and emergency response relative to their level of responsibilities in dealing with the waste.  [6 CCR \n1007-3 Section 273.36] \n \nHandlers of waste aerosol cans who puncture aerosol \ncans are required to ensure that personnel thoroughly understand how to safely operate the puncturing device, as well as how to safely manage the waste \ngenerated from the puncturing operation. \n \nSpills  \n \nAll handlers of universal waste are required to \nimmediately containerize and appropriately manage any spills or residues from releases of universal wastes.  \n[6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(a), 273.37(a)]  The \nwaste generated from a release of universal waste would be considered newly generated waste, and a \nhazardous waste determination would need to be made.  If it is determined that any or all of the released \nmaterial or residue is hazardous, it must be managed in \naccordance with the hazardous waste regulations and not the universal waste requirements.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(b), 273.37(b)]  The handler of the universal waste at the time of the release would be the generator of the newly generated hazardous waste and \nmust adhere to all applicable requirements of the \nColorado hazardous waste regulations.    \nRecord Keeping Requirements  \n \nA small quantity handler of universal waste is not required to maintain records.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.19]  However, it is strongly advisable to keep \nadequate records to document waste management practices and substantiate the facility\u2019s universal waste handler status.    A large quantity handler of universal waste must keep \nwritten records for universal wastes shipped to and \nfrom its facilities.  These records must be kept for at least three years and include:  the types and quantities of universal waste shipped or received, the date the waste was shipped or received, and to whom the waste \nwas shipped.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.39]  There is \nno requirement to maintain formal training records for either category.  Transporters of universal waste are required to keep records in accordance with US DOT requirements.  A \ndestination facility is subject to all applicable \nrequirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 264-268, 99 & 100.  If the destination facility recycles the universal waste without storing it, they need only notify the Department of their activity under 6 CCR 1007-3 Part \n99 and keep records of each shipment.  If the \ndestination facility is a Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF), they are required to keep records in accordance with their hazardous waste permit.  Can a universal waste handler treat its hazardous wastes? \n \nUniversal waste handlers can\u2019t dispose of universal wastes without a permit and treatment by the handler is not allowed except under limited conditions. \n \nPuncturing waste aerosol cans  \n \nPuncturing of waste aerosol cans is allowed by \nuniversal waste handlers as long as it is conducted in accordance with the requirements of Part 273.13 or \n \nPage 4 of 4 273.33 of the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations.  \nPrior to puncturing waste aerosol cans, the handler must develop and implement a written procedure \ndetailing how to puncture the cans safely.  Included in \nthis document must be the type of equipment to be used, operation and maintenance of the equipment and the precautions that need to be taken to protect the worker.  In addition, the document must include a review of the wastes that will be generated from the \npuncturing activities and an outline of how \nincompatible wastes will be  segregated prior to and \nafter puncturing.  Special management procedures necessary to manage the waste properly, such as ensuring that flammable wastes are stored away from \nheat or open flames, also need to be evaluated prior to \npuncturing.  Additionally, this procedure must detail the frequency of filter change out, if applicable. [Note: it may be necessary to file an Air Pollution Emission Notice (APEN) for the puncturing operation and to use \ncontrol devices to capture air borne contamination.]  A \nspill kit must be readily av ailable in case wastes are \nspilled during the puncturing activities.  Once the puncturing activity occurs, the contents from the can or the puncturing device must be transferred to \na container meeting the requirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 \nSection 262.34.  At the point the material is removed from the can, it is considered a hazardous waste and must be managed in accordance with all hazardous waste regulations.  It can no longer be managed as \nuniversal waste.  The quantity of waste generated from \nthe punctured cans must be included in the determina-tion of generator status.  All applicable generator \nrequirements contained in Part 262 apply to this newly generated waste including accumulation time limits.   \nOnce the waste aerosol cans have been emptied, they \ncan be managed as a RCRA empty container and either recycled as scrap metal or disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations.  What about Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG)? \n \nConditionally exempt small quantity generators are \nthose that generate less than 100 kilograms \n(approximately 25 gallons or 250 pounds) of total \nhazardous waste and no more than one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste per calendar month AND never accumulate more th an 1000 kilograms of \nhazardous waste on site at one time.  In Colorado, \nconditionally exempt generators are not excused from \nidentifying which of their wastes are hazardous wastes and must ensure that their wastes are sent to a facility that is permitted to accept it.   Conditionally exempt small quantity generators may \nchoose to manage their aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as conditionally exempt wastes or as \nuniversal wastes. [ 6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.8 ]  \nBecause of the reduced management requirements already applicable to c onditionally exempt small \nquantity generators of hazar dous waste, it is generally \nnot to their benefit to manage their wastes as universal waste, unless they would ot herwise be small quantity \ngenerators.  Unlike small a nd large quantity generators \nof hazardous waste, conditionally exempt generators are not required to notify the State of their regulated waste activity or to get an EPA identification number.  There is no time limit on how long they may store their \nhazardous waste on site as long as they don\u2019t exceed \nthe quantity limits for conditionally exempt small quantity generators, and they may transport their hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest under a standard bill of lading.   \n \nConditionally exempt genera tors may not dispose of \ntheir hazardous wastes on site or send them to a solid waste landfill in Colorado.  These wastes must be sent to a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal (TSD) facility, sent to a legitimate recycler of \nthe waste, or sent to an out-of-state solid waste \ndisposal facility that is permitted to accept conditionally exempt small quantity generator hazardous wastes.

Purpose\nThe purpose of this interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to establish and improve the working\nrelationship between the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor. The goals of the agencies are\nto improve the combined e\ufb00orts of the agencies to achieve protection of workers, the public, and the environment\nat facilities subject to EPA and OSHA jurisdiction; to delineate the general areas of responsibility of each agency;\nto provide guidelines for coordination of interface activities between the two agencies with the overall goal of\nidentifying and minimizing environmental or workplace hazards.\nThis MOU establishes a process and framework for noti\ufb01cation, consultation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA to aid both agencies in identifying environmental and workplace health and safety problems and to more\ne\ufb00ectively implement enforcement of our national workplace and environmental statutes.\nThis MOU is intended to improve the information exchange relating to job-site safety and health, protection of the\npublic health and environment thereby reducing the potential for workplace related injury, death, and\nenvironmental contamination. This MOU implements OSHA's authority under the Occupational Safety and Health\nAct of 1970 (OSH Act) and EPA's general and statute-speci\ufb01c authorities to enter into agreements with other\nfederal agencies to further the legislative objectives of Congress and the President.\nII. Background & Responsibilities\nEPA and OSHA have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and health of the public and America's\nworkforce through the timely and e\ufb00ective implementation of a number of federal laws and implementing\nregulations. In some areas, the responsibilities of the agencies are separate and distinct. In others, they are\ncomplementary. EPA and OSHA wish to work together to maximize the e\ufb00orts of both agencies to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment.\nA. EPA Responsibilities\nEPA responsibilities include the protection of public health and the environment by assuring compliance with\nfederal environmental statutes and regulations. Agency functions are performed through standards setting and\nrulemaking; technical reviews; audits and studies; conduct of public hearings; issuance of permits and licenses;\ncompliance inspections; investigations and enforcement; and evaluation of operating experience and research.\nB. OSHA Responsibilities\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 2/17OSHA is responsible for enforcing the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651 et. seq. The goal of the OSH Act is to assure so far\nas possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions. To achieve that\npurpose, the Act provides broad authority for a variety of activities and programs designed to reduce the number\nof occupational safety and health hazards at places of employment. Among these is the authority to promulgate\nmandatory safety and health standards for private sector workplaces, and to conduct inspections of such\nworkplaces to determine compliance with the Act and with OSHA standards. When violations are found, OSHA is\nauthorized to issue citations to employers, propose penalties, and require abatement of hazards. In cases\ninvolving imminent dangers, OSHA is authorized to seek injunctive relief in U.S. District Court. In states which\nhave elected to administer State occupational safety and health programs, or \"State plans,\" the Act requires\nOSHA to conduct a continuing evaluation of State operations and, in certain circumstances, to provide a program\nof concurrent federal OSHA enforcement.\nC. Applicable Statutes\nUnder the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651, every employer has a general duty, under section 5(a)(1), to furnish\nemployment and a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to\ncause, serious physical harm. Every employer is also required, under section 5(a)(2), to comply with occupational\nsafety and health standards promulgated by OSHA. In addition, employers must comply with regulations\nprescribed by OSHA under section 8 of the Act, which pertains to the conduct of workplace inspections among\nother things, and must furnish such records and other information as may be requested under section 24 of the\nAct.\nPrincipal EPA laws include but are not limited to:\nThe Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act:\n15 U.S.C. 2641; governing the removal of asbestos.\nThe Clean Air Act:\n42 U.S.C. Sections 7401 to 7642; governing the release of air pollutants.\nThe Clean Water Act:\n33 U.S.C. 1251 to 1387; governing the pre-treatment and release of pollutants to water.\nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act:\n42 U.S.C.

General Operating Procedures For Interagency Activity\nIn recognition of the agencies' statutory authorities and responsibilities enumerated above, the following\nprocedures will be followed:\nA. COORDINATION\n1. There will be the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and OSHA, at all organizational\nlevels, in developing and carrying out training, data and information exchange, technical and professional\nassistance, referrals of alleged violations, and related matters concerning compliance and law enforcement\nactivity to ensure the health and well-being of the Nation's workforce, the general public, and the environment.\n2. By January 1, 1991, and by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year, EPA and OSHA will develop an\nannual workplan to identify and de\ufb01ne the priorities to be addressed during the year. This workplan will include an\nidenti\ufb01cation of speci\ufb01c types of facilities to be jointly addressed during the year.\n3. EPA and OSHA will exchange names and phone numbers of appropriate agency headquarters, regional and\n\ufb01eld personnel, including personnel in OSHA area o\ufb03ces, and in state program o\ufb03ces. All information will be kept\nup to date by both agencies. Each EPA and OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will designate a point of contact for carrying\nout interface activities. Each agency agrees to prepare and distribute to all \ufb01eld personnel a suitable directive\noutlining a policy concerning the e\ufb00ective implementation of this MOU, and to identify appropriate points of\ncontact. In order to aid in the enforcement and issue-referral process, the agencies will update this information as\nthe need arises and will ensure that managers and \ufb01eld personnel are provided with a copy of this MOU and the\nrelevant directive.\n4. Resolution of interagency policy issues concerning this MOU and speci\ufb01c areas of implementation will be\ncoordinated between EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy. Resolution of issues\nconcerning inspection and enforcement activity involving both EPA and OSHA jurisdiction also will be coordinated\nby EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy.\nB. INSPECTIONS\n1. EPA and OSHA may conduct joint inspections as necessary to carry out the legislative purposes of the\nrespective statutory authorities. Such inspections may be in accordance with an annual workplan which is\ndeveloped by the two agencies and identi\ufb01es areas for joint initiatives. Such inspections may also be scheduled\non an ad hoc basis such as in investigations following accidents or fatalities or injuries to workers resulting from\nreported activities or situations subject to either EPA OR OSHA jurisdiction.\n2. EPA and OSHA inspectors, in the course of conducting separate inspections, may discover situations involving\npotential violations of the other agency's laws or regulations. In those instances, referrals to the appropriate o\ufb03ce\nwill be undertaken as described below.\nC. REFERRALS\n1. For law enforcement purposes, OSHA and EPA shall develop a regular system to track and manage referrals of\npotential violations, allegations of violations, or situations requiring inspection, evaluation or followup by either\nAgency, as appropriate.\n2. Although EPA does not conduct inspections for occupational safety, in the course of an EPA inspection, EPA\npersonnel may identify safety concerns within the area of OSHA responsibility or may receive complaints about\nthe safety or health of employees related to their working conditions. In such instances, EPA will bring the matter\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 4/17to the attention of OSHA designated contacts in the Regional O\ufb03ce. EPA inspectors are not to perform the role of\nOSHA inspectors; however, they will refer worker health and safety issues to OSHA pursuant to the procedures\nset forth in the MOU and implementing agency directives. In the case of worker complaints, EPA will disclose the\nname of individuals to OSHA but will not further disclose the name and the identity of the employee. When such\ninstances occur within OSHA State-plan States' jurisdiction, the OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will refer the matter to the\nState for appropriate action.\n3. OSHA will inform the EPA Regional Administrator or appropriate EPA o\ufb03ce of matters which appear to be\nsubject to EPA jurisdiction when these come to their attention during Federal or State safety and health\ninspections or through worker complaints. Although not exhaustive, the following are examples of matters that\nwould be reported to the EPA:\na. Worker allegations of signi\ufb01cant adverse reactions to a chemical or chemical substance which poses a\npotential hazard to public health or the environment.\nb. Accidental, unpermitted, or deliberate releases of chemicals or chemical substances beyond the workplace.\nc. Unsafe handling, storage, or use practices involving chemicals, chemical substances, or waste materials in\napparent violation of EPA-administered laws.\nd. Other readily detectible potential violations of EPA-administered laws, such as by-passing treatment systems.\ne. Asbestos dispersal or contamination a\ufb00ecting the public or the environment.\n4. EPA shall respond to referrals from OSHA, and OSHA shall respond to referrals from EPA, concerning potential\nviolations of the other agency's requirements, when appropriate, by conducting investigations in a timely manner.\nReferrals shall be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken.\n5. OSHA will work to facilitate referrals of potential violations of EPA regulations to EPA and will encourage the\nrelevant State agencies in those States which operate their own occupational safety and health programs (under a\nplan approved by OSHA under Section 18 of the OSH Act) also to make such referrals. EPA will work to facilitate\nreferrals to OSHA or OSHA State-plan States of potential violations of occupational health and safety standards\nor regulations discovered by federal or state environmental inspection activities.\n6. EPA and OSHA will conduct periodic meetings, as necessary, to report on the progress of actions taken on the\nother agency's referrals and to evaluate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the referral system and operating procedures. Both\nagencies agree to establish a system to monitor the progress of actions taken on referrals.\n7. OSHA will encourage State-plan States to respond to referrals from EPA and State agencies concerning\npotential violations of the States' occupational safety and health standards or regulations by conducting\ninvestigations in a timely manner. OSHA will further encourage State-plan States to participate in all training and\ninformation-sharing activities established under this MOU.\nD. DATA EXCHANGE\nEPA and OSHA agree to exchange information relating to complaints, inspections of investigations, violations\ndiscovered, imposition of civil monetary penalties, or other legal actions taken to enforce pertinent laws and\nregulations, and all other information necessary to ensure e\ufb00ective and coordinated law enforcement. This MOU\ncontemplates data exchange through both hard copy and computer data bases, in accordance with procedures\nto be established in a separate agreement.\nE. TRAINING\nEPA and OSHA will cooperate in developing and conducting periodic training programs for each other's\npersonnel in the respective laws, regulations, and compliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to\nensure that valid referrals are made when potential violations are found and to support joint enforcement and\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 5/17inspection initiatives. This MOU contemplates exchanges of appropriate training materials and information and\ndevelopment of specialized training activities in accordance with procedures to be established in a separate\nagreement.\nIV. Period of Agreement\nThis MOU shall continue in e\ufb00ect unless modi\ufb01ed in writing by mutual consent of both parties or terminated by\neither party upon 30 days advance written notice to the other.\nThis MOU does not preclude either Agency from entering into separate agreements setting forth procedures for\nother special programs which can be addressed more e\ufb03ciently and expeditiously by special agreement.\nV. Implementation\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to diminish or other-wise e\ufb00ect the authority of either agency to implement\nits respective statutory function. This Agreement is e\ufb00ective upon signature by both parties.\nFY 1991 WORKPLAN, AGREEMENT ON TRAINING \n& AGREEMENT ON DATA EXCHANGEU.S. Department of Labor\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n_______________________________\nGerard F.

OSHA-EPA Memorandum of Understanding\nThe Secretary of the Department of Labor and Administraton of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on November 23, 1990 with the goal of establishing a program\nfor improved environmental and workplace health and safety. Implementation of the program is to be coordinated\nprimarily by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and EPA O\ufb03ce of Enforcement. Although\nthe two agencies have worked cooperatively together in the past on a number of issues and investigation, no\ncomprehensive structure existed to focus that cooperative e\ufb00ort nationally. Having such a comprehensive\nstructure is particularly critical given the potential overlapping of EPA-OSHA responsibilities and the need to\nassure the most e\ufb00ective use of limited Federal resources.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding provides for coordination of the two agencies' general enforcement activities\nas well as joint inspections of facilities believed to be in violation of federal workplace or environmental standards;\nfacilities the exchange of technical information, computer data bases and other information to allow for better\ntargeting of inspections; and provides for cross-training programs.\nThe MOU requires that a number of speci\ufb01c actions be taken, including the development of a workplan for 1991\nwith subsequent annual workplans to be developed by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year. Separate\nagreements to implement training and data exchange have been developed to supplement this workplan.\n2. Speci\ufb01c Initiatives Identi\ufb01ed For Implementation in FY 1991\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 7/17Initial implementation will focus on two major initiatives beginning immediately. These are OSHA's petrochemical\n\"special emphasis\" inspection program (PetroSEP) and EPA's lead pollution reduction strategy. Although each\nproject was developed independently by each Agency, it is apparent that OSHA and EPA have a direct and\nindependent regulatory and enforcement interest in the successful combined implementation of these programs.\nPrior experience suggests that facilities with EPA violations have probable OSHA violations as well. In addition,\nbasic procedures for training and data exchange will be developed and implemented during FY 1991.\nA. OSHA Special Emphasis Program in Petrochemical Industries, Standard Industrial Classi\ufb01cation (SIC) Codes\n2821, 2869 and 2911; \"PetroSEP\"\nIncreased concern about petrochemical plant operations comes as the result of recent explosions in the chemical\nindustry. Explosions at the Phillips Houston Chemical Complex in Texas, ARCO in Channelview, Texas, and BASF\nCorporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, have left more than 40 workers dead. OSHA and EPA are committed to\nstrengthening e\ufb00orts in the chemical industry to prevent and mitigate the e\ufb00ects on workers, the public, and the\nenvironment of chemical accidents.\nThis workplan for the initial year of the MOU builds upon high priority enforcement initiatives already under way in\neach agency. OSHA has committed extensive compliance resources to a special emphasis inspection program in\n28 major petrochemical facilities, PetroSEP is designed to focus primarily on management systems governing the\nhealth and safety procedures for maintenance activities, contractor activities, and general operations including\ncompliance with regulations to control risk and prevent disaster.\nAreas for special review include the following standard industrial classi\ufb01cation (SIC):\n1. Plastic Materials; Synthetic Resins and Nonvulcanizable Elastomers; SIC Code: 2821\n2. Industrial Organic Chemicals; not elsewhere classi\ufb01ed; SIC Code 2869\n3. Petroleum Re\ufb01ning; SIC Code 2911\nThis review is limited to facilities in OSHA Regions II, III, V, and VI. EPA Regions II, III, V and VI correspond to\nOSHA regions for this initiative. EPA has designated contacts at the EPA Regional Division Director level to\ncoordinate joint inspection activity with OSHA. OSHA has prepared and distributed a Notice describing the\nPetroSEP program to a\ufb00ected OSHA regional o\ufb03ces. This notice includes applicable policy directives and\nprocedures to be followed in implementing the special emphasis program. EPA has distributed the OSHA Notice\nto EPA regional o\ufb03ces participating in the PetroSEP program.\nIn addition, EPA is providing OSHA with an inventory of the chemicals used in signi\ufb01cant quantities at each facility\nand data on accidental releases that have occurred. EPA will provide technical assistance when requested by\nOSHA during chemical process safety reviews. Further, in the coming months, EPA inspectors will join the OSHA\nteams in at least six of the OSHA-targeted facilities to conduct \"multi-media\" inspections -- that is, inspections\nwhich encompass the gamut of EPA-administered programs, including clean air, clean water, toxic substances,\nand hazardous waste.\nA major purpose of this inspection program is to identify and correct industry practices that are potential\ncontributing causes of accidental explosions. EPA also has a direct role and interest in this activity. Serious\naccidents not only represent an imminent threat to the health and safety of the plant's employees but also have a\npotential to release large quantities of toxic materials into the environment.\nAt this time, EPA has provided OSHA with all submitted toxics release inventory data for the 28 facilities that are\nsubject to the OSHA special inspection program. These data provide OSHA inspection teams with valuable\ninformation, such as a list of chemicals that are used in signi\ufb01cant quantities by each facility. EPA is also providing\nOSHA with information concerning accidental releases.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 8/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Target Identi\ufb01cation & Selection of 28 Facilities Done\nEPA Generation & Delivery of EPGRA Toxic Release Inventory ReportsDone\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Subset of Facilities For Federal Inspections Done\nJoint OSHA-EPA PetroSEP Regional Coordination Meeting April 4, 1991\nOSHA-EPA PetroSEP Conference Calls; generally every three weeks Ongoing; generally every three weeks\nEPA Inspection of Six Facilities To begin April 30, 1991\nTarget Date For Completion of PetroSEP September 1992\nB. Lead Pollution Reduction Strategy For Smelters, Incinerators and Hazardous Waste Sites.\nEPA has established an inter-agency workgroup, in which OSHA participates, to address the risks posed by\nexposure to lead. EPA has been coordinating its activities with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure\nthat lead reduction activities do not run at cross-purposes with the programs and goals of other agencies. The\nO\ufb03ce of Enforcement is supporting this Agency e\ufb00ort by ensuring that current regulatory standards are being met\nby lead-emitting facilities. OSHA is developing additional regulatory and enforcement approaches to reduce\nworker exposure to lead. OSHA has an existing permissible exposure limit (PEL) and worker protection\nrequirements that address lead exposures in general industry, and a PEL for lead exposure in the construction\nindustry. OSHA has also inspected and issued \"egregious\" penalty actions against nine lead smelters.\nOSHA has given top priority to updating its lead standard for the construction industry. This rulemaking has been\nput on a fast track, and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is expected in the current \ufb01scal year. At the same time,\nOSHA will be lowering the permissible exposure limit for lead in construction, as part of its update of its Air\nContaminants Standard for that industry. Until the new rule for the construction industry is in place, OSHA will\nissue a Hazard Information Bulletin for employers and workers in that industry, alerting them to the hazards of\nlead, particularly of lead-based paint removal operations, and suggesting work practices and personal protective\nequipment to minimize harmful exposures.\nEPA has briefed OSHA sta\ufb00 on EPA's Lead Pollution Reduction and Enforcement Strategies. While OSHA is\nunable to target these same facilities for full-scale inspections in FY 1991, OSHA will inform the EPA of reports of\naccidents or worker complaints which would trigger an OSHA inspection. In this way, EPA and OSHA may be able\nto undertake a limited amount of joint enforcement activity in these facilities this year. Finally, OSHA has provided\nEPA with \ufb01les of egregious cases resulting from inspections at four of the targeted smelters and the results of\nOSHA's FY 1990 inspections in general industry where there were cited violations of the lead standard associated\nwith overexposure.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nEPA Development of Lead Strategy Done\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Lead Smelter Enforcement Targets Done\nOSHA Submission of Lead Health Data Done\nOSHA Submission of Worker Complaints To EPA on Selected Target Facilities Ongoing\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 9/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Issuance of Lead Hazard Information Bulletin March 1991\nEPA Issuance of Enforcement Actions July 1991\nC.

EPA will establish a written\nsystem for tracking referrals of potential violations discovered and reported by OSHA personnel to ensure that\nthey are properly recorded, acknowledged, and followed-up on.\nAt a minimum, each system will include:\nA. a system for tracking reports;\nB. identi\ufb01cation of responsibilities and accountability;\nC. a process for at least quarterly review of the referrals to ensure that proper review has been given to each\nsigni\ufb01cant item.\nAction Needed Timetable\nDevelopment of Tracking Systems April 30, 1991\nImplementation of Tracking Systems June 30, 1991\nReview of Tracking Systems and Followup on Referrals September 30, 1991\nD. Development of Specialized Training For Inspectors and Case Development O\ufb03cers of Respective Agency\nStatutes and Programs\nDiscussions are underway concerning training for EPA and OSHA inspectors. To be e\ufb00ective \"eyes and ears\" for\neach other's respective programs, it is essential that OSHA \ufb01eld personnel and EPA \ufb01eld personnel clearly\nunderstand the most serious concerns of each other's statutory and regulatory authorities. To this end, the\nagencies have agreed to provide the following training programs:\na. For senior managers and policy planners. Each agency will present an overview of how each agency conducts\nits enforcement program, including a summary of statutory requirements, authorities and priority areas. It is\nanticipated that this specialized training will be o\ufb00ered annually. The training will also be available to OSHA State\nPlan Designees and Consultation Project Directors.\nb. For inspectors. During the \ufb01rst year of this MOU, the primary focus will be on developing basic materials for\nincorporation into each other's inspector training programs. EPA and OSHA will establish and present training to\naid in the identi\ufb01cation of workplace or environmental hazards for the purpose of making referrals. Such training\nwill focus on providing a general understanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction and\nthe process for notifying, through a complaint and referral system, the other agency when potential violations\ncome to the inspectors attention. Special emphasis will be made on identifying cases or situations that suggest\napparent hazards which could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to workers, the public or environment, requiring prompt\nremediation.\nAction Needed Timetable\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 10/17Action Needed Timetable\nExchange of Existing EPA & OSHA Training Calendars Done\nTraining Developed For Senior Managers February 28, 1991\nDevelopment of Training Materials September 30, 1991\nE. Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring Data Exchange Program\nEach agency will identify key personnel to establish a Data Exchange Committee (DEC). The DEC will have overall\nresponsibility for implementing the data exchange section of the MOU. Data may be requested for general\ntargeting purposes, determining compliance histories or background information on speci\ufb01c facilities, industrial\nsegments or categories or related reasons. The exchange of Agency computer data bases on chemical\nmanagement, permits and compliance is a major focus of this workplan and the supplemental Agreement on Data\nExchange.\nThe initial task will be to identify the client community within each agency and the type of data of interest. The\nDEC will identify data managers and their systems to help identify speci\ufb01c data of interest. The DEC will facilitate\nunderstanding of each agency's data and data systems by exchanging data and system descriptions and by\nproviding presentations about data and data systems. Each Agency agrees to provide materials and assistance in\norder to understand the other agency's data.\nThe DEC will develop a framework within their respective client communities to identify and implement the most\ne\ufb03cient methodology to exchange data. This framework may include but is not limited to the exchange of\nhardcopy data reports, or exchange through electronic means and direct database access. Each agency agrees\nto provide training, when required, to directly access identi\ufb01ed databases.\nThe DEC will identify key individuals in each agency that will initiate, receive and coordinate data requests. These\nindividuals will be responsible for the data exchange. The DEC will agree on a process for each agency to follow\nwhen requesting data form the other agency.\nAction Needed Timetable\nIdentify OSHA & EPA Personnel for Data Exchange Committee February 28, 1991\nDEC identi\ufb01es client o\ufb03ces & data needs March 30, 1991\nDevelop framework to identify methods for e\ufb00ective data exchange April 30, 1991\nEstablish process for data exchange April 30, 1991\n3. Planning Activities for FY 1992\nThe main intent of the \ufb01rst annual workplan is to identify major enforcement initiatives that can readily be\nsupported by each agency. It is anticipated that information gathered in the course of implementing PetroSEP and\nthe Lead Initiative will generate a number of ideas and initiative areas for FY 1992. Understanding the\nfundamentals of how each agency operates and the extent of statutory duties and policy initiatives will allow the\nagencies to better target and implement initiatives for FY 1992.\nA planning meeting will be held during the \ufb01rst two weeks of June at which representatives of each Agency will\nrecommend areas for concentration based upon experiences in the \ufb01rst half of FY 1991. Areas of focus will\ninclude initiatives, training opportunities and needs, and improved use of data bases. A \ufb01nal workplan will be\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 11/17developed by October 1, 1991.\nAction Needed Timetable\nEach agency identi\ufb01es initial target areas for enforcement investigations in FY 1992 April 30, 1991\nCommunicate priority areas to regional/\ufb01eld o\ufb03ces for review/comment April 30, 1991\nOSHA-EPA meeting to discuss potential joint initiatives June 30, 1991\nFinalize MOU Workplan based on agency workplans July 30, 1991\nDevelop press strategy to highlight achievements in FY 1991 and to anounce goals for\nFY 1992September 30,\n1991\n4.

Background\nOn November 23, 1990, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) of the United States Department of Labor and the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. The Purpose of this MOU is to improve the working relationship\nbetween the agencies in the enforcement of their respective statutes and to maximize their e\ufb00orts to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment at facilities subject to EPA and OSHA\njurisdiction. The MOU provides for additional agreements to carry out training and data exchange between the\nagencies. This document establishes the terms of an Agreement on Training (Agreement) to support OSHA and\nEPA enforcement activities.\nII. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to provide the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA in developing and carrying out training in support of the MOU. OSHA and EPA will cooperate in developing\nand conducting periodic training programs for each other's personnel in the respective laws, regulations, and\ncompliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to ensure that valid referrals are made when potential\nviolations are found, and to support joint enforcement and inspection initiatives.\nIII. Target Group\nThe target group for this Agreement includes all present and future EPA and OSHA inspectors, who investigate\nworkplaces where hazards regulated by either OSHA, or EPA are likely to exist, and other appropriate personnel.\nIV. Training Focus\nEPA will support training of OSHA inspectors in recognizing environmental hazards for the purpose of making\nreferrals. Conversely, OSHA will support training of EPA inspectors in identifying workplace hazards so that they\ncan make referrals. Therefore, training of EPA and OSHA inspectors will focus on providing a general\nunderstanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction, signi\ufb01cant hazards regulated by the\nother agency, especially those requiring immediate remediation, and the procedures for notifying o\ufb03cials when\npotential violations come to the inspector's attention. After receiving instruction in the appropriate EPA and OSHA\nregulations, OSHA and EPA inspectors will be able to recognize and refer to the respective authorities those\ncases where apparent hazards could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to the workplace, public, or environment.\nV. Implementation\nA. Basic Training OSHA and EPA inspectors will receive training in the basic concepts of recognizing, evaluating,\nand controlling occupational and environmental hazards commonly found in the workplace. Each agency will\ndevelop appropriate materials on these matters for inclusion in the other agency's training program. The materials\nmay be based on training materials which already are part of each agency's inspector training program and will\nconsist of written materials as well as audio-visual modules. After both agencies have developed training\nmaterials, the materials will be exchanged and then delivered, as soon as possible, to present EPA and OSHA\ninspectors. The training materials will also be included in the basic inspector training programs required to be\ntaken by all new OSHA and EPA inspectors.\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 13/17B. Specialized Training\n1. Cross Training When appropriate and to the extent possible, EPA and OSHA will provide for attendance at\nexisting agency training courses for inspectors of the other agency.\n2. Joint Training As OSHA and EPA identify joint enforcement and inspection initiatives under the Annual Workplan\ncalled for in the MOU, EPA and OSHA will develop training materials and as appropriate conduct joint training for\nthe inspectors who will be carrying out those initiatives.\n3. Location Specialized training will be conducted at, but is not limited to, EPA's National Enforcement Training\nInstitute, EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center, and the OSHA Training Institute.\nC.

    "combined_text": "Dear Tracy Atagi and Tiffany Kollar,\n\nI am a toxicologist and public health professional and I am in favor of this proposed rule. While I may agree that the proposed rule serves to protect environmental and human health, my concern is in regards to Section IV Part B2 Proposed Requirements and Request for Comment on Puncturing and Draining at Small and Large Quantity Handlers. In this section, EPA acknowledges that simplifying disposal procedures for aerosol cans will lead to a greater number and volume of them being sent to small and large quantity handlers for puncturing and subsequent recycling. Furthermore, under the universal waste clause, aerosol cans will be able to be stored for a longer period of time prior to disposal, thereby increasing the number of cans punctured and disposed of by a facility at once. I believe that herein lies the greatest threat to environmental protectionshow does EPA specifically propose to address aerosol can puncturing if there is a significant increase in the number of cans needing to be processed?\n\nThe technology used to puncture aerosol cans, as all technology, is imperfect. In fact, through EPAs Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program, the agency has analyzed aerosol can puncturing devices and determined that at least one puncturing technology that is currently on the market and used by handlers had a tendency to malfunction after processing significantly fewer cans than as advertised by the distributor. These malfunctions include breakthrough of volatile chemicals and failure of locking mechanisms for the machine. Basic statistics indicates that the incidence of such malfunctions will increase as the sheer number of cans processed increases, as is expected with the proposed rule. While the proposed rule suggests many preventative procedures that handlers must include at minimum in a written standard operating procedure (SOP), the document neglects to mention any worker-related protections. I believe this to be a negligent oversight on the part of EPA, as it would fail to adequately protect human health.\n\nThe proposed rule states At minimum, EPA is proposing that the written procedure address the operation and maintenance of the unit including its proper assembly; segregation of incompatible wastes; and proper waste management practices. I believe that the final rule, in order to be truly comprehensive, should also include the phrase occupational safety guidelines including required PPE in minimal requirements for a written SOP. As the number of cans processed and, therefore, the number of machine malfunctions and leaks, increase, the likelihood of accidental worker exposure to hazards also increases. As such, the EPA would not be fulfilling its duty to protect human health if it were to neglect mandating worker protections in a written operating procedure. The state of Colorado, which has already adopted aerosol cans as universal waste, specifically states precautions that need to be taken to protect the worker should be included in the mandated written operating procedure (see Attachment 1). A federal rule, then, must also specifically address worker safety.\n\nSome may argue that it is not EPAs jurisdiction to ensure worker safety, and rather that is the jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). However, a 1991 Memorandum of Understanding between OSHA and EPA (see Attachment 2) suggests the opposite. The document emphasizes that the two agencies have overlapping authority and responsibility with regards to job site-related safety and health and indicates RCRA as one of EPAs statutes under which this is the case. As stated in the memorandum, EPA would ultimately defer to OSHA to determine if the worker safety precautions proposed in a written SOP are adequate. However, simply requiring that worker safety be taken into consideration, is not a gross overstep of EPAs jurisdiction.\n\nI commend EPA for addressing many of the potential problems related to puncturing aerosol cans. However, the agency should seriously consider the addition of worker-safety precautions in the minimum requirements for a written SOP, especially considering that the volume and number of cans processed is likely to increase as a result of the adoption of aerosol cans as universal waste.\n\n--- ATTACHMENT CONTENT: Attachment 1 - Management of Waste Aerosol Cans ---\n\n \nPage 1 of 4  \nCompliance Bulletin \nHazardous Waste  \nManagement of Waste Aerosol Cans  \nreviewed/revised August 2002 \nWhich aerosol cans are regulated as hazardous \nwaste?  \nAerosol cans sometimes need to be discarded before they are completely empty.  This occurs for a variety of reasons, including when the spray mechanism no \nlonger operates as designed, the propellant is spent, or \nthe product is no longer used.  In these cases it must be determined whether the contents\n remaining in the can \nare hazardous waste, either by exhibiting a characteristic  of hazardous waste (such as ignitability \n(D001)) or  because they are a  listed waste (such as \ntrichloroethylene (U228)) [Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 261].  It is important to remember that the contents remaining in an aerosol can would not be considered spent and therefore could not carry the F-codes for spent solvents.  An aerosol can \nmay, however, carry a P- or U-code for unused \nchemical products.    While residential consumers are exempt from the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations, businesses, \nschools and government facilities that generate \nhazardous wastes must follow these requirements regarding proper management and disposal of hazardous wastes applicable for their generator category.  Generators of waste aerosol cans are responsible for determining if their wastes are \nhazardous.  If the contents of the aerosol cans are \nhazardous, they must be managed in compliance with the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations [6 CCR 1007-3].    Which aerosol cans are not\n regulated as hazardous \nwaste? \n \nAerosol cans that are still in use or that contain useable \nproduct are not yet considered wastes.  Aerosol cans that are empty or that contain materials that are not \nconsidered hazardous wastes may be managed as solid \nwaste.  \nHow should aerosol cans determined to contain \nhazardous waste be managed? \n \nIn the past, if an aerosol can contained a hazardous waste, it needed to be managed in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, \ntraining and manifesting requirements, as well as restrictive time limits. The Colorado Hazardous Waste \nCommission has adopted reduced management prac-\ntices for aerosol cans containing hazardous waste under the Universal Waste Rule.  Therefore, someone who generates aerosol cans containing hazardous waste may choose to manage these cans in full compliance with \nParts 260 through 268, Parts 99 and 100 of the Colo-\nrado Hazardous Waste Regulations, or with the re-duced requirements of Part 273, Universal Waste Rule. \n \nWhat are Universal Wastes? \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule [6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273] includes certain hazardous wastes that are commonly generated by very small to very large non-residential \nsources such as businesses, government agencies, and \nschools.  Universal wastes are subject to wide-spread \nuse, which makes disposal of these hazardous wastes difficult to control.     \n \n     \n \n Materials included as universal wastes are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and have been required to be handled as \nhazardous wastes since the early 1980s.  In the past, if \nthese wastes were determined to be a hazardous waste, small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste needed to manage them in full compliance with the hazardous waste regulations, including labeling, employee training, manifest requirements, and \nrestrictive time limits. [6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 260 - 268, \n99, 100]   \n \nWhy manage waste aerosol ca ns as universal waste?  \n \nManaging aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as \nuniversal wastes is most beneficial to small and large quantity generators of hazardous waste, or conditionally exempt small quantity generators that \nwould otherwise be small qua ntity generators if they \ndid not manage some of their wastes as universal \nUniversal Wastes include many: \n\uf0b7 batteries \n\uf0b7 pesticides \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing devices \n\uf0b7 mercury-containing lighting wastes \n\uf0b7 aerosol cans  \n\uf0b7 electronic devices and components \n \nPage 2 of 4 wastes.   The primary benef its of choosing the reduced \nmanagement standards of the universal waste rule are that the waste does not count toward the monthly total \nof hazardous waste in determining generator category; \nthe waste can be shipped in Colorado without a hazardous waste manifest; the waste can be shipped by common carrier instead of a hazardous waste transporter; there are reduced notification and record-keeping requirements, and the storage time limits are \nless restrictive.    \n Since universal waste does not require a hazardous waste manifest for shipment in Colorado, it is not considered hazardous waste under US Department of \nTransportation regulations.  Other states may have \nmore stringent requirements for these wastes, however, and may require use of the hazardous waste manifest.  State requirements for universal waste transporters are \nincluded in 6 CCR 1007-3 Part 273 Subpart D.   \n \nWhat are the requirements for universal waste \nmanagement? \n \nCategories of Universal Waste Handlers  \n \nUnder the Universal Waste Rule, persons who generate or accumulate aerosol cans containing hazardous waste are considered \u201chandlers\u201d of universal waste. [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  [Note: this definition is different from that of a generator  of hazardous waste]. \n \nThere are two categories of handlers, Small Quantity \nHandlers of Universal Waste and Large Quantity Handlers of Universal Waste.  A small quantity handler of universal waste is one who does not accumulate more than 5,000 kilograms of universal at any one \ntime.  A large quantity handler of universal waste is a \nhandler of universal waste who accumulates 5,000 kilograms or more of universal waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9]  The designation of small quantity or large quantity handler of universal waste has no \nrelationship to a facility\u2019s hazardous waste generator  \nstatus.  Thus a small quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a large quantity handler of universal waste, and a facility that is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste may be a small quantity handler of universal waste. \n \nIf, at any time during the calendar year, a facility ex-ceeds the quantities for a small quantity handler of universal waste, they woul d be considered a large \nquantity handler until the next calendar year when they \ncan reevaluate their status.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.9] Notification  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are not required to notify the Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division (the Division) of their universal \nwaste management activities.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.12]  Large quantity handlers of universal waste are required to notify the Division of their universal waste management activities and obtain an EPA identification number using EPA Form 8700-12.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.32]  This must be done even \nif the facility has previously given notification and \nreceived an EPA identification number for its hazardous waste activities.  The EPA identification number will remain the same.    \nAccumulation of Waste  \n \nThe Universal Waste Rule was designed to streamline \nthe regulatory process and encourage recycling.  \nTherefore, a handler of universal waste cannot dispose of the waste without a permit and treatment is not allowed except under certain specified conditions in Part 273 of the Colorado h azardous waste regulations \n[6 CCR 1007-3].  All handlers of universal waste are \nrequired to manage their waste in a manner that prevents releases of the waste or waste constituents.  There is a one year accumulation time limit, and handlers must be able to demonstrate that universal \nwaste on site has not been accumulated for more than \none year.  Although it is not required to be marked with the accumulation start date, this would be the easiest way to document that the waste is in compliance with the one year accumulation limit.  \nLabeling  \n \nWhen a universal waste aerosol can is generated, it must either be labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Can\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Can,\u201d or be put into an accumulation container labeled as \u201cWaste Aerosol Cans\u201d or \u201cUniversal Waste Aerosol Cans.\u201d  If the \naerosol can is placed into an accumulation container, \nonly the accumulation container needs to be labeled as containing waste aerosol cans, not the individual cans within it.  If the individual aerosol can is not in good condition and is leaking or shows signs that it could leak, it must be individually over packed in a container \nthat is labeled.  If the accu mulation container is not in \ngood condition, it must be over packed or the cans must be removed and put into a container that is in good condition.  \n \nPage 3 of 4 Shipment of Waste  \n \nA universal waste handler cannot dispose of universal \nwaste on site without a permit, and treatment by the handler is not allowed exce pt under limited conditions \n(see the section on handler treatment). Universal waste \ncan only be shipped to another universal waste handler, a destination facility or a foreign destination.  Ship-ment to another universal waste handler is allowed to aid in consolidation of wastes.  A destination facility is a facility that is permitted to treat, dispose, or recycle \nthe waste.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.9] \nShipment of universal waste in Colorado does not require the use of the hazardous waste manifest system.  Therefore, universal waste is not considered hazardous waste under US DOT regulations.  Some universal \nwastes are regulated by the US DOT as hazardous \nmaterials because they meet criteria for one or more hazard classes, but the word \"waste\" may not be used in the shipping name.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.52]   \nOther states may have different requirements for \nwastes that are managed as universal waste in \nColorado.  The handler should always confirm the regulatory status of universal wastes in the destination state and all intervening states the waste will travel through. \n \nEmployee Training  \n \nSmall quantity handlers of universal waste are required \nto inform all employees who manage universal waste about the proper handling and emergency procedures appropriate to the types of universal waste at the facility.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.16] Large \nquantity handlers of universal waste are required to \nensure that personnel are thoroughly familiar with the requirements for universal waste management and emergency response relative to their level of responsibilities in dealing with the waste.  [6 CCR \n1007-3 Section 273.36] \n \nHandlers of waste aerosol cans who puncture aerosol \ncans are required to ensure that personnel thoroughly understand how to safely operate the puncturing device, as well as how to safely manage the waste \ngenerated from the puncturing operation. \n \nSpills  \n \nAll handlers of universal waste are required to \nimmediately containerize and appropriately manage any spills or residues from releases of universal wastes.  \n[6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(a), 273.37(a)]  The \nwaste generated from a release of universal waste would be considered newly generated waste, and a \nhazardous waste determination would need to be made.  If it is determined that any or all of the released \nmaterial or residue is hazardous, it must be managed in \naccordance with the hazardous waste regulations and not the universal waste requirements.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Sections 273.17(b), 273.37(b)]  The handler of the universal waste at the time of the release would be the generator of the newly generated hazardous waste and \nmust adhere to all applicable requirements of the \nColorado hazardous waste regulations.    \nRecord Keeping Requirements  \n \nA small quantity handler of universal waste is not required to maintain records.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section \n273.19]  However, it is strongly advisable to keep \nadequate records to document waste management practices and substantiate the facility\u2019s universal waste handler status.    A large quantity handler of universal waste must keep \nwritten records for universal wastes shipped to and \nfrom its facilities.  These records must be kept for at least three years and include:  the types and quantities of universal waste shipped or received, the date the waste was shipped or received, and to whom the waste \nwas shipped.  [6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.39]  There is \nno requirement to maintain formal training records for either category.  Transporters of universal waste are required to keep records in accordance with US DOT requirements.  A \ndestination facility is subject to all applicable \nrequirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 Parts 264-268, 99 & 100.  If the destination facility recycles the universal waste without storing it, they need only notify the Department of their activity under 6 CCR 1007-3 Part \n99 and keep records of each shipment.  If the \ndestination facility is a Treatment Storage and Disposal Facility (TSDF), they are required to keep records in accordance with their hazardous waste permit.  Can a universal waste handler treat its hazardous wastes? \n \nUniversal waste handlers can\u2019t dispose of universal wastes without a permit and treatment by the handler is not allowed except under limited conditions. \n \nPuncturing waste aerosol cans  \n \nPuncturing of waste aerosol cans is allowed by \nuniversal waste handlers as long as it is conducted in accordance with the requirements of Part 273.13 or \n \nPage 4 of 4 273.33 of the Colorado Hazardous Waste Regulations.  \nPrior to puncturing waste aerosol cans, the handler must develop and implement a written procedure \ndetailing how to puncture the cans safely.  Included in \nthis document must be the type of equipment to be used, operation and maintenance of the equipment and the precautions that need to be taken to protect the worker.  In addition, the document must include a review of the wastes that will be generated from the \npuncturing activities and an outline of how \nincompatible wastes will be  segregated prior to and \nafter puncturing.  Special management procedures necessary to manage the waste properly, such as ensuring that flammable wastes are stored away from \nheat or open flames, also need to be evaluated prior to \npuncturing.  Additionally, this procedure must detail the frequency of filter change out, if applicable. [Note: it may be necessary to file an Air Pollution Emission Notice (APEN) for the puncturing operation and to use \ncontrol devices to capture air borne contamination.]  A \nspill kit must be readily av ailable in case wastes are \nspilled during the puncturing activities.  Once the puncturing activity occurs, the contents from the can or the puncturing device must be transferred to \na container meeting the requirements of 6 CCR 1007-3 \nSection 262.34.  At the point the material is removed from the can, it is considered a hazardous waste and must be managed in accordance with all hazardous waste regulations.  It can no longer be managed as \nuniversal waste.  The quantity of waste generated from \nthe punctured cans must be included in the determina-tion of generator status.  All applicable generator \nrequirements contained in Part 262 apply to this newly generated waste including accumulation time limits.   \nOnce the waste aerosol cans have been emptied, they \ncan be managed as a RCRA empty container and either recycled as scrap metal or disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations.  What about Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators (CESQG)? \n \nConditionally exempt small quantity generators are \nthose that generate less than 100 kilograms \n(approximately 25 gallons or 250 pounds) of total \nhazardous waste and no more than one kilogram of acutely hazardous waste per calendar month AND never accumulate more th an 1000 kilograms of \nhazardous waste on site at one time.  In Colorado, \nconditionally exempt generators are not excused from \nidentifying which of their wastes are hazardous wastes and must ensure that their wastes are sent to a facility that is permitted to accept it.   Conditionally exempt small quantity generators may \nchoose to manage their aerosol cans containing hazardous waste as conditionally exempt wastes or as \nuniversal wastes. [ 6 CCR 1007-3 Section 273.8 ]  \nBecause of the reduced management requirements already applicable to c onditionally exempt small \nquantity generators of hazar dous waste, it is generally \nnot to their benefit to manage their wastes as universal waste, unless they would ot herwise be small quantity \ngenerators.  Unlike small a nd large quantity generators \nof hazardous waste, conditionally exempt generators are not required to notify the State of their regulated waste activity or to get an EPA identification number.  There is no time limit on how long they may store their \nhazardous waste on site as long as they don\u2019t exceed \nthe quantity limits for conditionally exempt small quantity generators, and they may transport their hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest under a standard bill of lading.   \n \nConditionally exempt genera tors may not dispose of \ntheir hazardous wastes on site or send them to a solid waste landfill in Colorado.  These wastes must be sent to a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal (TSD) facility, sent to a legitimate recycler of \nthe waste, or sent to an out-of-state solid waste \ndisposal facility that is permitted to accept conditionally exempt small quantity generator hazardous wastes.

February 13, 1991 ---\n\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 1/17Memorandums of Understanding (/laws-regs/mou/publicationdate) /\u00a0MOU between OSHA and EPA\nInformation Date:02/13/1991\nAgreement Agency:Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nMemorandum of Understanding \nbetween \nThe U.S. Department of Labor \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration \nand \nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nOf\ufb01ce of Enforcement\nI. Purpose\nThe purpose of this interagency Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to establish and improve the working\nrelationship between the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Department of Labor. The goals of the agencies are\nto improve the combined e\ufb00orts of the agencies to achieve protection of workers, the public, and the environment\nat facilities subject to EPA and OSHA jurisdiction; to delineate the general areas of responsibility of each agency;\nto provide guidelines for coordination of interface activities between the two agencies with the overall goal of\nidentifying and minimizing environmental or workplace hazards.\nThis MOU establishes a process and framework for noti\ufb01cation, consultation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA to aid both agencies in identifying environmental and workplace health and safety problems and to more\ne\ufb00ectively implement enforcement of our national workplace and environmental statutes.\nThis MOU is intended to improve the information exchange relating to job-site safety and health, protection of the\npublic health and environment thereby reducing the potential for workplace related injury, death, and\nenvironmental contamination. This MOU implements OSHA's authority under the Occupational Safety and Health\nAct of 1970 (OSH Act) and EPA's general and statute-speci\ufb01c authorities to enter into agreements with other\nfederal agencies to further the legislative objectives of Congress and the President.\nII. Background & Responsibilities\nEPA and OSHA have the statutory responsibility to ensure the safety and health of the public and America's\nworkforce through the timely and e\ufb00ective implementation of a number of federal laws and implementing\nregulations. In some areas, the responsibilities of the agencies are separate and distinct. In others, they are\ncomplementary. EPA and OSHA wish to work together to maximize the e\ufb00orts of both agencies to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment.\nA. EPA Responsibilities\nEPA responsibilities include the protection of public health and the environment by assuring compliance with\nfederal environmental statutes and regulations. Agency functions are performed through standards setting and\nrulemaking; technical reviews; audits and studies; conduct of public hearings; issuance of permits and licenses;\ncompliance inspections; investigations and enforcement; and evaluation of operating experience and research.\nB. OSHA Responsibilities\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 2/17OSHA is responsible for enforcing the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651 et. seq. The goal of the OSH Act is to assure so far\nas possible every working man and woman in the nation safe and healthful working conditions. To achieve that\npurpose, the Act provides broad authority for a variety of activities and programs designed to reduce the number\nof occupational safety and health hazards at places of employment. Among these is the authority to promulgate\nmandatory safety and health standards for private sector workplaces, and to conduct inspections of such\nworkplaces to determine compliance with the Act and with OSHA standards. When violations are found, OSHA is\nauthorized to issue citations to employers, propose penalties, and require abatement of hazards. In cases\ninvolving imminent dangers, OSHA is authorized to seek injunctive relief in U.S. District Court. In states which\nhave elected to administer State occupational safety and health programs, or \"State plans,\" the Act requires\nOSHA to conduct a continuing evaluation of State operations and, in certain circumstances, to provide a program\nof concurrent federal OSHA enforcement.\nC. Applicable Statutes\nUnder the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 651, every employer has a general duty, under section 5(a)(1), to furnish\nemployment and a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to\ncause, serious physical harm. Every employer is also required, under section 5(a)(2), to comply with occupational\nsafety and health standards promulgated by OSHA. In addition, employers must comply with regulations\nprescribed by OSHA under section 8 of the Act, which pertains to the conduct of workplace inspections among\nother things, and must furnish such records and other information as may be requested under section 24 of the\nAct.\nPrincipal EPA laws include but are not limited to:\nThe Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act:\n15 U.S.C. 2641; governing the removal of asbestos.\nThe Clean Air Act:\n42 U.S.C.

General Operating Procedures For Interagency Activity\nIn recognition of the agencies' statutory authorities and responsibilities enumerated above, the following\nprocedures will be followed:\nA. COORDINATION\n1. There will be the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and OSHA, at all organizational\nlevels, in developing and carrying out training, data and information exchange, technical and professional\nassistance, referrals of alleged violations, and related matters concerning compliance and law enforcement\nactivity to ensure the health and well-being of the Nation's workforce, the general public, and the environment.\n2. By January 1, 1991, and by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year, EPA and OSHA will develop an\nannual workplan to identify and de\ufb01ne the priorities to be addressed during the year. This workplan will include an\nidenti\ufb01cation of speci\ufb01c types of facilities to be jointly addressed during the year.\n3. EPA and OSHA will exchange names and phone numbers of appropriate agency headquarters, regional and\n\ufb01eld personnel, including personnel in OSHA area o\ufb03ces, and in state program o\ufb03ces. All information will be kept\nup to date by both agencies. Each EPA and OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will designate a point of contact for carrying\nout interface activities. Each agency agrees to prepare and distribute to all \ufb01eld personnel a suitable directive\noutlining a policy concerning the e\ufb00ective implementation of this MOU, and to identify appropriate points of\ncontact. In order to aid in the enforcement and issue-referral process, the agencies will update this information as\nthe need arises and will ensure that managers and \ufb01eld personnel are provided with a copy of this MOU and the\nrelevant directive.\n4. Resolution of interagency policy issues concerning this MOU and speci\ufb01c areas of implementation will be\ncoordinated between EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy. Resolution of issues\nconcerning inspection and enforcement activity involving both EPA and OSHA jurisdiction also will be coordinated\nby EPA's O\ufb03ce of Enforcement and OSHA's Directorate of Policy.\nB. INSPECTIONS\n1. EPA and OSHA may conduct joint inspections as necessary to carry out the legislative purposes of the\nrespective statutory authorities. Such inspections may be in accordance with an annual workplan which is\ndeveloped by the two agencies and identi\ufb01es areas for joint initiatives. Such inspections may also be scheduled\non an ad hoc basis such as in investigations following accidents or fatalities or injuries to workers resulting from\nreported activities or situations subject to either EPA OR OSHA jurisdiction.\n2. EPA and OSHA inspectors, in the course of conducting separate inspections, may discover situations involving\npotential violations of the other agency's laws or regulations. In those instances, referrals to the appropriate o\ufb03ce\nwill be undertaken as described below.\nC. REFERRALS\n1. For law enforcement purposes, OSHA and EPA shall develop a regular system to track and manage referrals of\npotential violations, allegations of violations, or situations requiring inspection, evaluation or followup by either\nAgency, as appropriate.\n2. Although EPA does not conduct inspections for occupational safety, in the course of an EPA inspection, EPA\npersonnel may identify safety concerns within the area of OSHA responsibility or may receive complaints about\nthe safety or health of employees related to their working conditions. In such instances, EPA will bring the matter\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 4/17to the attention of OSHA designated contacts in the Regional O\ufb03ce. EPA inspectors are not to perform the role of\nOSHA inspectors; however, they will refer worker health and safety issues to OSHA pursuant to the procedures\nset forth in the MOU and implementing agency directives. In the case of worker complaints, EPA will disclose the\nname of individuals to OSHA but will not further disclose the name and the identity of the employee. When such\ninstances occur within OSHA State-plan States' jurisdiction, the OSHA Regional O\ufb03ce will refer the matter to the\nState for appropriate action.\n3. OSHA will inform the EPA Regional Administrator or appropriate EPA o\ufb03ce of matters which appear to be\nsubject to EPA jurisdiction when these come to their attention during Federal or State safety and health\ninspections or through worker complaints. Although not exhaustive, the following are examples of matters that\nwould be reported to the EPA:\na. Worker allegations of signi\ufb01cant adverse reactions to a chemical or chemical substance which poses a\npotential hazard to public health or the environment.\nb. Accidental, unpermitted, or deliberate releases of chemicals or chemical substances beyond the workplace.\nc. Unsafe handling, storage, or use practices involving chemicals, chemical substances, or waste materials in\napparent violation of EPA-administered laws.\nd. Other readily detectible potential violations of EPA-administered laws, such as by-passing treatment systems.\ne. Asbestos dispersal or contamination a\ufb00ecting the public or the environment.\n4. EPA shall respond to referrals from OSHA, and OSHA shall respond to referrals from EPA, concerning potential\nviolations of the other agency's requirements, when appropriate, by conducting investigations in a timely manner.\nReferrals shall be evaluated and appropriate action will be taken.\n5. OSHA will work to facilitate referrals of potential violations of EPA regulations to EPA and will encourage the\nrelevant State agencies in those States which operate their own occupational safety and health programs (under a\nplan approved by OSHA under Section 18 of the OSH Act) also to make such referrals. EPA will work to facilitate\nreferrals to OSHA or OSHA State-plan States of potential violations of occupational health and safety standards\nor regulations discovered by federal or state environmental inspection activities.\n6. EPA and OSHA will conduct periodic meetings, as necessary, to report on the progress of actions taken on the\nother agency's referrals and to evaluate the e\ufb00ectiveness of the referral system and operating procedures. Both\nagencies agree to establish a system to monitor the progress of actions taken on referrals.\n7. OSHA will encourage State-plan States to respond to referrals from EPA and State agencies concerning\npotential violations of the States' occupational safety and health standards or regulations by conducting\ninvestigations in a timely manner. OSHA will further encourage State-plan States to participate in all training and\ninformation-sharing activities established under this MOU.\nD. DATA EXCHANGE\nEPA and OSHA agree to exchange information relating to complaints, inspections of investigations, violations\ndiscovered, imposition of civil monetary penalties, or other legal actions taken to enforce pertinent laws and\nregulations, and all other information necessary to ensure e\ufb00ective and coordinated law enforcement. This MOU\ncontemplates data exchange through both hard copy and computer data bases, in accordance with procedures\nto be established in a separate agreement.\nE. TRAINING\nEPA and OSHA will cooperate in developing and conducting periodic training programs for each other's\npersonnel in the respective laws, regulations, and compliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to\nensure that valid referrals are made when potential violations are found and to support joint enforcement and\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 5/17inspection initiatives. This MOU contemplates exchanges of appropriate training materials and information and\ndevelopment of specialized training activities in accordance with procedures to be established in a separate\nagreement.\nIV. Period of Agreement\nThis MOU shall continue in e\ufb00ect unless modi\ufb01ed in writing by mutual consent of both parties or terminated by\neither party upon 30 days advance written notice to the other.\nThis MOU does not preclude either Agency from entering into separate agreements setting forth procedures for\nother special programs which can be addressed more e\ufb03ciently and expeditiously by special agreement.\nV. Implementation\nNothing in this Agreement is intended to diminish or other-wise e\ufb00ect the authority of either agency to implement\nits respective statutory function. This Agreement is e\ufb00ective upon signature by both parties.\nFY 1991 WORKPLAN, AGREEMENT ON TRAINING \n& AGREEMENT ON DATA EXCHANGEU.S. Department of Labor\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration\n_______________________________\nGerard F.

OSHA-EPA Memorandum of Understanding\nThe Secretary of the Department of Labor and Administraton of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nsigned a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on November 23, 1990 with the goal of establishing a program\nfor improved environmental and workplace health and safety. Implementation of the program is to be coordinated\nprimarily by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and EPA O\ufb03ce of Enforcement. Although\nthe two agencies have worked cooperatively together in the past on a number of issues and investigation, no\ncomprehensive structure existed to focus that cooperative e\ufb00ort nationally. Having such a comprehensive\nstructure is particularly critical given the potential overlapping of EPA-OSHA responsibilities and the need to\nassure the most e\ufb00ective use of limited Federal resources.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding provides for coordination of the two agencies' general enforcement activities\nas well as joint inspections of facilities believed to be in violation of federal workplace or environmental standards;\nfacilities the exchange of technical information, computer data bases and other information to allow for better\ntargeting of inspections; and provides for cross-training programs.\nThe MOU requires that a number of speci\ufb01c actions be taken, including the development of a workplan for 1991\nwith subsequent annual workplans to be developed by the beginning of each succeeding \ufb01scal year. Separate\nagreements to implement training and data exchange have been developed to supplement this workplan.\n2. Speci\ufb01c Initiatives Identi\ufb01ed For Implementation in FY 1991\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 7/17Initial implementation will focus on two major initiatives beginning immediately. These are OSHA's petrochemical\n\"special emphasis\" inspection program (PetroSEP) and EPA's lead pollution reduction strategy. Although each\nproject was developed independently by each Agency, it is apparent that OSHA and EPA have a direct and\nindependent regulatory and enforcement interest in the successful combined implementation of these programs.\nPrior experience suggests that facilities with EPA violations have probable OSHA violations as well. In addition,\nbasic procedures for training and data exchange will be developed and implemented during FY 1991.\nA. OSHA Special Emphasis Program in Petrochemical Industries, Standard Industrial Classi\ufb01cation (SIC) Codes\n2821, 2869 and 2911; \"PetroSEP\"\nIncreased concern about petrochemical plant operations comes as the result of recent explosions in the chemical\nindustry. Explosions at the Phillips Houston Chemical Complex in Texas, ARCO in Channelview, Texas, and BASF\nCorporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, have left more than 40 workers dead. OSHA and EPA are committed to\nstrengthening e\ufb00orts in the chemical industry to prevent and mitigate the e\ufb00ects on workers, the public, and the\nenvironment of chemical accidents.\nThis workplan for the initial year of the MOU builds upon high priority enforcement initiatives already under way in\neach agency. OSHA has committed extensive compliance resources to a special emphasis inspection program in\n28 major petrochemical facilities, PetroSEP is designed to focus primarily on management systems governing the\nhealth and safety procedures for maintenance activities, contractor activities, and general operations including\ncompliance with regulations to control risk and prevent disaster.\nAreas for special review include the following standard industrial classi\ufb01cation (SIC):\n1. Plastic Materials; Synthetic Resins and Nonvulcanizable Elastomers; SIC Code: 2821\n2. Industrial Organic Chemicals; not elsewhere classi\ufb01ed; SIC Code 2869\n3. Petroleum Re\ufb01ning; SIC Code 2911\nThis review is limited to facilities in OSHA Regions II, III, V, and VI. EPA Regions II, III, V and VI correspond to\nOSHA regions for this initiative. EPA has designated contacts at the EPA Regional Division Director level to\ncoordinate joint inspection activity with OSHA. OSHA has prepared and distributed a Notice describing the\nPetroSEP program to a\ufb00ected OSHA regional o\ufb03ces. This notice includes applicable policy directives and\nprocedures to be followed in implementing the special emphasis program. EPA has distributed the OSHA Notice\nto EPA regional o\ufb03ces participating in the PetroSEP program.\nIn addition, EPA is providing OSHA with an inventory of the chemicals used in signi\ufb01cant quantities at each facility\nand data on accidental releases that have occurred. EPA will provide technical assistance when requested by\nOSHA during chemical process safety reviews. Further, in the coming months, EPA inspectors will join the OSHA\nteams in at least six of the OSHA-targeted facilities to conduct \"multi-media\" inspections -- that is, inspections\nwhich encompass the gamut of EPA-administered programs, including clean air, clean water, toxic substances,\nand hazardous waste.\nA major purpose of this inspection program is to identify and correct industry practices that are potential\ncontributing causes of accidental explosions. EPA also has a direct role and interest in this activity. Serious\naccidents not only represent an imminent threat to the health and safety of the plant's employees but also have a\npotential to release large quantities of toxic materials into the environment.\nAt this time, EPA has provided OSHA with all submitted toxics release inventory data for the 28 facilities that are\nsubject to the OSHA special inspection program. These data provide OSHA inspection teams with valuable\ninformation, such as a list of chemicals that are used in signi\ufb01cant quantities by each facility. EPA is also providing\nOSHA with information concerning accidental releases.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 8/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Target Identi\ufb01cation & Selection of 28 Facilities Done\nEPA Generation & Delivery of EPGRA Toxic Release Inventory ReportsDone\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Subset of Facilities For Federal Inspections Done\nJoint OSHA-EPA PetroSEP Regional Coordination Meeting April 4, 1991\nOSHA-EPA PetroSEP Conference Calls; generally every three weeks Ongoing; generally every three weeks\nEPA Inspection of Six Facilities To begin April 30, 1991\nTarget Date For Completion of PetroSEP September 1992\nB. Lead Pollution Reduction Strategy For Smelters, Incinerators and Hazardous Waste Sites.\nEPA has established an inter-agency workgroup, in which OSHA participates, to address the risks posed by\nexposure to lead. EPA has been coordinating its activities with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure\nthat lead reduction activities do not run at cross-purposes with the programs and goals of other agencies. The\nO\ufb03ce of Enforcement is supporting this Agency e\ufb00ort by ensuring that current regulatory standards are being met\nby lead-emitting facilities. OSHA is developing additional regulatory and enforcement approaches to reduce\nworker exposure to lead. OSHA has an existing permissible exposure limit (PEL) and worker protection\nrequirements that address lead exposures in general industry, and a PEL for lead exposure in the construction\nindustry. OSHA has also inspected and issued \"egregious\" penalty actions against nine lead smelters.\nOSHA has given top priority to updating its lead standard for the construction industry. This rulemaking has been\nput on a fast track, and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is expected in the current \ufb01scal year. At the same time,\nOSHA will be lowering the permissible exposure limit for lead in construction, as part of its update of its Air\nContaminants Standard for that industry. Until the new rule for the construction industry is in place, OSHA will\nissue a Hazard Information Bulletin for employers and workers in that industry, alerting them to the hazards of\nlead, particularly of lead-based paint removal operations, and suggesting work practices and personal protective\nequipment to minimize harmful exposures.\nEPA has briefed OSHA sta\ufb00 on EPA's Lead Pollution Reduction and Enforcement Strategies. While OSHA is\nunable to target these same facilities for full-scale inspections in FY 1991, OSHA will inform the EPA of reports of\naccidents or worker complaints which would trigger an OSHA inspection. In this way, EPA and OSHA may be able\nto undertake a limited amount of joint enforcement activity in these facilities this year. Finally, OSHA has provided\nEPA with \ufb01les of egregious cases resulting from inspections at four of the targeted smelters and the results of\nOSHA's FY 1990 inspections in general industry where there were cited violations of the lead standard associated\nwith overexposure.\nACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nEPA Development of Lead Strategy Done\nEPA Identi\ufb01cation of Lead Smelter Enforcement Targets Done\nOSHA Submission of Lead Health Data Done\nOSHA Submission of Worker Complaints To EPA on Selected Target Facilities Ongoing\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 9/17ACTION NEEDED TIMETABLE\nOSHA Issuance of Lead Hazard Information Bulletin March 1991\nEPA Issuance of Enforcement Actions July 1991\nC.

EPA will establish a written\nsystem for tracking referrals of potential violations discovered and reported by OSHA personnel to ensure that\nthey are properly recorded, acknowledged, and followed-up on.\nAt a minimum, each system will include:\nA. a system for tracking reports;\nB. identi\ufb01cation of responsibilities and accountability;\nC. a process for at least quarterly review of the referrals to ensure that proper review has been given to each\nsigni\ufb01cant item.\nAction Needed Timetable\nDevelopment of Tracking Systems April 30, 1991\nImplementation of Tracking Systems June 30, 1991\nReview of Tracking Systems and Followup on Referrals September 30, 1991\nD. Development of Specialized Training For Inspectors and Case Development O\ufb03cers of Respective Agency\nStatutes and Programs\nDiscussions are underway concerning training for EPA and OSHA inspectors. To be e\ufb00ective \"eyes and ears\" for\neach other's respective programs, it is essential that OSHA \ufb01eld personnel and EPA \ufb01eld personnel clearly\nunderstand the most serious concerns of each other's statutory and regulatory authorities. To this end, the\nagencies have agreed to provide the following training programs:\na. For senior managers and policy planners. Each agency will present an overview of how each agency conducts\nits enforcement program, including a summary of statutory requirements, authorities and priority areas. It is\nanticipated that this specialized training will be o\ufb00ered annually. The training will also be available to OSHA State\nPlan Designees and Consultation Project Directors.\nb. For inspectors. During the \ufb01rst year of this MOU, the primary focus will be on developing basic materials for\nincorporation into each other's inspector training programs. EPA and OSHA will establish and present training to\naid in the identi\ufb01cation of workplace or environmental hazards for the purpose of making referrals. Such training\nwill focus on providing a general understanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction and\nthe process for notifying, through a complaint and referral system, the other agency when potential violations\ncome to the inspectors attention. Special emphasis will be made on identifying cases or situations that suggest\napparent hazards which could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to workers, the public or environment, requiring prompt\nremediation.\nAction Needed Timetable\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 10/17Action Needed Timetable\nExchange of Existing EPA & OSHA Training Calendars Done\nTraining Developed For Senior Managers February 28, 1991\nDevelopment of Training Materials September 30, 1991\nE. Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring Data Exchange Program\nEach agency will identify key personnel to establish a Data Exchange Committee (DEC). The DEC will have overall\nresponsibility for implementing the data exchange section of the MOU. Data may be requested for general\ntargeting purposes, determining compliance histories or background information on speci\ufb01c facilities, industrial\nsegments or categories or related reasons. The exchange of Agency computer data bases on chemical\nmanagement, permits and compliance is a major focus of this workplan and the supplemental Agreement on Data\nExchange.\nThe initial task will be to identify the client community within each agency and the type of data of interest. The\nDEC will identify data managers and their systems to help identify speci\ufb01c data of interest. The DEC will facilitate\nunderstanding of each agency's data and data systems by exchanging data and system descriptions and by\nproviding presentations about data and data systems. Each Agency agrees to provide materials and assistance in\norder to understand the other agency's data.\nThe DEC will develop a framework within their respective client communities to identify and implement the most\ne\ufb03cient methodology to exchange data. This framework may include but is not limited to the exchange of\nhardcopy data reports, or exchange through electronic means and direct database access. Each agency agrees\nto provide training, when required, to directly access identi\ufb01ed databases.\nThe DEC will identify key individuals in each agency that will initiate, receive and coordinate data requests. These\nindividuals will be responsible for the data exchange. The DEC will agree on a process for each agency to follow\nwhen requesting data form the other agency.\nAction Needed Timetable\nIdentify OSHA & EPA Personnel for Data Exchange Committee February 28, 1991\nDEC identi\ufb01es client o\ufb03ces & data needs March 30, 1991\nDevelop framework to identify methods for e\ufb00ective data exchange April 30, 1991\nEstablish process for data exchange April 30, 1991\n3. Planning Activities for FY 1992\nThe main intent of the \ufb01rst annual workplan is to identify major enforcement initiatives that can readily be\nsupported by each agency. It is anticipated that information gathered in the course of implementing PetroSEP and\nthe Lead Initiative will generate a number of ideas and initiative areas for FY 1992. Understanding the\nfundamentals of how each agency operates and the extent of statutory duties and policy initiatives will allow the\nagencies to better target and implement initiatives for FY 1992.\nA planning meeting will be held during the \ufb01rst two weeks of June at which representatives of each Agency will\nrecommend areas for concentration based upon experiences in the \ufb01rst half of FY 1991. Areas of focus will\ninclude initiatives, training opportunities and needs, and improved use of data bases. A \ufb01nal workplan will be\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 11/17developed by October 1, 1991.\nAction Needed Timetable\nEach agency identi\ufb01es initial target areas for enforcement investigations in FY 1992 April 30, 1991\nCommunicate priority areas to regional/\ufb01eld o\ufb03ces for review/comment April 30, 1991\nOSHA-EPA meeting to discuss potential joint initiatives June 30, 1991\nFinalize MOU Workplan based on agency workplans July 30, 1991\nDevelop press strategy to highlight achievements in FY 1991 and to anounce goals for\nFY 1992September 30,\n1991\n4.

Background\nOn November 23, 1990, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA) of the United States Department of Labor and the O\ufb03ce of Enforcement of the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. The Purpose of this MOU is to improve the working relationship\nbetween the agencies in the enforcement of their respective statutes and to maximize their e\ufb00orts to ensure the\ne\ufb03cient and e\ufb00ective protection of workers, the public, and the environment at facilities subject to EPA and OSHA\njurisdiction. The MOU provides for additional agreements to carry out training and data exchange between the\nagencies. This document establishes the terms of an Agreement on Training (Agreement) to support OSHA and\nEPA enforcement activities.\nII. Purpose\nThe purpose of this Agreement is to provide the fullest possible cooperation and coordination between EPA and\nOSHA in developing and carrying out training in support of the MOU. OSHA and EPA will cooperate in developing\nand conducting periodic training programs for each other's personnel in the respective laws, regulations, and\ncompliance requirements of each agency, as appropriate, to ensure that valid referrals are made when potential\nviolations are found, and to support joint enforcement and inspection initiatives.\nIII. Target Group\nThe target group for this Agreement includes all present and future EPA and OSHA inspectors, who investigate\nworkplaces where hazards regulated by either OSHA, or EPA are likely to exist, and other appropriate personnel.\nIV. Training Focus\nEPA will support training of OSHA inspectors in recognizing environmental hazards for the purpose of making\nreferrals. Conversely, OSHA will support training of EPA inspectors in identifying workplace hazards so that they\ncan make referrals. Therefore, training of EPA and OSHA inspectors will focus on providing a general\nunderstanding of issues which are subject to the other agency's jurisdiction, signi\ufb01cant hazards regulated by the\nother agency, especially those requiring immediate remediation, and the procedures for notifying o\ufb03cials when\npotential violations come to the inspector's attention. After receiving instruction in the appropriate EPA and OSHA\nregulations, OSHA and EPA inspectors will be able to recognize and refer to the respective authorities those\ncases where apparent hazards could pose a signi\ufb01cant danger to the workplace, public, or environment.\nV. Implementation\nA. Basic Training OSHA and EPA inspectors will receive training in the basic concepts of recognizing, evaluating,\nand controlling occupational and environmental hazards commonly found in the workplace. Each agency will\ndevelop appropriate materials on these matters for inclusion in the other agency's training program. The materials\nmay be based on training materials which already are part of each agency's inspector training program and will\nconsist of written materials as well as audio-visual modules. After both agencies have developed training\nmaterials, the materials will be exchanged and then delivered, as soon as possible, to present EPA and OSHA\ninspectors. The training materials will also be included in the basic inspector training programs required to be\ntaken by all new OSHA and EPA inspectors.\n4/17/2018 Working Relationships between OSHA and EP A | Occupational Safety and Health Administration\nhttps://www .osha.gov/laws-regs/mou/1991-02-13 13/17B. Specialized Training\n1. Cross Training When appropriate and to the extent possible, EPA and OSHA will provide for attendance at\nexisting agency training courses for inspectors of the other agency.\n2. Joint Training As OSHA and EPA identify joint enforcement and inspection initiatives under the Annual Workplan\ncalled for in the MOU, EPA and OSHA will develop training materials and as appropriate conduct joint training for\nthe inspectors who will be carrying out those initiatives.\n3. Location Specialized training will be conducted at, but is not limited to, EPA's National Enforcement Training\nInstitute, EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center, and the OSHA Training Institute.\nC. Coordination\nOSHA's responsibilities under the Agreement will be coordinated by the Director, OSHA Training Institute.

Overall the general response to the proposed rule for universal waste (UW) aerosol cans is favorable .  \nHowever, one part that some State s do not support is allowing UW handlers to puncture the aerosol \ncans received from other UW handlers.  There is general agreement that UW handlers should be able to \npuncture UW aerosol cans generated on -site, but not those received from off -site sources.  \nOne State points out there are several reasons not to support UW handlers being allowed to puncture \nand drain UW aerosol cans from off -site sources:  \n   \n\u2022 First, UW aerosol cans come in a wide variety of waste types , ranging from pesticides, paints , \nsolven ts and cleaners, to freons, foamers  and acids.  There is added concern when can contents \nare unknown due to missing labels.  UW handlers would be allowed to accept thousands of spent \naerosol cans as UW and store these wastes for an extremely long time (up to  a year).  UW \nhandlers may not be set up or permitted for addressing such a wide variety of waste types for \nworker safety, environmental protection, contingencies, waste compatibility issues, etc.  The \nappropriate UW \u201cperson\u201d to puncture and drain UW aeros ol cans from off -site sources should \nbe restricted to a UW destination facility.  The final preamble or regulations should also place \nfurther limits on types of cans allowed to be punctured, such as corrosive cleaners, P -listed \nacutely hazardous wastes and  others listed in the preamble.  \n \n\u2022 Second, although the manufacturer of aerosol can puncturing and draining devices will have \noperating instructions, it has been the State\u2019s experience with UW fluorescent bulb crushers \nthat those procedures and suggested mai ntenance schedules are not always followed.  The \nmanufacturer has no control over the users of their devices, such as how those devices are \nmaintained and how the instructions are followed.  EPA stated in the proposed rule that one \nunit they investigated h ad a design capacity for 600 -750 cans before breakthrough of the \nfiltering system occurred, however, that device only processed 187 cans before breakthrough \nactually did occur, releasing volatile organics into the workplace.   \n \n\u2022 Third, it is understood by E PA that the crushing of UW fluorescent lamps is treatment (because \nit generates waste spent filters that were not associated with the original bulbs).  Likewise, \npuncturing and draining of UW aerosol cans (also generating spent filters) must be viewed as \ntreatment for consistency with the \u201cno treatment\u201d concept of UW.  Therefore, besides the \noriginal generator, only UW destination facilities should be allowed to conduct puncturing and \ndraining of UW aerosol cans.  The UW rules for lamps places emphasis on ac cumulation and the \nneed for preventing breakage of UW lamps (thus causing release of its contents) by UW \nhandlers.  The same consideration should be applied to puncturing and draining of aerosol cans \nby UW handlers.  As worded, the proposed rule will creat e and allow for situations where UW \nhandlers could act similarly to UW destination facilities.  \n \nThis State continues by recommending UW handlers be prohibited from puncturing and draining UW \naerosol cans they accept from other UW handlers.  This will help  protect worker safety and prevent \nPage 3 of 14 \n environmental contamination at the UW handler facility.  Today, generators can and do puncture and \ndrain the aerosol cans they generate on -site without the need for a UW rule.  The waste streams \ngenerated from that activit y are scrap metal, hazardous waste contents, and the generation of spent \nfilters as a new waste stream.  The proposed rule should emphasize that only destination facilities may \npuncture and drain UW aerosol cans received from off -site.  This does not restr ict the original generator \nfrom puncturing and draining the aerosol cans they generated on -site.   As UW handlers, those \ngenerators will still be able to accumulate UW aerosol cans received from off -site sources and send on \nto another UW handler or UW destin ation facility.  \n2. Another State offered that generators be allowed to puncture and drain, but not commercial processors, \nbecause the generator has more information about the hazards/contents of the can.  This commenter \nalso suggested that puncturing and drain ing be limited to large quantity handlers of universal waste \n(LQHUW) because they have notification and tracking requirements that small quantity handlers of \nuniversal waste (SQHUW) do not have.  \n3. A third State offered that while  the types of hazardous waste  generated during the processing of other \ntypes of universal waste is consistent and well known, the types of hazardous wastes generated from \naerosol can puncturing are more variable.  Such wastes could include a variety of characteristic wastes, \nlisted wast es, or any combination thereof.  The State is concerned UW handlers that receive aerosol \ncans from other generators may not be able to properly perform an adequate waste determination on \nthe hazardous wastes subsequently generated, resulting in  a greater risk of mismanagement.  \n4. Currently, destination facilities that recycle universal waste and that do not store that universal waste \nprior to recycling in accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2) may be exempt from permitting under existing \nfederal regula tions.  EPA should provide guidance on the period of time that a destination facility may \nstage UW aerosol cans before a RCRA storage permit would be federally required.  \n5. One State suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, EPA provide a clarificatio n that the RCRA \nSubpart AA/BB/CC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol \ncans.  \nThat State continues that it understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is \nalso a large quantity generato r of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements \nfor volatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers (not including satellite accumulation \nunits).  However, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40  CFR parts 262 through \n270 of this chapter if managed in accordance with 40 CFR part 273.  Therefore, since the puncturing of \naerosol cans is an activity proposed to be allowed under the universal waste rules, air emissions \ngenerated from the puncturing uni t are not regulated under the hazardous waste program.  Air emission \nrequirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable.  \n6. One State has expressed general opposition to the UW designation.  The State notes that the aerosol \ncan could be reactive  if there is propellant left, so general conditions of the UW program (storage for \nover a year by movement from handler to handler) may not be appropriate.  \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 14 \n Responses to Specific Requests for Comments  \n7. Page 11655, 3rd column, last paragraph.  The preamble sta tes: \u201cNote that the expected cost savings is \nbased on the assumption that all eligible states would adopt regulatory changes, once they are \nfinalized. EPA requests comment on this assumption.\u201d  \n\u2022 The section references the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), which was provided in the docket \nfor the proposed rule.  According to the RIA, it is assumed that the liquids from aerosol can \npuncturing will be disposed of via incineration at a cost of $4,573.11 per ton.  It might be prudent \nto consider that this cost f or disposal may increase the likelihood of abandonment of the waste \nby those who would puncture and drain aerosol cans, thus affecting the calculation of costs and \nbenefits of this action.  \n\u2022 Given that the rule is optional, it is unlikely that all eligible States will adopt it.  Perhaps EPA \nshould determine the percentage of States that have adopted other optional universal waste \nregulations to get a better estimate of the economic impact of the proposed rule.  \n\u2022 Such action takes time, and since the rule is les s stringent, it may be unrealistic to assume that \nit would be adopted by every eligible State.  \n8. Page 11656, 1st column, 3rd full paragraph.  The section of the preamble includes a description of a \ntypical  [emphasis added] aerosol can.  However, the descripti on does not limit the size of the container \nto a handheld device.  To prevent the inclusion of larger devices (e.g., compressed gas cylinders and \npropane cylinders as described on page 11660 of the proposed rule), it is suggested that the definition \nlimit the size of the cans to handheld devices only.  As an alternative, the definition could include a \nvolume limit like Utah\u2019s 24 -ounce limit as described on Page 11660 of the proposed rule.  \n9. Page 11656, 1st column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHowever,  when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting increase in internal pressure \ncan reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its \ncontents. At the point of burst ing, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and \npressure far above ambient environmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and \nbe forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as a resul t of over -\nheating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents of the can may readily catch fire as \nthey are released and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) \nthe bottom of the can may detach as  a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing \nthe upper part of the can to become a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it bursts, releasing \nmetal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state if this scenario meets the definition of reactivity and aerosol cans should \ntherefore be considered reactive under normal conditions or only when mismanaged.  This \nquestion has been debated by regulators and the regulated community at length and a clear \nEPA position would help generators and handlers make accura te and consistent waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 More specific safety measures should be included in the rule to prevent the types of reactions \ndescribed in the preamble (e.g. , not storing in excessive heat or with other materials that may \ncause a reaction).  \nPage 5 of 14 \n \u2022 This section also describes the results of mismanaging aerosol cans, particularly when they are \nexposed to excessive heat.  Given the particularly high risk of the cans bursting when exposed \nto heat, it is recommended that language, such as that found in \u00a7 262.17 (a)(1)(vi)(B), be added \nto \u00a7 273.13(e) and  \u00a7 273.33(e) to clearly address this issue for small and large quantity handlers \nof aerosol cans, regardless of whether they choose to puncture and drain.  \n10. Page 11656, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: Ha zardous waste aerosol cans that \ncontain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of (the) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance with instructions on the label. In general, the statement \non aerosol pesticid e product FIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of cans. \u201d (emphasis added) That \nsection of the preamble goes on to discuss a 2004 EPA determination \u201c\u2026that puncturing aerosol \npesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore law ful pursuant to \nFIFRA\u2026 provided certain conditions are met\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 While EPA has determined that puncturing of aerosol pesticide containers is lawful, it should be \nexplained further in the preamble why FIFRA labels (\u201cin general\u201d) state that puncturing is \nprohib ited.  \n\u2022 Since there is also a universal waste category for waste pesticide s, EPA should address if a \nhandler can manage that waste under the less stringent provisions of the aerosol can \nrequirements or if they must meet the provisions for both waste pesticides and aerosol cans.  \n11. Page 11658, 2nd column, end of 1st paragraph. The preamble states:  A summary of how the criteria in \n40 CFR 273.81 apply to aerosol cans is described below. EPA solicits comment on this analysis.  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 4th para graph. The preamble states: 5. Risks Posed by the Waste During \nAccumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to the Risks Posed by Other \nHazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards Would Be Protective of Human Health and the \nEnvironme nt During Accumulation and Transport (40 CFR 273.81(e))  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 5th paragraph, second sentence. The preamble goes on to state: \u201cAs long as \nthey remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol cans would present a lower \nrisk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained as -generated under normal \nmanagement conditions. In addition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is \naddressed by standards set by the Department of Transport ation, Office of Safety and Health \nAdministration, and local fire codes. These standards include requirements for outer packaging and \ncan design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas and general pressure conditions. Finally, \nas discussed below, the proposed management standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA \nbelieves that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the univ ersal waste \ndesignation. \u201c  \n\u2022 Beyond these standards, additional measures for shipping and accumulation designed to \nminimize potential mixing of incompatible wastes and potential for causing a reaction should be \nincluded.  While measures are proposed to preven t waste from leaving the aerosol can, some \nleakage will be inevitable.  Commenters suggest requiring separation of incompatible wastes \nrather than allowing separation.  Commenters also recommend requiring storage areas to meet \ntemperature requirements to re duce the likelihood of a strong reaction.  \nPage 6 of 14 \n \u2022 While there is agreement with having these management standards codified, additional \nlanguage is needed to clarify that after the aerosol can is punctured, it can no longer be managed \nas universal waste.  For hazar dous waste generators, management of the removed product \nand/or propellent should be presented to clarify that this subsequent management is not part \nof universal waste handling. Most small quantity gene rators ( SQGs ) and large quantity \ngenerators ( LQGs ) will only be handling their own aerosol cans and not unive rsal waste aerosols \nreceived from others.  If the intent is to allow management of aerosol cans as universal waste \non-site prior to on -site puncturing and then making determinations on the separate waste \nstreams, this should be made explicit in the rule.  \n12. Page 11660, 1st column, 2nd paragraph . The preamble states: EPA also intends this definition to be \nlimited to sealed containers whose intended use is to dispense a material by means of a propellant or \ncompressed gas. Aerosol cans are designed to contain th ose materials until they are intended for \nrelease and to present minimal risk during normal storage and transport. Other types of containers, \nincluding compressed gas canisters and propane cylinders, present a greater risk than aerosol cans \nand would not b e included.  \n\u2022 If this is the intention, it should be clearly stated in the final regulation, not just as part of the \npreamble.  The proposed definition leaves room for interpretation and the intent stated in the \npreamble to limit the definition to specific s ealed containers is therefore unenforceable.  \n13. Page 11660, 1st column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA requests comment on whether to \ninclude a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of limitations on the types of aerosol cans that \nwould be eligible for the federal universal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit \nwould be necessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment on the \nappropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the types of materials that should fall under \nit. \n\u2022 A number of States support a siz e limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit seem appropriate. \nThe 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table identifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for \neach category, specifies \u201ceach not exceeding 1 L capacity\u201d.  While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are n ot \nlarge, any size could fall within the proposed definition.  An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be purchased \nfrom home improvement stores.   \n\u2022 One State offered that it does not believe there should be a size limitation on the aerosol cans \neligible for the universal waste regulations.  \n\u2022 Commenters also strongly encourage adding language to limit applicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d \naerosol cans.  A quick internet search produces vide os of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as \nhand -pump pesticide applicators, which both meet the proposed definition.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the term \u201ccan\u201d be replaced with the term \u201ccontainer\u201d to make it clear \nthat products packaged in plastic aerosol cont ainers are eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The term \u201ccan\u201d strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the \napplicability of the definition and excludes plastic containers from being eligible to be managed \nas a universal waste.   \n \nPage 7 of 14 \n Plastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently are not as prevalent \nin the marketplace as metal aerosol containers.  Plastic aerosol container s can be used to \npackage:  \n \n\u25aa Personal care, e.g., shaving gels and foams, hair care, bo dy moisturizers  \n\u25aa Home care, e.g., air fresheners, cleaning applications, insecticides  \n\u25aa Food, e.g., oils, cooking mists, creams and sauces  \n\u25aa Industrial applications  \nIn addition, the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d needs to be clarified to exclude compressed gas \ncylinders and to include aerosol gels such as shaving cream.  \n14. Page 11660, 2nd column, 3rd paragraph. Preamble discussion about empty  aerosol cans and point of \ngeneration . \n\u2022 EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are  not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal.  This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement.  A container that meets the definition of empty is not subject \nto the hazardous waste regulations.  However, what is mi sleading about the statement is that \nthe aerosol can must be RCRA empty, per 40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal.   \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6.  Scrap metal is a \u201crecyclable material\u201d and \n\u201crecyclable material\u201d is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled.  Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to be completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P -listed waste) to \nbe classified and recycled as scrap metal.  However, it is a good management practice to remove \nas much of the waste from the aerosol can as possible.  EPA should clarify this point.  \n\u2022 Also, this rulemaking presents the opportunity for EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a RCRA empty container.  This can be accomplished by adding a provision to 40 \nCFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when it has been punctured and drained.  \nThis provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed wastes.  By declaring the \npunctured can a new point of waste generation , thus requiring the container to be evaluated to \ndetermine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container itself is a \nhazardous waste , negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste and needlessl y makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement. \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated.  \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nand send them to another handler or destination facility.  In at least one State, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash f or metal recovery.  \nEPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \u201cintact\u201d from the definition of aerosol can so that \nthe definition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or EPA can  include the term \u201cpunctured \naerosol cans\u201d in the definition.  \nPage 8 of 14 \n The liquid contents removed from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents.  The \ncontainer co ntents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste.  \n15. Page 11661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA is proposing that puncturing and \ndraining activities must be conducted by a commercial device specifically designed to sa fely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any emissions thereof.  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that to be evaluated \nby handlers and inspectors?  \n16. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has previously \ninvestigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and draining device through EPA\u2019s \nEnvironmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The ETV review demonstrated one type of \ndrum -top puncturing and draining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before \nbreakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 750 cans \nrecommended by some manufacturers. The drum that conta ined the drained liquid from the aerosol \ncans was also never more than 25% full before breakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary \nto manufacturer recommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthrough \u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated compounds (e.g., \nchlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal and gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of puncturing \nand draining devices currently available on the market, the only ways to ensure puncturing and \ndraining activities are containing emissions are to either implement an air monitoring program \nwith recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices used are equipped with \u201cend of \nlife\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is occurring.  \n17. Page 11661, second column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cTherefore, EPA is proposing that \nhandlers must establish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and  drain universal \nwaste aerosol can (including operation and maintenance of the unit; segregation of incompatible \nwastes; and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases), and ensure employees \noperating the device are trained in the prope r procedures.\u201d  \n\u2022 One State is requesting clarification in the proposed rule under \u00a7 273.13 (e)(1), which states \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and  lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d.  It is unclear if \naccumulation containers are to be \u201cclosed containers\u201d to minimize release risks as is required \nof containers for other univ ersal waste streams.   \n \n\u2022 While EPA states on page 11661 (second column, top paragraph): \u201cOperators of puncturing and \ndraining devices are also instructed to ensure that the container remains closed, \u2026,\u201d, there is no \nproposed requirement to keep containers c losed.  \n \n \nPage 9 of 14 \n 18. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The preamble states: EPA is requesting comment on \nestablishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining devices and limits on aerosol cans \nthat may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed \nrules.  \n\u2022 One State suggests adding language to clarify that once a can has been punctured, neither the \ncan nor the collected contents remain universal waste.  The State elaborates that the handler \nhas generated at leas t two distinct waste streams and must make accurate hazardous waste \ndeterminations on both.  Moreover, if the contents from different types of cans are mixed in the \nsame collection container, a more complicated determination will result.  Since the content s of \nvarious types of containers are likely to be combined, the ultimate waste determination is more \nlikely to be inaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must be conducted \nusing a commercial device, this language does not carry through to the definition.  If not \nspecifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d devices which would not have the \ninstructions, recommendations, safety testing, and testing on emissions captu re that \ncommenters believe are necessary to protect human health and the environment.  As such, \nthese commenters recommend revising the proposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct \npuncturing and draining activities using a commercially manufactured  device spec ifically \ndesigned to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any \nemissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 If the safety depends on the design of the cans to contain product, perhaps storage conditions \nneed to be product -like in some ways,  for example, noting the maximum temperature, \nindoors/under cover from rain, sun.  \n\u2022 A few States recommend requiring that a maintenance record be kept to document \nmaintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for breakthrough (that, at a \nminimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations). Those States also \nrecommend that a record be kept documenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to \ndemonstrate that incompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate  proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans \naccording to accepted engineering practices base d on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.   \n\u2022 One State suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can sate llite accumulation areas \nbe added to the rule to reduce the burden associated with tracking the universal waste storage \ntime limit for large facilities that have multiple areas where aerosol cans are generated.  In \naddition, the provision also accommodates  large facilities that have specific waste pickup \nschedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked up on an assigned day \nthroughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area.  \nThe State suggests allowing the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work area \nwhere aerosol cans are initially generated and collected.  The collection container shall not have \nPage 10 of 14 \n a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved to the \nuniversal  waste storage area.  Once in the storage are, the one -year storage time limit begins \nfor the aerosol cans.  This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection.  \nA number of aerosol can unit s crush the aerosol container after the container has been \npunctured.  The preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal \nwaste rules.  Crushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the \naeroso l cans in addition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or \ndestination facility since one 55 -gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four \ndrums of uncrushed cans.  \n19. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble sta tes: EPA is requesting comment on limiting \npuncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., a person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation).  \n\u2022 The term \u201ccommercial process ors\u201d should be defined in the final rule. Based on the \nparenthetical statement, it is not clear how one distinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from \nany handler who punctures/drains aerosol cans since most handlers are compensated for \nreceiving (and managin g) universal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 One State recommends adding language to the proposed regulations that would prohibit \n\u201ccommercial processors\u201d from puncturing universal waste aerosol cans.  In addition, that State \nrecommends that EPA define the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d within the regulations or use \nother words, such as \u201cany handler other than the original generator of the aerosol cans or the \ndestination facility\u201d to describe the prohibition.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercia l processers\u201d may be managing larger \nquantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they also are likely to be using more \nsophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than generators, and more experienced and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limi ts of that equipment.  Larger processors are also more \nlikely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans and which of those materials \nare incompatible and which materials may have an adverse impact on the seals/gaskets of \npuncturing/drain ing equipment.  \n\u2022 One State pointed out that as noted in Appendix B of the RIA, entitled \u201cPuncturing Options\u201d, \nEPA is concerned about the potential for large buildups of aerosol cans at handlers that may not \nbe properly equipped to puncture and drain such a l arge quantity of cans.  While this is a major \nconcern, another issue is whether the rule, as currently written, adequately protects against a \nsituation where a handler accepts a large quantity of cans, removes and sells the scrap metal, \nand accumulates a l arge quantity of liquid waste that must be managed as hazardous, but does \nnot properly dispose of it.  \nThe approach of limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial \nprocessors is preferred (unless permitted as a RCRA Subtitl e C hazardous waste treatment \nfacility), as it may help reduce the potential stockpiling or abandonment of large quantities of \nwaste, which increases the risk of mismanagement and/or abandonment of the waste.  \nPage 11 of 14 \n \u2022 If EPA decides not to include this provision re quiring a permit for commercial handlers, then \nlanguage should be added to ensure that any handlers receiving aerosol cans from another \nhandler segregate incompatibles to ensure that incompatible wastes are not placed in the same \ncontainer after cans are p unctured.  \n\u2022 One State supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service.  Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their fac ility and puncture and drain the cans on \nthe handler\u2019s site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper \nshredding services work.   \nIn addition, the State noted that many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial \nwaste  company to oversee and operate household hazardous waste collection centers.  Since \nthe operator is paid to oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste \nhandler of aerosol cans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and  industrial facilities. \nThis restriction results in a missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services \nwhere aerosol cans may be properly managed, treated, recycled or disposed.  \n20. Page 11662, 3rd column, Section 4 (Applicability of Land Disp osal Restriction Requirements).  \n\u2022 This section describes how Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) requirements are to be addressed for \nboth handlers and destination facilities and suggests that aerosol cans be exempt for handlers \nand transporters.  While this ap proach makes sense, the section does not explain the scenario \nwhere universal waste handlers that puncture cans will become hazardous waste generators \nand must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR Part 268.  To address this concern, \nit is sugg ested that the potential applicability of the LDR restrictions be highlighted in the final \nrule.  \nIn addition, it is suggested that the emphasis on compliance with 40 CFR Part 268 be included \nwithin the proposed regulatory language on page 11666 of the prop osed rule.  Specifically, 40 \nCFR 273.13(e)(3)(v) as proposed requires handlers to (1) conduct a hazardous waste \ndetermination and (2) manage any hazardous waste generated as a result of puncturing and \ndraining in compliance with all applicable requirements  of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272.  \nAdditionally, it is suggested that the citation include a specific reference to 40 CFR Part 268 - \nLand Disposal Restrictions.  \nSpecific Comments regarding Proposed Rule Language  \n21. Pages 11665 and 11666, \u00a7 273.6 and \u00a7 273.9.  \nThere appears to be a lack of clarity between the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d in \u00a7 273.9 and the \napplicability statement in \u00a7 273.6(b).  The definition states that an aerosol can is a container holding a \ngas under pressure and material (product) which is dispe nsed via a valve.  The applicability statement \nindicates that an \u201caerosol can\u201d is or is not a hazardous waste under certain prescribed circumstances.  It \nis our opinion that the aerosol can is a container which may or may not hold regulated hazardous waste  \nin liquid or gaseous form.   \n \n  \nPage 12 of 14 \n 22. Page 11665, \u00a7 273.6(b)(1).  \n \n\u2022 Please check grammar; change second use of the term \u201ccans\u201d to \u201ccan.\u201d  \n \n23. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(2).  \n \n\u2022 Please check this rule language for clarity.  It appears that the words \u201ccontents of the\u201d should \nappear before \u201caerosol can\u201d otherwise, only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine \nif it is a characteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can.  \n \n\u2022 One State suggests that EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clea r to the \nregulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes.  Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated, resulting in the release of the content s from the can, that the \naerosol can is a reactive hazardous waste.  However, such an occurrence does not meet the \ndefinition of a reactive hazardous waste.  Any material in a sealed container, be it a container of \nmilk or a drum of waste, will burst if o verheated.  EPA provides a good explanation of this \nphysical phenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably \nin the rule, that aerosol cans are not reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the \ncontainer actually  meet the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23.  \n \n\u2022 In addition, the definition of reactivity states \u201ca waste exhibits the characteristic of reactivity. . \n.if it is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating sou rce \nor if heated under confinement.\u201d  Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382.  It is important to \nnote that detonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions.  An explosive reaction is a \nchemical reaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a  substance occurs thereby \nreleasing hot gases which exert great pressure on the surroundings.  Detonation is also an \nexplosive reaction in which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the \nspeed of sound.  An overheated container th at bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is a physical \nphenomenon where the structural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure \nexerted by the heated contents in the container.  \n \n\u2022 Further, the definition of reactivity was \u201cintended to ident ify wastes, that because of their \nextreme instability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of \nthe waste management process \u201d, 45 FR 33109.  It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this \ntype of hazard.  A potential haza rd an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content \nis released (even during normal use) and an ignition source is present.  \n \n24. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(4).  \n \n\u2022 One State does not support EPA\u2019s proposal to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from \nbeing classified and managed as universal wastes.  That State supports that leaking or damaged \naerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal wast es.  \n  \nThe State believes that excluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste \nprogram complicates implementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the \nrule less understandable.  Also, the exclusion of leaking/damage d cans offers minimal additional \nPage 13 of 14 \n environmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules.  \n \nFurther, under that State\u2019s universal waste program, bot h leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainers and punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The State specifies that it specifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainer in its recently adopted u niversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring \nleaking or damaged aerosol containers to be overpacked with absorbent or immediately \npunctured to remove the contents of the container.  The State believes that allowing leaking, \ndamaged and punctured  aerosol containers to remain eligible to be managed as universal \nwastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal of the waste and provides for an easily \nunderstood regulatory system for aerosol containers.  \n \n25. Page 11666,  \u00a7 273.13(e)(1)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e) (1). The proposed regulations states: Universal \nwaste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the aerosol cans and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage u nder reasonably foreseeable conditions  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may contain a wide array of products, we believe the accumulation \nrequirements for SQHUWs and LQ HUWs should be revised to specify that waste aerosol cans \ncontaining incompatible materials should not  be accumulated in the same container.  \n26. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations states: A \n(small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty \npunctured aerosol cans\u2026  \n\u2022 It should  be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally available.  If recycling is not \navailable in a region, does that mean that puncturing/draining of aerosol cans is not an option \nin that region?  There needs to be further discussion of this requirement in the preamble of the \nfinal rule.  \n \nAlthough the proposed rule states (in 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3) for SQHUW) the UW handler can \npuncture \u201ctheir\u201d aerosol cans, the text is not clear that the term \u201ctheir\u201d includes UW aerosol \ncans accepted from off -site sources.  The final rule language should be clear as to whether \n\u201ctheir\u201d includes off -site sources.  \n\u2022 One State encourages EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans regardless \nwhether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not.  The cost of treatin g a drum of aerosol cans \nby incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids by energy \nrecovery.  This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly dispose of \nthe undrained cans in the normal tra sh.  Therefore, allowing the puncturing of cans even though \nthe can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection, proper management and recycling \nof the can contents.  \n \nIn addition, EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order  to allow a \nhandler to puncture aerosol cans.  Under the universal waste rules, EPA or a State has the ability \nto adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to further \nencourage the proper management, treatment and d isposal of the waste.  \nPage 14 of 14 \n 27. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii)  /Page 11667,  \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations states: \nEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) universal waste aerosol \ncan (including proper assembly, operati on and maintenance of the unit, segregation of incompatible \nwastes, and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026  \n\u2022 Not only should a written procedure be established, it is recommended to add the words \u201cand \nfollow\u201d so the revised req uirement would read: \u201cEstablish and follow  a written procedure \ndetailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 There is a further recommendation to revise this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely puncture and \nremove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensu re the capture and \ncontainment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the compatibi lity of \nthe contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining equipment.  \n28. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iii)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations states: Ensure \nthat puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires an d to prevent the release of any \ncomponent of universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the \nequipment on a solid, flat surface in a well ventilated area.  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation \u00a7 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to pu ncture aerosol cans provided \nthey \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission thereof\u201d.   This implies that all \nhazardous waste gases will be collected or captured during the activity.  If so, one State asks \nwhy puncturing equipment must be located in a well  ventilated area?  \n\u2022 Another State suggests that puncturing and draining equipment be vented outside to the \natmosphere.  \n29. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iv)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iv).  \n\u2022 Paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) an d 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) through \n273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant.  The intent of the rules can be clarified \nby deleting paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv).   \nParagraph (e)(3)(iv) requires that the content s of the aerosol cans be contained in a container \nor tank that meets the hazardous waste generator requirement regardless whether the waste \nis hazardous or not.  However, paragraph (e)(3)(vii) contradicts paragraph (e)(3)(iv) by stating \nthat if the content s of the aerosol can are nonhazardous, the handler may manage the waste in \nany manner that is in compliance with applicable rules.  \n \n \n"

Overall the general response to the proposed rule for universal waste (UW) aerosol cans is favorable .  \nHowever, one part that some State s do not support is allowing UW handlers to puncture the aerosol \ncans received from other UW handlers.  There is general agreement that UW handlers should be able to \npuncture UW aerosol cans generated on -site, but not those received from off -site sources.  \nOne State points out there are several reasons not to support UW handlers being allowed to puncture \nand drain UW aerosol cans from off -site sources:  \n   \n\u2022 First, UW aerosol cans come in a wide variety of waste types , ranging from pesticides, paints , \nsolven ts and cleaners, to freons, foamers  and acids.  There is added concern when can contents \nare unknown due to missing labels.  UW handlers would be allowed to accept thousands of spent \naerosol cans as UW and store these wastes for an extremely long time (up to  a year).  UW \nhandlers may not be set up or permitted for addressing such a wide variety of waste types for \nworker safety, environmental protection, contingencies, waste compatibility issues, etc.  The \nappropriate UW \u201cperson\u201d to puncture and drain UW aeros ol cans from off -site sources should \nbe restricted to a UW destination facility.  The final preamble or regulations should also place \nfurther limits on types of cans allowed to be punctured, such as corrosive cleaners, P -listed \nacutely hazardous wastes and  others listed in the preamble.  \n \n\u2022 Second, although the manufacturer of aerosol can puncturing and draining devices will have \noperating instructions, it has been the State\u2019s experience with UW fluorescent bulb crushers \nthat those procedures and suggested mai ntenance schedules are not always followed.  The \nmanufacturer has no control over the users of their devices, such as how those devices are \nmaintained and how the instructions are followed.  EPA stated in the proposed rule that one \nunit they investigated h ad a design capacity for 600 -750 cans before breakthrough of the \nfiltering system occurred, however, that device only processed 187 cans before breakthrough \nactually did occur, releasing volatile organics into the workplace.   \n \n\u2022 Third, it is understood by E PA that the crushing of UW fluorescent lamps is treatment (because \nit generates waste spent filters that were not associated with the original bulbs).  Likewise, \npuncturing and draining of UW aerosol cans (also generating spent filters) must be viewed as \ntreatment for consistency with the \u201cno treatment\u201d concept of UW.  Therefore, besides the \noriginal generator, only UW destination facilities should be allowed to conduct puncturing and \ndraining of UW aerosol cans.  The UW rules for lamps places emphasis on ac cumulation and the \nneed for preventing breakage of UW lamps (thus causing release of its contents) by UW \nhandlers.  The same consideration should be applied to puncturing and draining of aerosol cans \nby UW handlers.  As worded, the proposed rule will creat e and allow for situations where UW \nhandlers could act similarly to UW destination facilities.  \n \nThis State continues by recommending UW handlers be prohibited from puncturing and draining UW \naerosol cans they accept from other UW handlers.  This will help  protect worker safety and prevent \nPage 3 of 14 \n environmental contamination at the UW handler facility.  Today, generators can and do puncture and \ndrain the aerosol cans they generate on -site without the need for a UW rule.  The waste streams \ngenerated from that activit y are scrap metal, hazardous waste contents, and the generation of spent \nfilters as a new waste stream.  The proposed rule should emphasize that only destination facilities may \npuncture and drain UW aerosol cans received from off -site.  This does not restr ict the original generator \nfrom puncturing and draining the aerosol cans they generated on -site.   As UW handlers, those \ngenerators will still be able to accumulate UW aerosol cans received from off -site sources and send on \nto another UW handler or UW destin ation facility.  \n2. Another State offered that generators be allowed to puncture and drain, but not commercial processors, \nbecause the generator has more information about the hazards/contents of the can.  This commenter \nalso suggested that puncturing and drain ing be limited to large quantity handlers of universal waste \n(LQHUW) because they have notification and tracking requirements that small quantity handlers of \nuniversal waste (SQHUW) do not have.  \n3. A third State offered that while  the types of hazardous waste  generated during the processing of other \ntypes of universal waste is consistent and well known, the types of hazardous wastes generated from \naerosol can puncturing are more variable.  Such wastes could include a variety of characteristic wastes, \nlisted wast es, or any combination thereof.  The State is concerned UW handlers that receive aerosol \ncans from other generators may not be able to properly perform an adequate waste determination on \nthe hazardous wastes subsequently generated, resulting in  a greater risk of mismanagement.  \n4. Currently, destination facilities that recycle universal waste and that do not store that universal waste \nprior to recycling in accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2) may be exempt from permitting under existing \nfederal regula tions.  EPA should provide guidance on the period of time that a destination facility may \nstage UW aerosol cans before a RCRA storage permit would be federally required.  \n5. One State suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, EPA provide a clarificatio n that the RCRA \nSubpart AA/BB/CC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol \ncans.  \nThat State continues that it understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is \nalso a large quantity generato r of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements \nfor volatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers (not including satellite accumulation \nunits).  However, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40  CFR parts 262 through \n270 of this chapter if managed in accordance with 40 CFR part 273.  Therefore, since the puncturing of \naerosol cans is an activity proposed to be allowed under the universal waste rules, air emissions \ngenerated from the puncturing uni t are not regulated under the hazardous waste program.  Air emission \nrequirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable.  \n6. One State has expressed general opposition to the UW designation.  The State notes that the aerosol \ncan could be reactive  if there is propellant left, so general conditions of the UW program (storage for \nover a year by movement from handler to handler) may not be appropriate.  \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 14 \n Responses to Specific Requests for Comments  \n7. Page 11655, 3rd column, last paragraph.  The preamble sta tes: \u201cNote that the expected cost savings is \nbased on the assumption that all eligible states would adopt regulatory changes, once they are \nfinalized. EPA requests comment on this assumption.\u201d  \n\u2022 The section references the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), which was provided in the docket \nfor the proposed rule.  According to the RIA, it is assumed that the liquids from aerosol can \npuncturing will be disposed of via incineration at a cost of $4,573.11 per ton.  It might be prudent \nto consider that this cost f or disposal may increase the likelihood of abandonment of the waste \nby those who would puncture and drain aerosol cans, thus affecting the calculation of costs and \nbenefits of this action.  \n\u2022 Given that the rule is optional, it is unlikely that all eligible States will adopt it.  Perhaps EPA \nshould determine the percentage of States that have adopted other optional universal waste \nregulations to get a better estimate of the economic impact of the proposed rule.  \n\u2022 Such action takes time, and since the rule is les s stringent, it may be unrealistic to assume that \nit would be adopted by every eligible State.  \n8. Page 11656, 1st column, 3rd full paragraph.  The section of the preamble includes a description of a \ntypical  [emphasis added] aerosol can.  However, the descripti on does not limit the size of the container \nto a handheld device.  To prevent the inclusion of larger devices (e.g., compressed gas cylinders and \npropane cylinders as described on page 11660 of the proposed rule), it is suggested that the definition \nlimit the size of the cans to handheld devices only.  As an alternative, the definition could include a \nvolume limit like Utah\u2019s 24 -ounce limit as described on Page 11660 of the proposed rule.  \n9. Page 11656, 1st column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHowever,  when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting increase in internal pressure \ncan reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its \ncontents. At the point of burst ing, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and \npressure far above ambient environmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and \nbe forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as a resul t of over -\nheating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents of the can may readily catch fire as \nthey are released and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) \nthe bottom of the can may detach as  a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing \nthe upper part of the can to become a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it bursts, releasing \nmetal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state if this scenario meets the definition of reactivity and aerosol cans should \ntherefore be considered reactive under normal conditions or only when mismanaged.  This \nquestion has been debated by regulators and the regulated community at length and a clear \nEPA position would help generators and handlers make accura te and consistent waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 More specific safety measures should be included in the rule to prevent the types of reactions \ndescribed in the preamble (e.g. , not storing in excessive heat or with other materials that may \ncause a reaction).  \nPage 5 of 14 \n \u2022 This section also describes the results of mismanaging aerosol cans, particularly when they are \nexposed to excessive heat.  Given the particularly high risk of the cans bursting when exposed \nto heat, it is recommended that language, such as that found in \u00a7 262.17 (a)(1)(vi)(B), be added \nto \u00a7 273.13(e) and  \u00a7 273.33(e) to clearly address this issue for small and large quantity handlers \nof aerosol cans, regardless of whether they choose to puncture and drain.  \n10. Page 11656, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: Ha zardous waste aerosol cans that \ncontain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of (the) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance with instructions on the label. In general, the statement \non aerosol pesticid e product FIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of cans. \u201d (emphasis added) That \nsection of the preamble goes on to discuss a 2004 EPA determination \u201c\u2026that puncturing aerosol \npesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore law ful pursuant to \nFIFRA\u2026 provided certain conditions are met\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 While EPA has determined that puncturing of aerosol pesticide containers is lawful, it should be \nexplained further in the preamble why FIFRA labels (\u201cin general\u201d) state that puncturing is \nprohib ited.  \n\u2022 Since there is also a universal waste category for waste pesticide s, EPA should address if a \nhandler can manage that waste under the less stringent provisions of the aerosol can \nrequirements or if they must meet the provisions for both waste pesticides and aerosol cans.  \n11. Page 11658, 2nd column, end of 1st paragraph. The preamble states:  A summary of how the criteria in \n40 CFR 273.81 apply to aerosol cans is described below. EPA solicits comment on this analysis.  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 4th para graph. The preamble states: 5. Risks Posed by the Waste During \nAccumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to the Risks Posed by Other \nHazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards Would Be Protective of Human Health and the \nEnvironme nt During Accumulation and Transport (40 CFR 273.81(e))  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 5th paragraph, second sentence. The preamble goes on to state: \u201cAs long as \nthey remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol cans would present a lower \nrisk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained as -generated under normal \nmanagement conditions. In addition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is \naddressed by standards set by the Department of Transport ation, Office of Safety and Health \nAdministration, and local fire codes. These standards include requirements for outer packaging and \ncan design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas and general pressure conditions. Finally, \nas discussed below, the proposed management standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA \nbelieves that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the univ ersal waste \ndesignation. \u201c  \n\u2022 Beyond these standards, additional measures for shipping and accumulation designed to \nminimize potential mixing of incompatible wastes and potential for causing a reaction should be \nincluded.  While measures are proposed to preven t waste from leaving the aerosol can, some \nleakage will be inevitable.  Commenters suggest requiring separation of incompatible wastes \nrather than allowing separation.  Commenters also recommend requiring storage areas to meet \ntemperature requirements to re duce the likelihood of a strong reaction.  \nPage 6 of 14 \n \u2022 While there is agreement with having these management standards codified, additional \nlanguage is needed to clarify that after the aerosol can is punctured, it can no longer be managed \nas universal waste.  For hazar dous waste generators, management of the removed product \nand/or propellent should be presented to clarify that this subsequent management is not part \nof universal waste handling. Most small quantity gene rators ( SQGs ) and large quantity \ngenerators ( LQGs ) will only be handling their own aerosol cans and not unive rsal waste aerosols \nreceived from others.  If the intent is to allow management of aerosol cans as universal waste \non-site prior to on -site puncturing and then making determinations on the separate waste \nstreams, this should be made explicit in the rule.  \n12. Page 11660, 1st column, 2nd paragraph . The preamble states: EPA also intends this definition to be \nlimited to sealed containers whose intended use is to dispense a material by means of a propellant or \ncompressed gas. Aerosol cans are designed to contain th ose materials until they are intended for \nrelease and to present minimal risk during normal storage and transport. Other types of containers, \nincluding compressed gas canisters and propane cylinders, present a greater risk than aerosol cans \nand would not b e included.  \n\u2022 If this is the intention, it should be clearly stated in the final regulation, not just as part of the \npreamble.  The proposed definition leaves room for interpretation and the intent stated in the \npreamble to limit the definition to specific s ealed containers is therefore unenforceable.  \n13. Page 11660, 1st column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA requests comment on whether to \ninclude a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of limitations on the types of aerosol cans that \nwould be eligible for the federal universal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit \nwould be necessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment on the \nappropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the types of materials that should fall under \nit. \n\u2022 A number of States support a siz e limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit seem appropriate. \nThe 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table identifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for \neach category, specifies \u201ceach not exceeding 1 L capacity\u201d.  While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are n ot \nlarge, any size could fall within the proposed definition.  An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be purchased \nfrom home improvement stores.   \n\u2022 One State offered that it does not believe there should be a size limitation on the aerosol cans \neligible for the universal waste regulations.  \n\u2022 Commenters also strongly encourage adding language to limit applicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d \naerosol cans.  A quick internet search produces vide os of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as \nhand -pump pesticide applicators, which both meet the proposed definition.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the term \u201ccan\u201d be replaced with the term \u201ccontainer\u201d to make it clear \nthat products packaged in plastic aerosol cont ainers are eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The term \u201ccan\u201d strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the \napplicability of the definition and excludes plastic containers from being eligible to be managed \nas a universal waste.   \n \nPage 7 of 14 \n Plastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently are not as prevalent \nin the marketplace as metal aerosol containers.  Plastic aerosol container s can be used to \npackage:  \n \n\u25aa Personal care, e.g., shaving gels and foams, hair care, bo dy moisturizers  \n\u25aa Home care, e.g., air fresheners, cleaning applications, insecticides  \n\u25aa Food, e.g., oils, cooking mists, creams and sauces  \n\u25aa Industrial applications  \nIn addition, the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d needs to be clarified to exclude compressed gas \ncylinders and to include aerosol gels such as shaving cream.  \n14. Page 11660, 2nd column, 3rd paragraph. Preamble discussion about empty  aerosol cans and point of \ngeneration . \n\u2022 EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are  not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal.  This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement.  A container that meets the definition of empty is not subject \nto the hazardous waste regulations.  However, what is mi sleading about the statement is that \nthe aerosol can must be RCRA empty, per 40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal.   \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6.  Scrap metal is a \u201crecyclable material\u201d and \n\u201crecyclable material\u201d is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled.  Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to be completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P -listed waste) to \nbe classified and recycled as scrap metal.  However, it is a good management practice to remove \nas much of the waste from the aerosol can as possible.  EPA should clarify this point.  \n\u2022 Also, this rulemaking presents the opportunity for EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a RCRA empty container.  This can be accomplished by adding a provision to 40 \nCFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when it has been punctured and drained.  \nThis provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed wastes.  By declaring the \npunctured can a new point of waste generation , thus requiring the container to be evaluated to \ndetermine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container itself is a \nhazardous waste , negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste and needlessl y makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement. \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated.  \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nand send them to another handler or destination facility.  In at least one State, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash f or metal recovery.  \nEPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \u201cintact\u201d from the definition of aerosol can so that \nthe definition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or EPA can  include the term \u201cpunctured \naerosol cans\u201d in the definition.  \nPage 8 of 14 \n The liquid contents removed from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents.  The \ncontainer co ntents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste.  \n15. Page 11661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA is proposing that puncturing and \ndraining activities must be conducted by a commercial device specifically designed to sa fely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any emissions thereof.  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that to be evaluated \nby handlers and inspectors?  \n16. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has previously \ninvestigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and draining device through EPA\u2019s \nEnvironmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The ETV review demonstrated one type of \ndrum -top puncturing and draining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before \nbreakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 750 cans \nrecommended by some manufacturers. The drum that conta ined the drained liquid from the aerosol \ncans was also never more than 25% full before breakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary \nto manufacturer recommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthrough \u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated compounds (e.g., \nchlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal and gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of puncturing \nand draining devices currently available on the market, the only ways to ensure puncturing and \ndraining activities are containing emissions are to either implement an air monitoring program \nwith recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices used are equipped with \u201cend of \nlife\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is occurring.  \n17. Page 11661, second column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cTherefore, EPA is proposing that \nhandlers must establish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and  drain universal \nwaste aerosol can (including operation and maintenance of the unit; segregation of incompatible \nwastes; and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases), and ensure employees \noperating the device are trained in the prope r procedures.\u201d  \n\u2022 One State is requesting clarification in the proposed rule under \u00a7 273.13 (e)(1), which states \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and  lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d.  It is unclear if \naccumulation containers are to be \u201cclosed containers\u201d to minimize release risks as is required \nof containers for other univ ersal waste streams.   \n \n\u2022 While EPA states on page 11661 (second column, top paragraph): \u201cOperators of puncturing and \ndraining devices are also instructed to ensure that the container remains closed, \u2026,\u201d, there is no \nproposed requirement to keep containers c losed.  \n \n \nPage 9 of 14 \n 18. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The preamble states: EPA is requesting comment on \nestablishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining devices and limits on aerosol cans \nthat may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed \nrules.  \n\u2022 One State suggests adding language to clarify that once a can has been punctured, neither the \ncan nor the collected contents remain universal waste.  The State elaborates that the handler \nhas generated at leas t two distinct waste streams and must make accurate hazardous waste \ndeterminations on both.  Moreover, if the contents from different types of cans are mixed in the \nsame collection container, a more complicated determination will result.  Since the content s of \nvarious types of containers are likely to be combined, the ultimate waste determination is more \nlikely to be inaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must be conducted \nusing a commercial device, this language does not carry through to the definition.  If not \nspecifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d devices which would not have the \ninstructions, recommendations, safety testing, and testing on emissions captu re that \ncommenters believe are necessary to protect human health and the environment.  As such, \nthese commenters recommend revising the proposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct \npuncturing and draining activities using a commercially manufactured  device spec ifically \ndesigned to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any \nemissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 If the safety depends on the design of the cans to contain product, perhaps storage conditions \nneed to be product -like in some ways,  for example, noting the maximum temperature, \nindoors/under cover from rain, sun.  \n\u2022 A few States recommend requiring that a maintenance record be kept to document \nmaintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for breakthrough (that, at a \nminimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations). Those States also \nrecommend that a record be kept documenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to \ndemonstrate that incompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate  proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans \naccording to accepted engineering practices base d on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.   \n\u2022 One State suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can sate llite accumulation areas \nbe added to the rule to reduce the burden associated with tracking the universal waste storage \ntime limit for large facilities that have multiple areas where aerosol cans are generated.  In \naddition, the provision also accommodates  large facilities that have specific waste pickup \nschedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked up on an assigned day \nthroughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area.  \nThe State suggests allowing the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work area \nwhere aerosol cans are initially generated and collected.  The collection container shall not have \nPage 10 of 14 \n a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved to the \nuniversal  waste storage area.  Once in the storage are, the one -year storage time limit begins \nfor the aerosol cans.  This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection.  \nA number of aerosol can unit s crush the aerosol container after the container has been \npunctured.  The preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal \nwaste rules.  Crushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the \naeroso l cans in addition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or \ndestination facility since one 55 -gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four \ndrums of uncrushed cans.  \n19. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble sta tes: EPA is requesting comment on limiting \npuncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., a person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation).  \n\u2022 The term \u201ccommercial process ors\u201d should be defined in the final rule. Based on the \nparenthetical statement, it is not clear how one distinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from \nany handler who punctures/drains aerosol cans since most handlers are compensated for \nreceiving (and managin g) universal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 One State recommends adding language to the proposed regulations that would prohibit \n\u201ccommercial processors\u201d from puncturing universal waste aerosol cans.  In addition, that State \nrecommends that EPA define the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d within the regulations or use \nother words, such as \u201cany handler other than the original generator of the aerosol cans or the \ndestination facility\u201d to describe the prohibition.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercia l processers\u201d may be managing larger \nquantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they also are likely to be using more \nsophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than generators, and more experienced and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limi ts of that equipment.  Larger processors are also more \nlikely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans and which of those materials \nare incompatible and which materials may have an adverse impact on the seals/gaskets of \npuncturing/drain ing equipment.  \n\u2022 One State pointed out that as noted in Appendix B of the RIA, entitled \u201cPuncturing Options\u201d, \nEPA is concerned about the potential for large buildups of aerosol cans at handlers that may not \nbe properly equipped to puncture and drain such a l arge quantity of cans.  While this is a major \nconcern, another issue is whether the rule, as currently written, adequately protects against a \nsituation where a handler accepts a large quantity of cans, removes and sells the scrap metal, \nand accumulates a l arge quantity of liquid waste that must be managed as hazardous, but does \nnot properly dispose of it.  \nThe approach of limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial \nprocessors is preferred (unless permitted as a RCRA Subtitl e C hazardous waste treatment \nfacility), as it may help reduce the potential stockpiling or abandonment of large quantities of \nwaste, which increases the risk of mismanagement and/or abandonment of the waste.  \nPage 11 of 14 \n \u2022 If EPA decides not to include this provision re quiring a permit for commercial handlers, then \nlanguage should be added to ensure that any handlers receiving aerosol cans from another \nhandler segregate incompatibles to ensure that incompatible wastes are not placed in the same \ncontainer after cans are p unctured.  \n\u2022 One State supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service.  Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their fac ility and puncture and drain the cans on \nthe handler\u2019s site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper \nshredding services work.   \nIn addition, the State noted that many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial \nwaste  company to oversee and operate household hazardous waste collection centers.  Since \nthe operator is paid to oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste \nhandler of aerosol cans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and  industrial facilities. \nThis restriction results in a missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services \nwhere aerosol cans may be properly managed, treated, recycled or disposed.  \n20. Page 11662, 3rd column, Section 4 (Applicability of Land Disp osal Restriction Requirements).  \n\u2022 This section describes how Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) requirements are to be addressed for \nboth handlers and destination facilities and suggests that aerosol cans be exempt for handlers \nand transporters.  While this ap proach makes sense, the section does not explain the scenario \nwhere universal waste handlers that puncture cans will become hazardous waste generators \nand must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR Part 268.  To address this concern, \nit is sugg ested that the potential applicability of the LDR restrictions be highlighted in the final \nrule.  \nIn addition, it is suggested that the emphasis on compliance with 40 CFR Part 268 be included \nwithin the proposed regulatory language on page 11666 of the prop osed rule.  Specifically, 40 \nCFR 273.13(e)(3)(v) as proposed requires handlers to (1) conduct a hazardous waste \ndetermination and (2) manage any hazardous waste generated as a result of puncturing and \ndraining in compliance with all applicable requirements  of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272.  \nAdditionally, it is suggested that the citation include a specific reference to 40 CFR Part 268 - \nLand Disposal Restrictions.  \nSpecific Comments regarding Proposed Rule Language  \n21. Pages 11665 and 11666, \u00a7 273.6 and \u00a7 273.9.  \nThere appears to be a lack of clarity between the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d in \u00a7 273.9 and the \napplicability statement in \u00a7 273.6(b).  The definition states that an aerosol can is a container holding a \ngas under pressure and material (product) which is dispe nsed via a valve.  The applicability statement \nindicates that an \u201caerosol can\u201d is or is not a hazardous waste under certain prescribed circumstances.  It \nis our opinion that the aerosol can is a container which may or may not hold regulated hazardous waste  \nin liquid or gaseous form.   \n \n  \nPage 12 of 14 \n 22. Page 11665, \u00a7 273.6(b)(1).  \n \n\u2022 Please check grammar; change second use of the term \u201ccans\u201d to \u201ccan.\u201d  \n \n23. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(2).  \n \n\u2022 Please check this rule language for clarity.  It appears that the words \u201ccontents of the\u201d should \nappear before \u201caerosol can\u201d otherwise, only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine \nif it is a characteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can.  \n \n\u2022 One State suggests that EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clea r to the \nregulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes.  Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated, resulting in the release of the content s from the can, that the \naerosol can is a reactive hazardous waste.  However, such an occurrence does not meet the \ndefinition of a reactive hazardous waste.  Any material in a sealed container, be it a container of \nmilk or a drum of waste, will burst if o verheated.  EPA provides a good explanation of this \nphysical phenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably \nin the rule, that aerosol cans are not reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the \ncontainer actually  meet the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23.  \n \n\u2022 In addition, the definition of reactivity states \u201ca waste exhibits the characteristic of reactivity. . \n.if it is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating sou rce \nor if heated under confinement.\u201d  Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382.  It is important to \nnote that detonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions.  An explosive reaction is a \nchemical reaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a  substance occurs thereby \nreleasing hot gases which exert great pressure on the surroundings.  Detonation is also an \nexplosive reaction in which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the \nspeed of sound.  An overheated container th at bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is a physical \nphenomenon where the structural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure \nexerted by the heated contents in the container.  \n \n\u2022 Further, the definition of reactivity was \u201cintended to ident ify wastes, that because of their \nextreme instability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of \nthe waste management process \u201d, 45 FR 33109.  It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this \ntype of hazard.  A potential haza rd an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content \nis released (even during normal use) and an ignition source is present.  \n \n24. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(4).  \n \n\u2022 One State does not support EPA\u2019s proposal to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from \nbeing classified and managed as universal wastes.  That State supports that leaking or damaged \naerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal wast es.  \n  \nThe State believes that excluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste \nprogram complicates implementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the \nrule less understandable.  Also, the exclusion of leaking/damage d cans offers minimal additional \nPage 13 of 14 \n environmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules.  \n \nFurther, under that State\u2019s universal waste program, bot h leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainers and punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The State specifies that it specifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainer in its recently adopted u niversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring \nleaking or damaged aerosol containers to be overpacked with absorbent or immediately \npunctured to remove the contents of the container.  The State believes that allowing leaking, \ndamaged and punctured  aerosol containers to remain eligible to be managed as universal \nwastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal of the waste and provides for an easily \nunderstood regulatory system for aerosol containers.  \n \n25. Page 11666,  \u00a7 273.13(e)(1)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e) (1). The proposed regulations states: Universal \nwaste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the aerosol cans and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage u nder reasonably foreseeable conditions  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may contain a wide array of products, we believe the accumulation \nrequirements for SQHUWs and LQ HUWs should be revised to specify that waste aerosol cans \ncontaining incompatible materials should not  be accumulated in the same container.  \n26. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations states: A \n(small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty \npunctured aerosol cans\u2026  \n\u2022 It should  be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally available.  If recycling is not \navailable in a region, does that mean that puncturing/draining of aerosol cans is not an option \nin that region?  There needs to be further discussion of this requirement in the preamble of the \nfinal rule.  \n \nAlthough the proposed rule states (in 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3) for SQHUW) the UW handler can \npuncture \u201ctheir\u201d aerosol cans, the text is not clear that the term \u201ctheir\u201d includes UW aerosol \ncans accepted from off -site sources.  The final rule language should be clear as to whether \n\u201ctheir\u201d includes off -site sources.  \n\u2022 One State encourages EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans regardless \nwhether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not.  The cost of treatin g a drum of aerosol cans \nby incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids by energy \nrecovery.  This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly dispose of \nthe undrained cans in the normal tra sh.  Therefore, allowing the puncturing of cans even though \nthe can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection, proper management and recycling \nof the can contents.  \n \nIn addition, EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order  to allow a \nhandler to puncture aerosol cans.  Under the universal waste rules, EPA or a State has the ability \nto adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to further \nencourage the proper management, treatment and d isposal of the waste.  \nPage 14 of 14 \n 27. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii)  /Page 11667,  \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations states: \nEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) universal waste aerosol \ncan (including proper assembly, operati on and maintenance of the unit, segregation of incompatible \nwastes, and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026  \n\u2022 Not only should a written procedure be established, it is recommended to add the words \u201cand \nfollow\u201d so the revised req uirement would read: \u201cEstablish and follow  a written procedure \ndetailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 There is a further recommendation to revise this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely puncture and \nremove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensu re the capture and \ncontainment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the compatibi lity of \nthe contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining equipment.  \n28. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iii)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations states: Ensure \nthat puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires an d to prevent the release of any \ncomponent of universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the \nequipment on a solid, flat surface in a well ventilated area.  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation \u00a7 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to pu ncture aerosol cans provided \nthey \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission thereof\u201d.   This implies that all \nhazardous waste gases will be collected or captured during the activity.  If so, one State asks \nwhy puncturing equipment must be located in a well  ventilated area?  \n\u2022 Another State suggests that puncturing and draining equipment be vented outside to the \natmosphere.  \n29. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iv)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iv).  \n\u2022 Paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) an d 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) through \n273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant.

Overall the general response to the proposed rule for universal waste (UW) aerosol cans is favorable .  \nHowever, one part that some State s do not support is allowing UW handlers to puncture the aerosol \ncans received from other UW handlers.  There is general agreement that UW handlers should be able to \npuncture UW aerosol cans generated on -site, but not those received from off -site sources.  \nOne State points out there are several reasons not to support UW handlers being allowed to puncture \nand drain UW aerosol cans from off -site sources:  \n   \n\u2022 First, UW aerosol cans come in a wide variety of waste types , ranging from pesticides, paints , \nsolven ts and cleaners, to freons, foamers  and acids.  There is added concern when can contents \nare unknown due to missing labels.  UW handlers would be allowed to accept thousands of spent \naerosol cans as UW and store these wastes for an extremely long time (up to  a year).  UW \nhandlers may not be set up or permitted for addressing such a wide variety of waste types for \nworker safety, environmental protection, contingencies, waste compatibility issues, etc.  The \nappropriate UW \u201cperson\u201d to puncture and drain UW aeros ol cans from off -site sources should \nbe restricted to a UW destination facility.  The final preamble or regulations should also place \nfurther limits on types of cans allowed to be punctured, such as corrosive cleaners, P -listed \nacutely hazardous wastes and  others listed in the preamble.  \n \n\u2022 Second, although the manufacturer of aerosol can puncturing and draining devices will have \noperating instructions, it has been the State\u2019s experience with UW fluorescent bulb crushers \nthat those procedures and suggested mai ntenance schedules are not always followed.  The \nmanufacturer has no control over the users of their devices, such as how those devices are \nmaintained and how the instructions are followed.  EPA stated in the proposed rule that one \nunit they investigated h ad a design capacity for 600 -750 cans before breakthrough of the \nfiltering system occurred, however, that device only processed 187 cans before breakthrough \nactually did occur, releasing volatile organics into the workplace.   \n \n\u2022 Third, it is understood by E PA that the crushing of UW fluorescent lamps is treatment (because \nit generates waste spent filters that were not associated with the original bulbs).  Likewise, \npuncturing and draining of UW aerosol cans (also generating spent filters) must be viewed as \ntreatment for consistency with the \u201cno treatment\u201d concept of UW.  Therefore, besides the \noriginal generator, only UW destination facilities should be allowed to conduct puncturing and \ndraining of UW aerosol cans.  The UW rules for lamps places emphasis on ac cumulation and the \nneed for preventing breakage of UW lamps (thus causing release of its contents) by UW \nhandlers.  The same consideration should be applied to puncturing and draining of aerosol cans \nby UW handlers.  As worded, the proposed rule will creat e and allow for situations where UW \nhandlers could act similarly to UW destination facilities.  \n \nThis State continues by recommending UW handlers be prohibited from puncturing and draining UW \naerosol cans they accept from other UW handlers.  This will help  protect worker safety and prevent \nPage 3 of 14 \n environmental contamination at the UW handler facility.  Today, generators can and do puncture and \ndrain the aerosol cans they generate on -site without the need for a UW rule.  The waste streams \ngenerated from that activit y are scrap metal, hazardous waste contents, and the generation of spent \nfilters as a new waste stream.  The proposed rule should emphasize that only destination facilities may \npuncture and drain UW aerosol cans received from off -site.  This does not restr ict the original generator \nfrom puncturing and draining the aerosol cans they generated on -site.   As UW handlers, those \ngenerators will still be able to accumulate UW aerosol cans received from off -site sources and send on \nto another UW handler or UW destin ation facility.  \n2. Another State offered that generators be allowed to puncture and drain, but not commercial processors, \nbecause the generator has more information about the hazards/contents of the can.  This commenter \nalso suggested that puncturing and drain ing be limited to large quantity handlers of universal waste \n(LQHUW) because they have notification and tracking requirements that small quantity handlers of \nuniversal waste (SQHUW) do not have.  \n3. A third State offered that while  the types of hazardous waste  generated during the processing of other \ntypes of universal waste is consistent and well known, the types of hazardous wastes generated from \naerosol can puncturing are more variable.  Such wastes could include a variety of characteristic wastes, \nlisted wast es, or any combination thereof.  The State is concerned UW handlers that receive aerosol \ncans from other generators may not be able to properly perform an adequate waste determination on \nthe hazardous wastes subsequently generated, resulting in  a greater risk of mismanagement.  \n4. Currently, destination facilities that recycle universal waste and that do not store that universal waste \nprior to recycling in accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2) may be exempt from permitting under existing \nfederal regula tions.  EPA should provide guidance on the period of time that a destination facility may \nstage UW aerosol cans before a RCRA storage permit would be federally required.  \n5. One State suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, EPA provide a clarificatio n that the RCRA \nSubpart AA/BB/CC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol \ncans.  \nThat State continues that it understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is \nalso a large quantity generato r of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements \nfor volatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers (not including satellite accumulation \nunits).  However, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40  CFR parts 262 through \n270 of this chapter if managed in accordance with 40 CFR part 273.  Therefore, since the puncturing of \naerosol cans is an activity proposed to be allowed under the universal waste rules, air emissions \ngenerated from the puncturing uni t are not regulated under the hazardous waste program.  Air emission \nrequirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable.  \n6. One State has expressed general opposition to the UW designation.  The State notes that the aerosol \ncan could be reactive  if there is propellant left, so general conditions of the UW program (storage for \nover a year by movement from handler to handler) may not be appropriate.  \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 14 \n Responses to Specific Requests for Comments  \n7. Page 11655, 3rd column, last paragraph.  The preamble sta tes: \u201cNote that the expected cost savings is \nbased on the assumption that all eligible states would adopt regulatory changes, once they are \nfinalized. EPA requests comment on this assumption.\u201d  \n\u2022 The section references the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), which was provided in the docket \nfor the proposed rule.  According to the RIA, it is assumed that the liquids from aerosol can \npuncturing will be disposed of via incineration at a cost of $4,573.11 per ton.  It might be prudent \nto consider that this cost f or disposal may increase the likelihood of abandonment of the waste \nby those who would puncture and drain aerosol cans, thus affecting the calculation of costs and \nbenefits of this action.  \n\u2022 Given that the rule is optional, it is unlikely that all eligible States will adopt it.  Perhaps EPA \nshould determine the percentage of States that have adopted other optional universal waste \nregulations to get a better estimate of the economic impact of the proposed rule.  \n\u2022 Such action takes time, and since the rule is les s stringent, it may be unrealistic to assume that \nit would be adopted by every eligible State.  \n8. Page 11656, 1st column, 3rd full paragraph.  The section of the preamble includes a description of a \ntypical  [emphasis added] aerosol can.  However, the descripti on does not limit the size of the container \nto a handheld device.  To prevent the inclusion of larger devices (e.g., compressed gas cylinders and \npropane cylinders as described on page 11660 of the proposed rule), it is suggested that the definition \nlimit the size of the cans to handheld devices only.  As an alternative, the definition could include a \nvolume limit like Utah\u2019s 24 -ounce limit as described on Page 11660 of the proposed rule.  \n9. Page 11656, 1st column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHowever,  when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting increase in internal pressure \ncan reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its \ncontents. At the point of burst ing, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and \npressure far above ambient environmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and \nbe forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as a resul t of over -\nheating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents of the can may readily catch fire as \nthey are released and exposed to atmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) \nthe bottom of the can may detach as  a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing \nthe upper part of the can to become a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it bursts, releasing \nmetal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state if this scenario meets the definition of reactivity and aerosol cans should \ntherefore be considered reactive under normal conditions or only when mismanaged.  This \nquestion has been debated by regulators and the regulated community at length and a clear \nEPA position would help generators and handlers make accura te and consistent waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 More specific safety measures should be included in the rule to prevent the types of reactions \ndescribed in the preamble (e.g. , not storing in excessive heat or with other materials that may \ncause a reaction).  \nPage 5 of 14 \n \u2022 This section also describes the results of mismanaging aerosol cans, particularly when they are \nexposed to excessive heat.  Given the particularly high risk of the cans bursting when exposed \nto heat, it is recommended that language, such as that found in \u00a7 262.17 (a)(1)(vi)(B), be added \nto \u00a7 273.13(e) and  \u00a7 273.33(e) to clearly address this issue for small and large quantity handlers \nof aerosol cans, regardless of whether they choose to puncture and drain.  \n10. Page 11656, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: Ha zardous waste aerosol cans that \ncontain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of (the) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance with instructions on the label. In general, the statement \non aerosol pesticid e product FIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of cans. \u201d (emphasis added) That \nsection of the preamble goes on to discuss a 2004 EPA determination \u201c\u2026that puncturing aerosol \npesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore law ful pursuant to \nFIFRA\u2026 provided certain conditions are met\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 While EPA has determined that puncturing of aerosol pesticide containers is lawful, it should be \nexplained further in the preamble why FIFRA labels (\u201cin general\u201d) state that puncturing is \nprohib ited.  \n\u2022 Since there is also a universal waste category for waste pesticide s, EPA should address if a \nhandler can manage that waste under the less stringent provisions of the aerosol can \nrequirements or if they must meet the provisions for both waste pesticides and aerosol cans.  \n11. Page 11658, 2nd column, end of 1st paragraph. The preamble states:  A summary of how the criteria in \n40 CFR 273.81 apply to aerosol cans is described below. EPA solicits comment on this analysis.  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 4th para graph. The preamble states: 5. Risks Posed by the Waste During \nAccumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to the Risks Posed by Other \nHazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards Would Be Protective of Human Health and the \nEnvironme nt During Accumulation and Transport (40 CFR 273.81(e))  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 5th paragraph, second sentence. The preamble goes on to state: \u201cAs long as \nthey remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol cans would present a lower \nrisk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained as -generated under normal \nmanagement conditions. In addition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is \naddressed by standards set by the Department of Transport ation, Office of Safety and Health \nAdministration, and local fire codes. These standards include requirements for outer packaging and \ncan design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas and general pressure conditions. Finally, \nas discussed below, the proposed management standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA \nbelieves that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the univ ersal waste \ndesignation. \u201c  \n\u2022 Beyond these standards, additional measures for shipping and accumulation designed to \nminimize potential mixing of incompatible wastes and potential for causing a reaction should be \nincluded.  While measures are proposed to preven t waste from leaving the aerosol can, some \nleakage will be inevitable.  Commenters suggest requiring separation of incompatible wastes \nrather than allowing separation.  Commenters also recommend requiring storage areas to meet \ntemperature requirements to re duce the likelihood of a strong reaction.  \nPage 6 of 14 \n \u2022 While there is agreement with having these management standards codified, additional \nlanguage is needed to clarify that after the aerosol can is punctured, it can no longer be managed \nas universal waste.  For hazar dous waste generators, management of the removed product \nand/or propellent should be presented to clarify that this subsequent management is not part \nof universal waste handling. Most small quantity gene rators ( SQGs ) and large quantity \ngenerators ( LQGs ) will only be handling their own aerosol cans and not unive rsal waste aerosols \nreceived from others.  If the intent is to allow management of aerosol cans as universal waste \non-site prior to on -site puncturing and then making determinations on the separate waste \nstreams, this should be made explicit in the rule.  \n12. Page 11660, 1st column, 2nd paragraph . The preamble states: EPA also intends this definition to be \nlimited to sealed containers whose intended use is to dispense a material by means of a propellant or \ncompressed gas. Aerosol cans are designed to contain th ose materials until they are intended for \nrelease and to present minimal risk during normal storage and transport. Other types of containers, \nincluding compressed gas canisters and propane cylinders, present a greater risk than aerosol cans \nand would not b e included.  \n\u2022 If this is the intention, it should be clearly stated in the final regulation, not just as part of the \npreamble.  The proposed definition leaves room for interpretation and the intent stated in the \npreamble to limit the definition to specific s ealed containers is therefore unenforceable.  \n13. Page 11660, 1st column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA requests comment on whether to \ninclude a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of limitations on the types of aerosol cans that \nwould be eligible for the federal universal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit \nwould be necessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment on the \nappropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the types of materials that should fall under \nit. \n\u2022 A number of States support a siz e limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit seem appropriate. \nThe 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table identifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for \neach category, specifies \u201ceach not exceeding 1 L capacity\u201d.  While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are n ot \nlarge, any size could fall within the proposed definition.  An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be purchased \nfrom home improvement stores.   \n\u2022 One State offered that it does not believe there should be a size limitation on the aerosol cans \neligible for the universal waste regulations.  \n\u2022 Commenters also strongly encourage adding language to limit applicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d \naerosol cans.  A quick internet search produces vide os of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as \nhand -pump pesticide applicators, which both meet the proposed definition.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the term \u201ccan\u201d be replaced with the term \u201ccontainer\u201d to make it clear \nthat products packaged in plastic aerosol cont ainers are eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The term \u201ccan\u201d strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the \napplicability of the definition and excludes plastic containers from being eligible to be managed \nas a universal waste.   \n \nPage 7 of 14 \n Plastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently are not as prevalent \nin the marketplace as metal aerosol containers.  Plastic aerosol container s can be used to \npackage:  \n \n\u25aa Personal care, e.g., shaving gels and foams, hair care, bo dy moisturizers  \n\u25aa Home care, e.g., air fresheners, cleaning applications, insecticides  \n\u25aa Food, e.g., oils, cooking mists, creams and sauces  \n\u25aa Industrial applications  \nIn addition, the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d needs to be clarified to exclude compressed gas \ncylinders and to include aerosol gels such as shaving cream.  \n14. Page 11660, 2nd column, 3rd paragraph. Preamble discussion about empty  aerosol cans and point of \ngeneration . \n\u2022 EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are  not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal.  This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement.  A container that meets the definition of empty is not subject \nto the hazardous waste regulations.  However, what is mi sleading about the statement is that \nthe aerosol can must be RCRA empty, per 40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal.   \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6.  Scrap metal is a \u201crecyclable material\u201d and \n\u201crecyclable material\u201d is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled.  Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to be completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P -listed waste) to \nbe classified and recycled as scrap metal.  However, it is a good management practice to remove \nas much of the waste from the aerosol can as possible.  EPA should clarify this point.  \n\u2022 Also, this rulemaking presents the opportunity for EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a RCRA empty container.  This can be accomplished by adding a provision to 40 \nCFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when it has been punctured and drained.  \nThis provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed wastes.  By declaring the \npunctured can a new point of waste generation , thus requiring the container to be evaluated to \ndetermine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container itself is a \nhazardous waste , negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste and needlessl y makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement. \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated.  \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nand send them to another handler or destination facility.  In at least one State, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash f or metal recovery.  \nEPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \u201cintact\u201d from the definition of aerosol can so that \nthe definition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or EPA can  include the term \u201cpunctured \naerosol cans\u201d in the definition.  \nPage 8 of 14 \n The liquid contents removed from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents.  The \ncontainer co ntents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste.  \n15. Page 11661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: EPA is proposing that puncturing and \ndraining activities must be conducted by a commercial device specifically designed to sa fely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any emissions thereof.  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that to be evaluated \nby handlers and inspectors?  \n16. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has previously \ninvestigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and draining device through EPA\u2019s \nEnvironmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The ETV review demonstrated one type of \ndrum -top puncturing and draining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before \nbreakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 750 cans \nrecommended by some manufacturers. The drum that conta ined the drained liquid from the aerosol \ncans was also never more than 25% full before breakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary \nto manufacturer recommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthrough \u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated compounds (e.g., \nchlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal and gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of puncturing \nand draining devices currently available on the market, the only ways to ensure puncturing and \ndraining activities are containing emissions are to either implement an air monitoring program \nwith recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices used are equipped with \u201cend of \nlife\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is occurring.  \n17. Page 11661, second column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cTherefore, EPA is proposing that \nhandlers must establish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and  drain universal \nwaste aerosol can (including operation and maintenance of the unit; segregation of incompatible \nwastes; and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases), and ensure employees \noperating the device are trained in the prope r procedures.\u201d  \n\u2022 One State is requesting clarification in the proposed rule under \u00a7 273.13 (e)(1), which states \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and  lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d.  It is unclear if \naccumulation containers are to be \u201cclosed containers\u201d to minimize release risks as is required \nof containers for other univ ersal waste streams.   \n \n\u2022 While EPA states on page 11661 (second column, top paragraph): \u201cOperators of puncturing and \ndraining devices are also instructed to ensure that the container remains closed, \u2026,\u201d, there is no \nproposed requirement to keep containers c losed.  \n \n \nPage 9 of 14 \n 18. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The preamble states: EPA is requesting comment on \nestablishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining devices and limits on aerosol cans \nthat may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed \nrules.  \n\u2022 One State suggests adding language to clarify that once a can has been punctured, neither the \ncan nor the collected contents remain universal waste.  The State elaborates that the handler \nhas generated at leas t two distinct waste streams and must make accurate hazardous waste \ndeterminations on both.  Moreover, if the contents from different types of cans are mixed in the \nsame collection container, a more complicated determination will result.  Since the content s of \nvarious types of containers are likely to be combined, the ultimate waste determination is more \nlikely to be inaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must be conducted \nusing a commercial device, this language does not carry through to the definition.  If not \nspecifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d devices which would not have the \ninstructions, recommendations, safety testing, and testing on emissions captu re that \ncommenters believe are necessary to protect human health and the environment.  As such, \nthese commenters recommend revising the proposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct \npuncturing and draining activities using a commercially manufactured  device spec ifically \ndesigned to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents and any \nemissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 If the safety depends on the design of the cans to contain product, perhaps storage conditions \nneed to be product -like in some ways,  for example, noting the maximum temperature, \nindoors/under cover from rain, sun.  \n\u2022 A few States recommend requiring that a maintenance record be kept to document \nmaintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for breakthrough (that, at a \nminimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations). Those States also \nrecommend that a record be kept documenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to \ndemonstrate that incompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate  proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n\u2022 One State suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans \naccording to accepted engineering practices base d on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.   \n\u2022 One State suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can sate llite accumulation areas \nbe added to the rule to reduce the burden associated with tracking the universal waste storage \ntime limit for large facilities that have multiple areas where aerosol cans are generated.  In \naddition, the provision also accommodates  large facilities that have specific waste pickup \nschedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked up on an assigned day \nthroughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area.  \nThe State suggests allowing the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work area \nwhere aerosol cans are initially generated and collected.  The collection container shall not have \nPage 10 of 14 \n a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved to the \nuniversal  waste storage area.  Once in the storage are, the one -year storage time limit begins \nfor the aerosol cans.  This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection.  \nA number of aerosol can unit s crush the aerosol container after the container has been \npunctured.  The preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal \nwaste rules.  Crushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the \naeroso l cans in addition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or \ndestination facility since one 55 -gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four \ndrums of uncrushed cans.  \n19. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble sta tes: EPA is requesting comment on limiting \npuncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., a person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation).  \n\u2022 The term \u201ccommercial process ors\u201d should be defined in the final rule. Based on the \nparenthetical statement, it is not clear how one distinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from \nany handler who punctures/drains aerosol cans since most handlers are compensated for \nreceiving (and managin g) universal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 One State recommends adding language to the proposed regulations that would prohibit \n\u201ccommercial processors\u201d from puncturing universal waste aerosol cans.  In addition, that State \nrecommends that EPA define the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d within the regulations or use \nother words, such as \u201cany handler other than the original generator of the aerosol cans or the \ndestination facility\u201d to describe the prohibition.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercia l processers\u201d may be managing larger \nquantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they also are likely to be using more \nsophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than generators, and more experienced and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limi ts of that equipment.  Larger processors are also more \nlikely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans and which of those materials \nare incompatible and which materials may have an adverse impact on the seals/gaskets of \npuncturing/drain ing equipment.  \n\u2022 One State pointed out that as noted in Appendix B of the RIA, entitled \u201cPuncturing Options\u201d, \nEPA is concerned about the potential for large buildups of aerosol cans at handlers that may not \nbe properly equipped to puncture and drain such a l arge quantity of cans.  While this is a major \nconcern, another issue is whether the rule, as currently written, adequately protects against a \nsituation where a handler accepts a large quantity of cans, removes and sells the scrap metal, \nand accumulates a l arge quantity of liquid waste that must be managed as hazardous, but does \nnot properly dispose of it.  \nThe approach of limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial \nprocessors is preferred (unless permitted as a RCRA Subtitl e C hazardous waste treatment \nfacility), as it may help reduce the potential stockpiling or abandonment of large quantities of \nwaste, which increases the risk of mismanagement and/or abandonment of the waste.  \nPage 11 of 14 \n \u2022 If EPA decides not to include this provision re quiring a permit for commercial handlers, then \nlanguage should be added to ensure that any handlers receiving aerosol cans from another \nhandler segregate incompatibles to ensure that incompatible wastes are not placed in the same \ncontainer after cans are p unctured.  \n\u2022 One State supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service.  Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their fac ility and puncture and drain the cans on \nthe handler\u2019s site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper \nshredding services work.   \nIn addition, the State noted that many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial \nwaste  company to oversee and operate household hazardous waste collection centers.  Since \nthe operator is paid to oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste \nhandler of aerosol cans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and  industrial facilities. \nThis restriction results in a missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services \nwhere aerosol cans may be properly managed, treated, recycled or disposed.  \n20. Page 11662, 3rd column, Section 4 (Applicability of Land Disp osal Restriction Requirements).  \n\u2022 This section describes how Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) requirements are to be addressed for \nboth handlers and destination facilities and suggests that aerosol cans be exempt for handlers \nand transporters.  While this ap proach makes sense, the section does not explain the scenario \nwhere universal waste handlers that puncture cans will become hazardous waste generators \nand must comply with the applicable requirements of 40 CFR Part 268.  To address this concern, \nit is sugg ested that the potential applicability of the LDR restrictions be highlighted in the final \nrule.  \nIn addition, it is suggested that the emphasis on compliance with 40 CFR Part 268 be included \nwithin the proposed regulatory language on page 11666 of the prop osed rule.  Specifically, 40 \nCFR 273.13(e)(3)(v) as proposed requires handlers to (1) conduct a hazardous waste \ndetermination and (2) manage any hazardous waste generated as a result of puncturing and \ndraining in compliance with all applicable requirements  of 40 CFR parts 260 through 272.  \nAdditionally, it is suggested that the citation include a specific reference to 40 CFR Part 268 - \nLand Disposal Restrictions.  \nSpecific Comments regarding Proposed Rule Language  \n21. Pages 11665 and 11666, \u00a7 273.6 and \u00a7 273.9.  \nThere appears to be a lack of clarity between the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d in \u00a7 273.9 and the \napplicability statement in \u00a7 273.6(b).  The definition states that an aerosol can is a container holding a \ngas under pressure and material (product) which is dispe nsed via a valve.  The applicability statement \nindicates that an \u201caerosol can\u201d is or is not a hazardous waste under certain prescribed circumstances.  It \nis our opinion that the aerosol can is a container which may or may not hold regulated hazardous waste  \nin liquid or gaseous form.   \n \n  \nPage 12 of 14 \n 22. Page 11665, \u00a7 273.6(b)(1).  \n \n\u2022 Please check grammar; change second use of the term \u201ccans\u201d to \u201ccan.\u201d  \n \n23. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(2).  \n \n\u2022 Please check this rule language for clarity.  It appears that the words \u201ccontents of the\u201d should \nappear before \u201caerosol can\u201d otherwise, only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine \nif it is a characteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can.  \n \n\u2022 One State suggests that EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clea r to the \nregulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes.  Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated, resulting in the release of the content s from the can, that the \naerosol can is a reactive hazardous waste.  However, such an occurrence does not meet the \ndefinition of a reactive hazardous waste.  Any material in a sealed container, be it a container of \nmilk or a drum of waste, will burst if o verheated.  EPA provides a good explanation of this \nphysical phenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably \nin the rule, that aerosol cans are not reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the \ncontainer actually  meet the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23.  \n \n\u2022 In addition, the definition of reactivity states \u201ca waste exhibits the characteristic of reactivity. . \n.if it is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating sou rce \nor if heated under confinement.\u201d  Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382.  It is important to \nnote that detonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions.  An explosive reaction is a \nchemical reaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a  substance occurs thereby \nreleasing hot gases which exert great pressure on the surroundings.  Detonation is also an \nexplosive reaction in which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the \nspeed of sound.  An overheated container th at bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is a physical \nphenomenon where the structural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure \nexerted by the heated contents in the container.  \n \n\u2022 Further, the definition of reactivity was \u201cintended to ident ify wastes, that because of their \nextreme instability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of \nthe waste management process \u201d, 45 FR 33109.  It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this \ntype of hazard.  A potential haza rd an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content \nis released (even during normal use) and an ignition source is present.  \n \n24. Page 11665,  \u00a7 273.6(b)(4).  \n \n\u2022 One State does not support EPA\u2019s proposal to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from \nbeing classified and managed as universal wastes.  That State supports that leaking or damaged \naerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal wast es.  \n  \nThe State believes that excluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste \nprogram complicates implementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the \nrule less understandable.  Also, the exclusion of leaking/damage d cans offers minimal additional \nPage 13 of 14 \n environmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules.  \n \nFurther, under that State\u2019s universal waste program, bot h leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainers and punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal \nwaste.  The State specifies that it specifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol \ncontainer in its recently adopted u niversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring \nleaking or damaged aerosol containers to be overpacked with absorbent or immediately \npunctured to remove the contents of the container.  The State believes that allowing leaking, \ndamaged and punctured  aerosol containers to remain eligible to be managed as universal \nwastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal of the waste and provides for an easily \nunderstood regulatory system for aerosol containers.  \n \n25. Page 11666,  \u00a7 273.13(e)(1)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e) (1). The proposed regulations states: Universal \nwaste aerosol cans must be accumulated in a container that is structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the aerosol cans and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage u nder reasonably foreseeable conditions  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may contain a wide array of products, we believe the accumulation \nrequirements for SQHUWs and LQ HUWs should be revised to specify that waste aerosol cans \ncontaining incompatible materials should not  be accumulated in the same container.  \n26. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations states: A \n(small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty \npunctured aerosol cans\u2026  \n\u2022 It should  be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally available.  If recycling is not \navailable in a region, does that mean that puncturing/draining of aerosol cans is not an option \nin that region?  There needs to be further discussion of this requirement in the preamble of the \nfinal rule.  \n \nAlthough the proposed rule states (in 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3) for SQHUW) the UW handler can \npuncture \u201ctheir\u201d aerosol cans, the text is not clear that the term \u201ctheir\u201d includes UW aerosol \ncans accepted from off -site sources.  The final rule language should be clear as to whether \n\u201ctheir\u201d includes off -site sources.  \n\u2022 One State encourages EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans regardless \nwhether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not.  The cost of treatin g a drum of aerosol cans \nby incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids by energy \nrecovery.  This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly dispose of \nthe undrained cans in the normal tra sh.  Therefore, allowing the puncturing of cans even though \nthe can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection, proper management and recycling \nof the can contents.  \n \nIn addition, EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order  to allow a \nhandler to puncture aerosol cans.  Under the universal waste rules, EPA or a State has the ability \nto adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to further \nencourage the proper management, treatment and d isposal of the waste.  \nPage 14 of 14 \n 27. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii)  /Page 11667,  \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations states: \nEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) universal waste aerosol \ncan (including proper assembly, operati on and maintenance of the unit, segregation of incompatible \nwastes, and proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026  \n\u2022 Not only should a written procedure be established, it is recommended to add the words \u201cand \nfollow\u201d so the revised req uirement would read: \u201cEstablish and follow  a written procedure \ndetailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 There is a further recommendation to revise this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely puncture and \nremove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensu re the capture and \ncontainment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the compatibi lity of \nthe contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining equipment.  \n28. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iii)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations states: Ensure \nthat puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires an d to prevent the release of any \ncomponent of universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the \nequipment on a solid, flat surface in a well ventilated area.  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation \u00a7 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to pu ncture aerosol cans provided \nthey \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission thereof\u201d.   This implies that all \nhazardous waste gases will be collected or captured during the activity.  If so, one State asks \nwhy puncturing equipment must be located in a well  ventilated area?  \n\u2022 Another State suggests that puncturing and draining equipment be vented outside to the \natmosphere.  \n29. Page 11666, \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(iv)  /Page 11667, \u00a7 273.33(e)(3)(iv).  \n\u2022 Paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) an d 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) through \n273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant.  The intent of the rules can be clarified \nby deleting paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv).   \nParagraph (e)(3)(iv) requires that the content s of the aerosol cans be contained in a container \nor tank that meets the hazardous waste generator requirement regardless whether the waste \nis hazardous or not.  However, paragraph (e)(3)(vii) contradicts paragraph (e)(3)(iv) by stating \nthat if the content s of the aerosol can are nonhazardous, the handler may manage the waste in \nany manner that is in compliance with applicable rules.  \n \n \n"

    "comment_text": "I believe this regulation would be great for the environment, and that if implemented it would be a major improvement to the waste system in our country. I have a few concerns and questions about the actual process of adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program, but ultimately I support the regulation and think it will be beneficial for our country.\n\n-Defining hazardous waste aerosol cans as universal waste:\n\nThe EPA has the analyzed the status of aerosol cans and believes that it fulfills the requirements of being considered a universal waste. The first four requirements appear to be obviously fulfilled by aerosol cans, because they are clearly hazardous wastes, are not exclusive to one industry, are generated by many generators (often generated in small quantities), and the system for collecting the waste is closely monitored. The fifth requirement appears to be met as well, but it depends on whether or not aerosol cans would be able to remain intact throughout the process of disposal. I wonder if there is a procedure outlined for situations in which one of the cans does not remain intact and poses a health risk, and whether or not aerosol cans are particularly prone to spills or other mistakes occurring in the recycling process. The sixth requirement seems to be met as well, given that the EPA claims that it will be more economical for waste generators to send the cans to recycling facilities instead of landfills. The last two requirements appear to be met, provided the EPAs estimate for the future is accurate.\n\n-The process of recycling aerosol cans:\n\nI am curious as to whether or not American recycling facilities are currently equipped to handle a large influx of aerosol cans, seeing as there are so many of them used in the retail and manufacturing industries every year. The process of puncturing and draining the cans seems to have very little room for error, and people at the facilities will have to be monitored in order to make sure that the process of recycling the cans is carried out according to the plan outlined in the proposal. The health risks could be a concern if there are leaks and spills at some of the facilities.\n\n-Final thoughts:\n\nI am slightly curious as to why hazardous waste aerosol cans have not been added to the universal waste program earlier, as it seems like aerosol cans meet the requirements for being considered a universal waste and they generate a large amount of waste. I believe this proposal should be approved, and that it would be much better for the environment than the current system, as long as the process of recycling the cans is carried out safely and according to protocol.",

    "comment_text": "Overall, I believe that the proposed rule to include hazardous aerosol cans on the universal waste list under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is a good idea. The rule will help enhance personal safety when disposing of hazardous aerosol cans and prevent solid waste in the form of aerosol cans from making it into non-hazardous landfills.\n\nAvoidance of Puncturing Aerosol Cans at the Generator Level\n\nWaste generators will often puncture aerosol cans to attain empty status pursuant to 40 CFR 261.7. Because propellants are often highly flammable substances that could easily be ignited if proper care isnt taken. This makes proper training of aerosol can disposal necessary. The development of a collection plan of these aerosol cans will make it easier for generators to dispose of their aerosol cans and eliminate the need for hazardous aerosol waste training and eliminate the dangers associated with aerosol can puncturing. Universal waste handlers will be able to collect these cans, empty them, and dispose of them adequately.\n\nThere is concern over incompatibility of aerosol contents being drained. Because mixtures of chemicals can lead dangerous reactions, chemicals that are known to cause adverse reactions should be considered in the draining process. A suggestion is to not include Ethers including ethyl ether, chlorinated compounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners and unknowns; or alternatively, require special regulations that would mandate the drainage of these incompatible chemicals into separate basins.\n\nRecycling of Aerosol Cans will be Encouraged\n\nBecause aerosol cans will be more easily collected by universal waste handlers, waste generators will be less inclined to dispose of their aerosol cans to a landfill. Once aerosol cans have been collected and emptied, they are then able to be recycled.\n\nLimitation to Aerosol Containers larger than 24 oz.\n\nThere is no indication in Utahs description of aerosol can in R315-273-9 that gives a rationale for limiting the definition to 24 oz. cans. Therefore, it would seem arbitrary for the EPA to utilize the same size restriction for its definition of aerosol can.",

ACA appreciates the \nopportunity to comment on the proposed rule, an d looks forward t o assisting EPA throughout the  rulemaking  \nprocess.  \n \n1. Definition of \u201cAerosol Can\u201d  \n \nIn the proposed rule, EPA defines \u201caerosol can\u201d as \u201can intact container in which gas under pressure is used to \naerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d2 EPA states in the preamble \nthat this definition is the same as the definition used in the California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah \nuniversal waste programs, with the exception of a size limit in Utah\u2019s definition. ACA supports this con sistency \nand believes that the scope of the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d is appropriate . \n \nFurthermore , ACA does not believe that EPA should include a size limit of twenty -four  (24) ounces or any other  \nlimitation  on the types of aerosol can s that would be eligibl e under this  rule. As mentioned, the definition of \naerosol can under Utah\u2019s universal waste program includes a size limitation of twe nty-four  (24) ounces .3 The \nU.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) already limits the capacity of an aerosol container to one  (1) liter.4 \nSince aerosol cans would need to follow this limitation to be transported as a product , it is not necessary to \nduplicate the limitation in this proposed rule. Thus, ACA does not believe that EPA should include a size \nlimitation on universal waste  aerosol cans.  \n \n                                                 \n1 The American Coatings Association (ACA) is a voluntary, nonprofit trade association working to advance the needs of the \npaint and coatings industry and the professionals who work in it. The organization represents paint and coatings \nmanufacturers, raw mat erials suppliers, distributors, and technical professionals. ACA serves as an advocate and ally for \nmembers on legislative, regulatory, and judicial issues, and provides forums for the advancement and promotion of the \nindustry through educational and profe ssional development services.  \n2 83 FR 11660.  \n3 Utah Administrative Code R315- 273- 9(a).  \n4 49 CFR \u00a7 173.306.  \n2 \n 2. Puncturing and Draining Requirements  \n \nUnder EPA\u2019s Universal Waste Regulations, s ections 273.13 and 273.33 outline the waste management \nrequirements for small quantity handlers of universal waste and large quantity handlers of universal wast e. For \naerosol cans, the proposed rule allows small quantity handlers and large quantity handlers to puncture and \ndrain their aerosol cans , so long as the empty punctured aerosol cans are recycled and the handlers follow \nseven specific requirements while performing the actual puncturing and draining of the hazardous waste \naerosol cans .5 ACA believes that the puncturing and draining requirements th at EPA is proposing are \nappropriate , and that no further limitations need to be imposed on h andlers who puncture and drain aerosol \ncans . The proposed limitations are consistent with other state universal  waste aerosol programs , including \nuniversal waste programs in California, Colorado, New Mexic o, Ohio, and Utah.  \n \nFurthermore, ACA  supports  EPA\u2019s  proposed regulatory requirements for can -draining devices . One of the \nrequirements for universal waste handlers who puncture and drain their aerosol cans is that the handler \n\u201cconduct puncturing and draining activities using a device specifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans \nand effectively contain the residual contents and any emissions thereof.\u201d6 This requirement ensures  the safety \nof the han dler and the environment. In addition , ACA and its member companies are  not aware of any \ncompatibility problems that would be posed for aerosol can puncturing and draining with regards to the paint \nand coatings industry.  \n \n3. Effect on State Authorization \n \nIn the state authority section of the preamble, EPA explains that  \u201csome states have already added aerosol cans \nto [its] list of universal wastes \u2026. If a state\u2019s standards for aerosol cans are less stringent than those in the final \nrule, the state would have to amend  its regulations to make them at least equivalent to the federal standards \nand pursue authorization.\u201d7 ACA recognizes that EPA has tried to develop a proposal consistent with existing \nstate rules to minimize the effect of a federal rule on state authorizat ion. However, there are  some differences \nbetween EPA\u2019s proposed rule and Ohio EPA\u2019s Dec . 8, 2017 final action that  added \u201caerosol containers\u201d to its \nuniversal waste rules.8 While there are differences in language, ACA believes Ohio EPA\u2019s aerosol container \nuniversal waste rules are as s tringent as EPA\u2019s proposed rule.  ACA supports the approach Ohio EPA has taken.  \n \n4. EPA Background Information R egarding Over -Heating of Aerosol C ans \n \nIn the background section of the preamble,  EPA states that as a resu lt of over -heating an aerosol can, it \u201cmay \nfragment as it  bursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d9 The aerosol industry has performed fire tests on metal aerosol \nproducts since the 1980s whe n fire codes were developed for the safe manufacturing and storage of these \nproducts. When the pressure from an over -heated or o ver-pressurized container cause  contents to release, \nthe product will be released at a designed or known weak point of the container. For a two -piece or three -\npiece metal aerosol product, this would be at the crimp of the dome, the crimp of the bottom, or possibly at a \nseam. The resulting burst would not result in the container releasing metal shards. ACA suggests EPA \nsubstant iate its statement from  the preamble  or otherwise remove it.  \n \n                                                 \n5 40 CFR \u00a7  273.13(e) for small quantity handlers  and 40 CFR \u00a7 273.3 3(e) for large quantity handlers . \n6 40 CFR \u00a7  273.13(e)(3)(i ) for small quantity handlers and 40 CFR \u00a7  273.33(e)(3)(i) for large quantity handlers.  \n7 83 Fed. Reg. 11663 (March 16, 2018).  \n8 Ohio Administrative Code 3745- 273- 01, 09, 13, 14, 33, 34, and 89.  \n9 83 Fed. Reg. 11656 (March 16, 2018).  \n3 \n 5. Adding Paint and Paint Related Waste to the Federal Universal Waste Regulations  \n \nLastly, in the background section of the preamble, EPA states, \u201caerosol cans are widely used for dispensing a \nbroad range of products including paint s\u2026.\u201d ACA recommends that EPA consider adding \u201cpaint and paint -\nrelated waste\u201d to the federal universal waste program. ACA believes that \u201cpaint and paint -related waste \u201d \nmeets the factors that describe hazardous waste that is  appropriate for management under the st reamlined \nuniversal waste system . \n \nThank you for your consideration of our comments and concerns. We look forward to  work ing with EPA  as it \ndevelops  the universal waste program . Please do not hesitate  to contact us  if you have any questions.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n/s/     /s/     /s/ \n \nRhett Cash     Raleigh Davis     Xavier Ferrier  \nCounsel, Government Affairs   Assistant Director, Environmental  Specialist , Environmental  \nHealth &  Safety  Health & Safety  \n \n \n**Sent via regulations.gov ** \n"

Reg. 11654 ]; comments must be received \nby EPA on or before May 15, 201 8. \n The EHSCP  is a consortium of communications environmental, health , and safety (EH&S) professionals \ndedicated to promoting employee safety and health, and environmental responsibility throughout the \ncommunications industry . The EHSCP  strives to provide constructive input to the development and \nimplementation of environmental, health,  and safety standards and guidelines that affect the varied \nbusinesses withi n the communications industry . As such, the panel maintains an active advocacy role, \nproviding comments and recommendations to federal and state agencies where issues concern the \ncommunications industry.  More information regarding the EHSCP can be found at  www.ehscp.org\n. \n \nEHSCP applauds EPA\u2019s efforts to facilitate collection and sound environmental management of used aerosol cans. We agree that the Universal Waste Rules (UWRs) provide the most appropriate  \nregulatory stru cture for aerosol cans. The telecommunications industry uses products in aerosol cans \nat many remote field locations, the majority of which are very small quantity generator sites. Regulation  as universal waste will allow the industry to collect these from  our many remote locations \nin sufficient quantities to facilitate recycling and other environmentally preferable management options.  \n \n                                                             \n1The EHSCP member companies include AT&T, Bell, CenturyLink, Comcast, Crown Castle, Ericsson, Ledcor Technical Services, Nokia, Rise \nBroadband, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Windstream Communications.  \n2 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n The EHSCP strongly supports the proposed rule in most of its elements. However; we recommend a \nfew changes to increase clarity or effectiveness.  \n \nSize Limits:  \n The preamble to the proposed rule mentions that one state includes a size limit of 24 ounces for aerosol cans to qualify as universal waste then continues \u201cEPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that \nmeet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system. \u201d ( \n83 FR 11660) .   \n \nEHSCP concurs with the EPA that a size limit is arbitrary, u nnecessary, and would detract from the goal \nof the UWRs. Typical aerosol cans range in size from 2 ounces to 32 ounces. The environmental risk from aerosol cans is related to their aggregate contents, not the capacity of each aerosol can. Setting \nan arbitrary size limit would force generators to segregate small aerosol cans for universal waste \nmanagement, and larger aerosol cans for hazardous waste management. This adds unnecessary \nburden that could cause some Very Small Quantity Generators  to not to take a dvantage of the UWRs \nand result in aerosol cans being disposed and not recycled.  \n  \nAerosol Can Definition:  \n \nAt 40 CFR 260.10 and 40 CFR 273.9 EPA proposed to define aerosol can as  \n \n\u201c\u2026 an intact container in which gas under pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material \nthrough a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d   \n \nThere are two ways in which this fails to accurately describe cans commonly referred to as aerosol cans and may in troduce confusion as to what cans may be managed as universal waste.  \n\u2022 Large gas cylinders and associated systems may aerate and dispense a spray, but aren\u2019t aerosol cans. The US Department of Transportation in its definition in 49 CFR 171.8 recognizes \ntwo d esign features that distinguish aerosol cans \u2014they are \u201cnon -refillable\u201d and they \nincorporate a \u201cself -closing release device\u201d. Adding these two characteristics to the definition \nwill distinguish aerosol cans from cylinders.  \n\u2022 Many products commonly referred to  as aerosol cans produce a material that some people \nwould not recognize as a spray or foam. For example, some insecticides produce a stream; \nsome produce a fog. This could result in some aerosols not being recycled under the UWR.  \n \nEHSCP recommends that th e definition of \u201cAerosol can\u201d be modified to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cAerosol can means an intact, non -refillable  container in which gas under pressure is used \nto aerate and dispense  expel  any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam  a \nself-closing release device\u201d.  \n3 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n  \n \nLeaking aerosol cans:  \n In section 273.6(b)(4), th e proposed rule excludes : \n \n\u201cAerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d  \n We question the need to exclude damaged cans  and particularly to exclude cans that show evidence \nof past spillage . This would remove many aerosol cans from management as universal waste and \nwould reduce the  benefits of the rule , both environmental and fina ncial. E xisting  universal waste rule s \nprovide standards for managing damaged or leaking containers  by containing them with in an other  \nintact container. Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment. The c ontainer must be \nclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol can and must lack \nevidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of any \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foresee able conditions \u201d. \n \nPuncturing and draining aerosol cans:  \n  1. Sections 273.13(e)(3) and 273.33(e)(3)  of the proposed rule broadly refer to hazardous waste  \naerosol cans. Since the rule only applies to hazardous wastes being managed as universal wastes , \nthe reference to hazardous waste could cause confusion.  \n \nWe recommend changing the text to read:  \n \n\u201cA \u2026 handler of universal waste who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following requirements  while puncturing and \ndraining hazardous waste\n universal waste  aerosol cans \u201d  --  \n 2. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iii) and 273.33(e)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule read \u201cEnsure that puncturing of \nthe can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of any component of \n4 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on \na solid, flat surface in a w ell ventilated area\u201d. We suggest two changes to this paragraph.  \n \na. First, t he term \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d is not well defined. Aerosol cans typically \ninclude a non -hazardous compressed gas as a propellant  which could be interpreted to be a \n\u201ccomponent\u201d of the universal waste aerosol can . It would require very sophisticated \nengineering and provide  no environmental benefit to prevent the release of an inert gas. We \nsuggest replacing \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d with the well -defined terms \u201chazardous \nwaste or hazardous w aste constituent\u201d.  This w ill accomplish EPA\u2019s purpose more clearly while \npreventing misinterpretations.  \n \nb. Second,  we understand  it is common practice to manage device s of this sort on spill catchment \npallets consisting of a catchment basin  covered by a metal or plastic grating that supports the \npuncturing device. This practice aids in capturing any incidental leak or spill. We recommend replacing \u201csolid, flat surface\u201d with \u201cstable surface\u201d to allow for such practice.  \n As amended, this paragraph would read : \n \n\u201cEnsure that puncturing of the can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent \nthe release of any component of universal waste\n hazardous waste or hazardo us waste \nconstituent to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment \non a solid, flat  stable  surface in a well ventilated area\u201d  \n  \n3. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v) and 273.33(e)(3)(v) of the proposed rule require that the universal waste \nhandler \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents \nper 40 CFR 262.11.\u201d While we agree on the need for a hazardous waste determination to be made on the contents, requiring it  for th e emptied cans contradicts prior EPA guidance  regarding scrap \nmetal. The proposed rule only allows for puncturing of cans on the condition that the empty punctured aerosol cans be recycled. Existing rules and previous EPA guidance have been clear that a formal hazardous waste determination is not required for scrap metal being recycled under 40 \nCFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii).  (RCRA Online 11782 , 11806 .)   \n We recommend changing the text  to read:  \n \n\u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11 on the \nemptied aerosol can and \nits contents  removed from aerosol cans . Hazardous waste determinations are not needed for \nemptied aerosol cans being managed as scrap metal recycled under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) .\u201d \n 4. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v i) and 273.33(e)(3)(v i) of the proposed rule read \u201cIf the contents are \ndetermined not to be hazardous, the handler may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste regulations\u201d. The phrase \u201cdetermined not to be hazardous \u201d could be ambiguous.   \n \n5 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n We recommend changing the text to read:  \n\u201cIf the contents are determined not to be hazardous  waste , the handler may manage the solid \nwaste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste \nregulati ons\u201d . \n 5. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) of the proposed rule require that a can puncturing process \u201cImmediately transfer the contents from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, \n262.16, or 262.17\u201d. This could be interpreted to imply (although does not explicitly state) that the \ncontainer attached to the puncturing device would be considered an accumulation container, as \nthat is the container that \u201cimmediately\u201d receives the contents. Typical aerosol can puncturing \nsystems consist of a puncturing device and filter  that are mounted to a drum which serves to \nreceive the contents of the punctured can. The drum is an integral part of the punct uring process  \nand is necessary for safe operation . Prior EPA guidance on recycling operations has suggested that \ndevices integral to a recycling process are part of the recycling process and not subject to regulation as waste storage/accumulation devices . Therefore, w e request clarification to confirm \nthat:  \n a. A container installed between the puncturing device and the filter is integral to the puncturing process.  \nb. A container that i s an integral part of the puncturing process is  part of the exempt recycling \nunit and not subject to hazardous waste container requirements . \nc. A container that is part of the exempt recycling unit will retain exempt  status during times \nwhen can puncturing is not actively occurring , the puncturing system is removed  and the \ncontainer remains closed, but will later be returned to aerosol can puncturing service.  \n \nWe suggest changing the language of 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) to read  \n \n\u201cImmediately transfer\n When a universal waste aerosol can is punctured  the contents \nfrom the waste  aerosol can , or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank  must be \nimmediately contained in a device that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, \n262.15, 262.16, or 262.17; or is  an exempt recycling unit. If a container that is part of an \nexempt recycling unit is permanently removed from the recycling unit it must be immediately \nmanaged under the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, or 262.17.\u201d  \n \n \nManaging any aerosol can as  universal waste:  \n In the past, EPA has suggested that solid wastes otherwise meeting the applicability of a universal \nwaste category can be managed as that type of universal waste irrespective of whether they are, in fact, hazardous waste. It is helpful because it allows  all waste aerosol cans to be collected and \nmanaged under a single  program. However, this is not stated anywhere in the UWRs. EHSCP suggests \n6 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n that EPA take this opportunity to add that allowance explicitly in the rules . This could be accomplished \nby amendin g \u00a7273.8(a) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Persons managing the wastes listed below may, at their option, manage them under the \nrequirements of this part:  \n \n(1) Household wastes that are exempt under \u00a7261.4(b)(1) of this chapter and are also of the same type as the univ ersal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9; \nand/or  \n (2) Very small quantity generator wastes that are exempt under \u00a7262.14 of this chapter and are also of the same type as the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9 .\n; and/or  \n \n(3) Solid wastes not meeting the definition of hazardous waste that are  also of the same type \nas the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9.\"  \n \n On behalf of the EHSCP member companies, thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this proposed rule. Please contact me if you need additional information or would like to discuss \nour comments further.  \n Sincerely,  \n \nBryan Stolte  \nChair - Environmental, Health & Safety Communications Panel  \nTel: ( 405)202 -2074  \n \n\n"

Adding these two characteristics to the definition \nwill distinguish aerosol cans from cylinders.  \n\u2022 Many products commonly referred to  as aerosol cans produce a material that some people \nwould not recognize as a spray or foam. For example, some insecticides produce a stream; \nsome produce a fog. This could result in some aerosols not being recycled under the UWR.  \n \nEHSCP recommends that th e definition of \u201cAerosol can\u201d be modified to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cAerosol can means an intact, non -refillable  container in which gas under pressure is used \nto aerate and dispense  expel  any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam  a \nself-closing release device\u201d.  \n3 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n  \n \nLeaking aerosol cans:  \n In section 273.6(b)(4), th e proposed rule excludes : \n \n\u201cAerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d  \n We question the need to exclude damaged cans  and particularly to exclude cans that show evidence \nof past spillage . This would remove many aerosol cans from management as universal waste and \nwould reduce the  benefits of the rule , both environmental and fina ncial. E xisting  universal waste rule s \nprovide standards for managing damaged or leaking containers  by containing them with in an other  \nintact container. Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment. The c ontainer must be \nclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol can and must lack \nevidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of any \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foresee able conditions \u201d. \n \nPuncturing and draining aerosol cans:  \n  1. Sections 273.13(e)(3) and 273.33(e)(3)  of the proposed rule broadly refer to hazardous waste  \naerosol cans. Since the rule only applies to hazardous wastes being managed as universal wastes , \nthe reference to hazardous waste could cause confusion.  \n \nWe recommend changing the text to read:  \n \n\u201cA \u2026 handler of universal waste who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following requirements  while puncturing and \ndraining hazardous waste\n universal waste  aerosol cans \u201d  --  \n 2. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iii) and 273.33(e)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule read \u201cEnsure that puncturing of \nthe can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of any component of \n4 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on \na solid, flat surface in a w ell ventilated area\u201d. We suggest two changes to this paragraph.  \n \na. First, t he term \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d is not well defined. Aerosol cans typically \ninclude a non -hazardous compressed gas as a propellant  which could be interpreted to be a \n\u201ccomponent\u201d of the universal waste aerosol can . It would require very sophisticated \nengineering and provide  no environmental benefit to prevent the release of an inert gas. We \nsuggest replacing \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d with the well -defined terms \u201chazardous \nwaste or hazardous w aste constituent\u201d.  This w ill accomplish EPA\u2019s purpose more clearly while \npreventing misinterpretations.  \n \nb. Second,  we understand  it is common practice to manage device s of this sort on spill catchment \npallets consisting of a catchment basin  covered by a metal or plastic grating that supports the \npuncturing device. This practice aids in capturing any incidental leak or spill. We recommend replacing \u201csolid, flat surface\u201d with \u201cstable surface\u201d to allow for such practice.  \n As amended, this paragraph would read : \n \n\u201cEnsure that puncturing of the can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent \nthe release of any component of universal waste\n hazardous waste or hazardo us waste \nconstituent to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment \non a solid, flat  stable  surface in a well ventilated area\u201d  \n  \n3. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v) and 273.33(e)(3)(v) of the proposed rule require that the universal waste \nhandler \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents \nper 40 CFR 262.11.\u201d While we agree on the need for a hazardous waste determination to be made on the contents, requiring it  for th e emptied cans contradicts prior EPA guidance  regarding scrap \nmetal. The proposed rule only allows for puncturing of cans on the condition that the empty punctured aerosol cans be recycled. Existing rules and previous EPA guidance have been clear that a formal hazardous waste determination is not required for scrap metal being recycled under 40 \nCFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii).  (RCRA Online 11782 , 11806 .)   \n We recommend changing the text  to read:  \n \n\u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11 on the \nemptied aerosol can and \nits contents  removed from aerosol cans . Hazardous waste determinations are not needed for \nemptied aerosol cans being managed as scrap metal recycled under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) .\u201d \n 4. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v i) and 273.33(e)(3)(v i) of the proposed rule read \u201cIf the contents are \ndetermined not to be hazardous, the handler may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste regulations\u201d. The phrase \u201cdetermined not to be hazardous \u201d could be ambiguous.   \n \n5 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n We recommend changing the text to read:  \n\u201cIf the contents are determined not to be hazardous  waste , the handler may manage the solid \nwaste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste \nregulati ons\u201d . \n 5. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) of the proposed rule require that a can puncturing process \u201cImmediately transfer the contents from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, \n262.16, or 262.17\u201d. This could be interpreted to imply (although does not explicitly state) that the \ncontainer attached to the puncturing device would be considered an accumulation container, as \nthat is the container that \u201cimmediately\u201d receives the contents. Typical aerosol can puncturing \nsystems consist of a puncturing device and filter  that are mounted to a drum which serves to \nreceive the contents of the punctured can. The drum is an integral part of the punct uring process  \nand is necessary for safe operation . Prior EPA guidance on recycling operations has suggested that \ndevices integral to a recycling process are part of the recycling process and not subject to regulation as waste storage/accumulation devices . Therefore, w e request clarification to confirm \nthat:  \n a. A container installed between the puncturing device and the filter is integral to the puncturing process.  \nb. A container that i s an integral part of the puncturing process is  part of the exempt recycling \nunit and not subject to hazardous waste container requirements . \nc. A container that is part of the exempt recycling unit will retain exempt  status during times \nwhen can puncturing is not actively occurring , the puncturing system is removed  and the \ncontainer remains closed, but will later be returned to aerosol can puncturing service.  \n \nWe suggest changing the language of 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) to read  \n \n\u201cImmediately transfer\n When a universal waste aerosol can is punctured  the contents \nfrom the waste  aerosol can , or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank  must be \nimmediately contained in a device that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, \n262.15, 262.16, or 262.17; or is  an exempt recycling unit. If a container that is part of an \nexempt recycling unit is permanently removed from the recycling unit it must be immediately \nmanaged under the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, or 262.17.\u201d  \n \n \nManaging any aerosol can as  universal waste:  \n In the past, EPA has suggested that solid wastes otherwise meeting the applicability of a universal \nwaste category can be managed as that type of universal waste irrespective of whether they are, in fact, hazardous waste. It is helpful because it allows  all waste aerosol cans to be collected and \nmanaged under a single  program. However, this is not stated anywhere in the UWRs. EHSCP suggests \n6 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n that EPA take this opportunity to add that allowance explicitly in the rules . This could be accomplished \nby amendin g \u00a7273.8(a) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Persons managing the wastes listed below may, at their option, manage them under the \nrequirements of this part:  \n \n(1) Household wastes that are exempt under \u00a7261.4(b)(1) of this chapter and are also of the same type as the univ ersal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9; \nand/or  \n (2) Very small quantity generator wastes that are exempt under \u00a7262.14 of this chapter and are also of the same type as the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9 .\n; and/or  \n \n(3) Solid wastes not meeting the definition of hazardous waste that are  also of the same type \nas the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9.\"  \n \n On behalf of the EHSCP member companies, thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this proposed rule.

Reg. 11654 ]; comments must be received \nby EPA on or before May 15, 201 8. \n The EHSCP  is a consortium of communications environmental, health , and safety (EH&S) professionals \ndedicated to promoting employee safety and health, and environmental responsibility throughout the \ncommunications industry . The EHSCP  strives to provide constructive input to the development and \nimplementation of environmental, health,  and safety standards and guidelines that affect the varied \nbusinesses withi n the communications industry . As such, the panel maintains an active advocacy role, \nproviding comments and recommendations to federal and state agencies where issues concern the \ncommunications industry.  More information regarding the EHSCP can be found at  www.ehscp.org\n. \n \nEHSCP applauds EPA\u2019s efforts to facilitate collection and sound environmental management of used aerosol cans. We agree that the Universal Waste Rules (UWRs) provide the most appropriate  \nregulatory stru cture for aerosol cans. The telecommunications industry uses products in aerosol cans \nat many remote field locations, the majority of which are very small quantity generator sites. Regulation  as universal waste will allow the industry to collect these from  our many remote locations \nin sufficient quantities to facilitate recycling and other environmentally preferable management options.  \n \n                                                             \n1The EHSCP member companies include AT&T, Bell, CenturyLink, Comcast, Crown Castle, Ericsson, Ledcor Technical Services, Nokia, Rise \nBroadband, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Windstream Communications.  \n2 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n The EHSCP strongly supports the proposed rule in most of its elements. However; we recommend a \nfew changes to increase clarity or effectiveness.  \n \nSize Limits:  \n The preamble to the proposed rule mentions that one state includes a size limit of 24 ounces for aerosol cans to qualify as universal waste then continues \u201cEPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that \nmeet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system. \u201d ( \n83 FR 11660) .   \n \nEHSCP concurs with the EPA that a size limit is arbitrary, u nnecessary, and would detract from the goal \nof the UWRs. Typical aerosol cans range in size from 2 ounces to 32 ounces. The environmental risk from aerosol cans is related to their aggregate contents, not the capacity of each aerosol can. Setting \nan arbitrary size limit would force generators to segregate small aerosol cans for universal waste \nmanagement, and larger aerosol cans for hazardous waste management. This adds unnecessary \nburden that could cause some Very Small Quantity Generators  to not to take a dvantage of the UWRs \nand result in aerosol cans being disposed and not recycled.  \n  \nAerosol Can Definition:  \n \nAt 40 CFR 260.10 and 40 CFR 273.9 EPA proposed to define aerosol can as  \n \n\u201c\u2026 an intact container in which gas under pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material \nthrough a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d   \n \nThere are two ways in which this fails to accurately describe cans commonly referred to as aerosol cans and may in troduce confusion as to what cans may be managed as universal waste.  \n\u2022 Large gas cylinders and associated systems may aerate and dispense a spray, but aren\u2019t aerosol cans. The US Department of Transportation in its definition in 49 CFR 171.8 recognizes \ntwo d esign features that distinguish aerosol cans \u2014they are \u201cnon -refillable\u201d and they \nincorporate a \u201cself -closing release device\u201d. Adding these two characteristics to the definition \nwill distinguish aerosol cans from cylinders.  \n\u2022 Many products commonly referred to  as aerosol cans produce a material that some people \nwould not recognize as a spray or foam. For example, some insecticides produce a stream; \nsome produce a fog. This could result in some aerosols not being recycled under the UWR.  \n \nEHSCP recommends that th e definition of \u201cAerosol can\u201d be modified to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cAerosol can means an intact, non -refillable  container in which gas under pressure is used \nto aerate and dispense  expel  any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam  a \nself-closing release device\u201d.  \n3 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n  \n \nLeaking aerosol cans:  \n In section 273.6(b)(4), th e proposed rule excludes : \n \n\u201cAerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d  \n We question the need to exclude damaged cans  and particularly to exclude cans that show evidence \nof past spillage . This would remove many aerosol cans from management as universal waste and \nwould reduce the  benefits of the rule , both environmental and fina ncial. E xisting  universal waste rule s \nprovide standards for managing damaged or leaking containers  by containing them with in an other  \nintact container. Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment. The c ontainer must be \nclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol can and must lack \nevidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of any \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foresee able conditions \u201d. \n \nPuncturing and draining aerosol cans:  \n  1. Sections 273.13(e)(3) and 273.33(e)(3)  of the proposed rule broadly refer to hazardous waste  \naerosol cans. Since the rule only applies to hazardous wastes being managed as universal wastes , \nthe reference to hazardous waste could cause confusion.  \n \nWe recommend changing the text to read:  \n \n\u201cA \u2026 handler of universal waste who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following requirements  while puncturing and \ndraining hazardous waste\n universal waste  aerosol cans \u201d  --  \n 2. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iii) and 273.33(e)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule read \u201cEnsure that puncturing of \nthe can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of any component of \n4 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on \na solid, flat surface in a w ell ventilated area\u201d. We suggest two changes to this paragraph.  \n \na. First, t he term \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d is not well defined. Aerosol cans typically \ninclude a non -hazardous compressed gas as a propellant  which could be interpreted to be a \n\u201ccomponent\u201d of the universal waste aerosol can . It would require very sophisticated \nengineering and provide  no environmental benefit to prevent the release of an inert gas. We \nsuggest replacing \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d with the well -defined terms \u201chazardous \nwaste or hazardous w aste constituent\u201d.  This w ill accomplish EPA\u2019s purpose more clearly while \npreventing misinterpretations.  \n \nb. Second,  we understand  it is common practice to manage device s of this sort on spill catchment \npallets consisting of a catchment basin  covered by a metal or plastic grating that supports the \npuncturing device. This practice aids in capturing any incidental leak or spill. We recommend replacing \u201csolid, flat surface\u201d with \u201cstable surface\u201d to allow for such practice.  \n As amended, this paragraph would read : \n \n\u201cEnsure that puncturing of the can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent \nthe release of any component of universal waste\n hazardous waste or hazardo us waste \nconstituent to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment \non a solid, flat  stable  surface in a well ventilated area\u201d  \n  \n3. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v) and 273.33(e)(3)(v) of the proposed rule require that the universal waste \nhandler \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents \nper 40 CFR 262.11.\u201d While we agree on the need for a hazardous waste determination to be made on the contents, requiring it  for th e emptied cans contradicts prior EPA guidance  regarding scrap \nmetal. The proposed rule only allows for puncturing of cans on the condition that the empty punctured aerosol cans be recycled. Existing rules and previous EPA guidance have been clear that a formal hazardous waste determination is not required for scrap metal being recycled under 40 \nCFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii).  (RCRA Online 11782 , 11806 .)   \n We recommend changing the text  to read:  \n \n\u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11 on the \nemptied aerosol can and \nits contents  removed from aerosol cans . Hazardous waste determinations are not needed for \nemptied aerosol cans being managed as scrap metal recycled under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) .\u201d \n 4. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v i) and 273.33(e)(3)(v i) of the proposed rule read \u201cIf the contents are \ndetermined not to be hazardous, the handler may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste regulations\u201d. The phrase \u201cdetermined not to be hazardous \u201d could be ambiguous.   \n \n5 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n We recommend changing the text to read:  \n\u201cIf the contents are determined not to be hazardous  waste , the handler may manage the solid \nwaste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste \nregulati ons\u201d . \n 5. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) of the proposed rule require that a can puncturing process \u201cImmediately transfer the contents from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, \n262.16, or 262.17\u201d. This could be interpreted to imply (although does not explicitly state) that the \ncontainer attached to the puncturing device would be considered an accumulation container, as \nthat is the container that \u201cimmediately\u201d receives the contents. Typical aerosol can puncturing \nsystems consist of a puncturing device and filter  that are mounted to a drum which serves to \nreceive the contents of the punctured can. The drum is an integral part of the punct uring process  \nand is necessary for safe operation . Prior EPA guidance on recycling operations has suggested that \ndevices integral to a recycling process are part of the recycling process and not subject to regulation as waste storage/accumulation devices . Therefore, w e request clarification to confirm \nthat:  \n a. A container installed between the puncturing device and the filter is integral to the puncturing process.  \nb. A container that i s an integral part of the puncturing process is  part of the exempt recycling \nunit and not subject to hazardous waste container requirements . \nc. A container that is part of the exempt recycling unit will retain exempt  status during times \nwhen can puncturing is not actively occurring , the puncturing system is removed  and the \ncontainer remains closed, but will later be returned to aerosol can puncturing service.  \n \nWe suggest changing the language of 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) to read  \n \n\u201cImmediately transfer\n When a universal waste aerosol can is punctured  the contents \nfrom the waste  aerosol can , or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank  must be \nimmediately contained in a device that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, \n262.15, 262.16, or 262.17; or is  an exempt recycling unit. If a container that is part of an \nexempt recycling unit is permanently removed from the recycling unit it must be immediately \nmanaged under the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, or 262.17.\u201d  \n \n \nManaging any aerosol can as  universal waste:  \n In the past, EPA has suggested that solid wastes otherwise meeting the applicability of a universal \nwaste category can be managed as that type of universal waste irrespective of whether they are, in fact, hazardous waste. It is helpful because it allows  all waste aerosol cans to be collected and \nmanaged under a single  program. However, this is not stated anywhere in the UWRs. EHSCP suggests \n6 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n that EPA take this opportunity to add that allowance explicitly in the rules . This could be accomplished \nby amendin g \u00a7273.8(a) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Persons managing the wastes listed below may, at their option, manage them under the \nrequirements of this part:  \n \n(1) Household wastes that are exempt under \u00a7261.4(b)(1) of this chapter and are also of the same type as the univ ersal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9; \nand/or  \n (2) Very small quantity generator wastes that are exempt under \u00a7262.14 of this chapter and are also of the same type as the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9 .\n; and/or  \n \n(3) Solid wastes not meeting the definition of hazardous waste that are  also of the same type \nas the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9.\"  \n \n On behalf of the EHSCP member companies, thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this proposed rule. Please contact me if you need additional information or would like to discuss \nour comments further.  \n Sincerely,  \n \nBryan Stolte  \nChair - Environmental, Health & Safety Communications Panel  \nTel: ( 405)202 -2074  \n \n\n"

Reg . 11,654 (Mar. 16, 2018) . \nThe Steel Associations support EPA\u2019s efforts to identify ineff icient regulatory burdens, streamline \neffective regulation, and encourage proper recycling of metals in aerosol cans.  In fact, Steel \n                                                           \n1  SMA is the largest steel trade association in North America in terms of membership, and the primary trade \nassociation of electric arc furnace (\u201cEAF\u201d) steel producers, often referred to as \u201cminimills,\u201d that make various steel \nproducts, including carbon, alloy, and stainless steels, from a feedstock of nearly 100 percent steel scrap, including \nscrap from recycled aerosol cans.  \nSSINA is a national trade association representing most of the U.S. producers of specialty steel products, including \nstainless, electric, tool, magnetic, and other alloy steels.  SSINA members produce specialty steel alloys in EAFs \nusing scrap steel and other feedstocks.  \nTogether, the Steel Associations represent an i ndustry that directly employs over 150,000 people and indirectly \nsupports over one million jobs in affiliated industries.  \n \nKELLEY DRYE & WARREN  LLP \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage Two \n \n \n \n Association members are the largest recyclers in North America, and steel is recycled five times \nmore than the sum of all other metals combined.  By using steel scrap as a primary feedstock, SMA \nand SSINA members reuse millions of tons of ferrous and specialty scrap that might otherwise be \ndeposited as refuse in landfills or disposed of as litter.  Members recycle aerosol can s used at their \nfacilities, as well as aerosol cans that may be contained in scrap received as feedstock.  \nCurrently, SMA and SSINA members efficiently and safely manage and recycle used aerosol cans \nwithin existing RCRA parameters.  Generally, facilities collect used aerosol cans in satellite \naccumulation areas; operate puncture and drain stations to render the cans \u201cempty\u201d and de -\npressurized; recycle the scrap metal cans; and manage any drained contents or propellants as \nappropriate based on hazard analys is.  These practices are consistent with EPA\u2019s long -standing \nguidance on aerosol can recycling, as noted in the preamble to the proposed rule:  \nEPA has interpreted the current hazardous waste regulations to mean that \npuncturing and draining an aerosol can, if performed for the purpose of recycling \n(e.g., for scrap metal recycling), is considered part of the recycling process and is \nexempt from RCRA permitting requirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).  \n83 Fed. Reg . at 11,656.  \nAccordingly, the proposed regulation \u201cspecifically excludes aerosol cans that have been emptied \nof their contents (both propellant and product)\u201d and further recognizes that \u201c[a]n aerosol can that \nmeets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR 261.7 is n ot subject to hazardous waste \nregulation, and may be recycled as scrap metal.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  \nThe Steel Associations agree with these conclusions and believe that EPA intends in the proposal \nto make clear that existing aerosol can management practices, su ch as those described above, may \ncontinue to operate outside of the proposed \u201cuniversal waste\u201d framework for handling aerosol \ncans.  For example, EPA states:  \nBecause of the likely differences between recycling of aerosol cans at hazardous \nwaste generators versus recycling of aerosol cans at universal waste handlers, EPA \nis proposing specific management standards for the puncturing and draining of \naerosol cans at universal waste handlers, similar to the requirements currently being \nimplemented in states that  have added aerosol cans to their list of universal waste.  \nId. at 11,661.  Hence, it is our understanding that the prescribed puncture and drain provisions of \nthe proposed rule only apply to handlers of universal waste aerosol cans and not to generator \nfacilities that manage used aerosol cans pursuant to the existing RCRA provisions governing \nrecycling and \u201cempty\u201d containers.  While this appears to be the design and intent of the proposed \n \nKELLEY DRYE & WARREN  LLP \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage Three  \n \n \n \n \nrule, the Steel Associations request that EPA confirm this understand ing to avoid any confusion \nabout the compliance status of used aerosol cans managed outside of the \u201cuniversal waste\u201d \nframework.  \nThe Steel Associations appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments and support EPA\u2019s \nefforts to streamline RCRA require ments and recycling activities.  We believe that inclusion of \naerosol cans in the universal waste program with an accompanying exclusion for facilities that \n\u201cempty\u201d and recycle aerosol cans under existing RCRA provisions will eliminate unnecessary \nregulato ry burdens and help facilitate proper recycling.

EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \n \n1. Introduction  \n \nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association (\u201cRILA\u201d) , the Food Marketing Institute (\u201cFMI\u201d), and \nthe National Association of Chain Drug Stores (\u201cNACDS\u201d), and their members (collectively, the \n\u201cRetail Associations\u201d) are pleased to submit these comments in response to  the proposal of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or the \u201cAgency\u201d) to classify and regulate \nhazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct (\u201cRCRA\u201d).  See 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654  (March 16 , 201 8).     \n \nRetailers sell a wide variety of aerosol products in our stores every day that are generally deemed \nsafe for consumption or use by ordinary consumers, and meet all applicable safety regulations. \nExamples include deodorants, hair styling products, shaving creams, cheese, sp ot removers, etc. \nIf a customer discards these products at home, he or she throws it out in the normal municipal \nwaste disposal or recycling stream.  However, when the same consumer product goes unsold by \na store or is returned to a store by a customer, it  may be classified as a \u201chazardous waste,\u201d \npotentially subjecting the store to the same burdensome hazardous waste generator regulations as \na steel mill or chemical plant.  \n \nBecause of the regulatory complexity and uncertainty, retailers often have little c hoice but to \nhandle all their unsold, returned, or used aerosols as fully regulated hazardous wastes, despite the \nfact that the products pose little or no risk to human health and the environment.  As a result \naerosol cans now account for up to 50 percent or more of the materials from the retail sector that \nare deemed to be hazardous wastes.  This imposes tremendous costs on the industry and makes \nrecycling difficult or impractical.  In order to address these issues, a number of states have \nstreamlined the requirements for aerosol wastes by classifying them as universal wastes.  \n \nThe Retail Associations greatly appreciate this opportunity to submit comments on the proposed \naddition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the federal universal waste regulations.  T his is also \nan important opportunity to further build our relationship and continue to work with the Agency \non ways to protect our customers and the environment, while streamlining the burdensome \nregulatory compliance process for our businesses \u2013 two goals  that are not mutually exclusive.  \n\n \n- 2 - \n \n \nWe would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input to EPA, and to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made in these comments.  \n \nSection 2 below provides a general summary of our co mments.  Section 3 provides background \non the Retail Associations and their interest in this rulemaking.  Section 4 expresses the \nAssociations\u2019 strong support for the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes \nas universal wastes, and pr ovides further reasons for such action.  Section 5 explains certain \nchanges to the scope of the proposed rule that we think are essential to make the rule workable \nand to maximize its benefits.  Section 6 urges EPA to clarify that as soon as the final rule  is \nissued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all states without a \nhazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  Section 7 explains why we believe \nthe Agency\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule dram atically underestimates the \ncost savings that could be achieved under  the proposal (with the changes we are suggesting).   \nSection 8 highlights the need for the Agency to issue guidance on certain fundamental issues \nrelated to aerosols, in addition to issui ng the universal waste rule , and Section 9 provides a brief \nconclusion.   Finally, we once again commend the Agency for this process and reiterate the \ncommitment of the Retail Associations to continuing to work with EPA to develop common \nsense regulations t hat protect our customers and the environment while not overburdening \nbusinesses with red tape and compliance costs.  \n \n2. Summary of Comments  \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes as universal wastes.  As discussed in Section 3 below, the Retail Associations \nrepresent a broad cross section of the retail industry \u2013 the economic sector that EPA recogniz es \nas having the largest percentage of entities affected by this rulemaking \u2013 and thus ha ve a strong \ninterest in the Agency\u2019s universal waste proposal.  We have been urging EPA to take this type of \naction for several years, and are pleased that the Agency has initiated the current rulemaking.  As \ndiscussed more fully in Section 4 below, we believe aerosol cans are particularly well suited for \naddition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all of the criteria specified in the \nregulations for classi fication as universal wastes.  For example, they are generated ubiquitously, \npose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated and non -regulated streams, and \nwould be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA hazardous waste r egulations \nwere not applied during generation, storage, transport, and collection.  In addition, they have \nbeen successfully managed as universal wastes in several states for many years.  \n \nWe are concerned, however, that the scope of the proposal has been unnecessarily and \ninappropriately narrowed in certain ways that would make the universal waste rule unworkable, \nespecially in the retail sector  (which EPA estimates represent s approximate two -thirds of the \naffected generator universe) .  In particular, as d iscussed in Section 5 below, the proposed rule \nwould require generators to make fine technical judgments about each individual aerosol can  in \norder to determine whether it can be managed as a universal waste .  Some of these technical \njudgments include : \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n \no Whether t he can  dispenses chemical products in the form of a foam or spray  (eligible for \nmanagement as a universal waste) or in the form of a gel or paste  (potentially not \neligible);  \n \no Whether the can expels only gas (potentially not eligible) or also exp els a solid or liquid \n(eligible);  \n \no Whether any dried spray, splatters, or drips o n the outside a re evidence of leakage \n(potentially not eligible) or simply usage (eligible); and  \n \no Whether the can is both \u201cempty\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d (in which case it might n ot be eligible), \neven though EPA has repeatedly said that it cannot clearly define when an aerosol can is \nempty or reactive.  \n \nWe question whether any generator could confidently make these types of judgments .  In any \nevent, in the retail sector, drawing a ll these distinctions would be hopelessly impractical, given \nthe extremely wide range of aerosol products being handled, the significant numbers of waste \naerosol cans  being generated , the limited experience o f most retail employees with these types of \nissues, and the high turnover of retail personnel.  Moreover, EPA has long maintained that one of \nthe key advantages of the universal waste rule is that it obviates the need for distinguishing \nbetween look-alike products.  For these reasons and others discusse d in Section 5, we urge the \nAgency  to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated products and gas -only \nproducts, by removing or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leaking or \ndamage, and by clarifying the status of empt y aerosol cans.   \n \nEPA  should also clarify that as soon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may \nimmediately be transported in all states without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste \ntransporter  \u2013 regardless of if/when the s tates adopt the universal waste rule .  As discussed in \nSection 6, even though states generally have the authority to impose hazardous waste rules that \nare more stringent than the federal regulations, they are preempted from imposing more stringent \nrules with respect to transport of hazardous wastes, as a result of the explicit preemption \nprovisions of the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act .  Clarifying this point would go \na long way toward accelerating and maximizing the benefits of the universal waste rule, \nespecially for companies that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes in multiple states ( e.g., \nnationwide or regional retailers)  and/or need or want to transport such wastes across state lines to \nan environmentally sound recycling or disposal facility.   EPA should also, as it has with other \nuniversal waste rules, encourage states to adopt the final rule and issue guidance specifying that \nthe Agency will not take enforcement actions involvi ng aerosol can universal wastes that are \nmanaged in compliance with the universal waste rule, regardless of whether the state has adopted \nthe rule or received authorization for the rule.     \n       \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings th at would result from the rule are likely \nfar greater than EPA estimated in its R egulatory Impact Analysis \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 \nmillion per year or more.  As discussed in Section 7 below, the Agency \u2019s primary methodology \nfor estimating the cost savings  was fundamentally flawed, in large part because it assumed that \n \n- 4 - \n \n \nretail stores (the largest category of affected generators) are similar to manufacturing facilities in \nthat only a very small percentage are likely to have their \u201cgenerator status \u201d (i.e., their status as \nLarge, Small, or Very Small Quantity Generator s) change as a result of the universal waste rule.  \nIn fact, however, the rule is likely to have a substantial effect on the generator status of retail \nfacilities ( e.g., stores, distribution center s, and return centers), since they commonly generate \nrelatively low volumes of hazardous wastes, and hazardous aerosol can wastes represent a \nsubstantial percentage  of such wastes .  Indeed, this is why the Retail Associations have been \nadvocating so strong ly over the last several years for a universal waste rule for aerosols.          \n \nFinally, t o further improv e the regulatory framework for aerosol cans,  we also urge the Agency \nto move forward on its separate commitment to issue guidance on when aerosol ca ns are subject \nto hazardous waste regulation in the first instance.  In particular, as discussed in Section 8 below, \nwe ask EPA to clarify (a) that aerosol cans destined for recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that \naerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of reactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty \nonce they are no longer capable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way \nas required for the intended application , and (d) that  generators may use statistical information to \ndetermine the quantity of aerosol cans that need to be counted in determining their hazardous \nwaste generator status .  EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final \nuniversal waste ru le, if that can be done without delaying the universal waste rule.   However, the \nfirst priority should be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, \nwhich can be followed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.  In any event, the Retail \nAssociations would welcome the opportunity to work with the Agency to ensure that the \nguidance encourages environmental sound management of used aerosols without imposing \nundue burdens on the regulated community.    \n \n3.  The Retail Associa tions and Their  Interest in This Rulemaking  \n  \nThe Retail Associations represent a broad cross section of the retail sector in the United States, \nincluding large and small companies, from chains with more than a thousand stores nationwide \nto regional compan ies with a handful of stores.   The vast majority of the members of each of the \nAssociations market aerosol products, have the potential to generate hazardous aerosol can \nwastes (as discussed further below), and therefore have a strong interest in the curre nt \nrulemaking.  Each of the individual Associations is described briefly below:  \n \no RILA is an organization of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative retailer and \nsupplier companies \u2013 the leaders of the retail industry.  RILA members represent more \nthan $1.5 trillion in annual sales and operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing \nfacilities, and distribution centers nationwide.  Our member retailers and suppliers have \nfacilities in all 50 states and the District of Col umbia, as well as internationally, and \nemploy millions of workers domestically and worldwide.  \n \no FMI proudly advocates on behalf of the food retail industry, which employs nearly 5 \nmillion workers and represents a combined annual sales volume of almost  $800 \nbillion.   FMI member companies operate nearly 33,000 retail food stores and 12,000 \npharmacies.   FMI membership includes the entire spectrum of food retail venues : single \n \n- 5 - \n \n \nowner grocery stores, large multi -store supermarket chains, pharmacies, online and \nmixed retail stores.

In addition, FMI has almost 500 associate \nmember companies that provide products and services to the food retail industry.     \n \no NACDS represents traditional drug stores, supermarkets , and mass merchants with \npharmacies.

NACDS members also include more than 900 supplier partners and over \n70 international members representing 20 countries.  \n \nThe Retail Associations and their members have a clear and strong interest in this rulemaking.  \nIndeed, EPA, in the pre amble to the proposal , stated that \u201c[the] economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the \nlargest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade industry \u2026 representing \n65% of the affected Large Quantity Generator universe.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Retailers, \nincluding members  of the Associations , market an extremely wide range of aerosol products, \nincluding but not limited to the following:  \n \n\uf0a7 Adhesives  \n\uf0a7 Air fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Air horn s \n\uf0a7 Antifungal treatments  \n\uf0a7 Antistatic agents  \n\uf0a7 Artificial snow  \n\uf0a7 Bathroom cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Carpet cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Cooking oils  \n\uf0a7 Cheese  \n\uf0a7 Deodorants  \n\uf0a7 Disinfectants  \n\uf0a7 Engine degreasers  \n\uf0a7 Fabric fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Fabric protectors  \n\uf0a7 First aid products  \n\uf0a7 Floor cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Foam insulation  \uf0a7 Furniture polishes  \n\uf0a7 Hair styling products  \n\uf0a7 Lubricants  \n\uf0a7 Novelties  \n\uf0a7 Oven cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Paints  \n\uf0a7 Perfumes  \n\uf0a7 Pesticides  \n\uf0a7 Shaving creams  \n\uf0a7 Starter fluids  \n\uf0a7 Sealants  \n\uf0a7 Spot removers  \n\uf0a7 Starch  \n\uf0a7 Sunscreens  \n\uf0a7 Tanning products  \n\uf0a7 Varnishes  \n\uf0a7 Waterproofing treatments  \n\uf0a7 Whipped dessert toppings  \n \nOf course, the vast majority of aerosols handled by retailers are not wastes in their hands, but \nrather are sold to customers and ultimately disposed or recycled (after use) by the customers.  \nNevertheless, significan t amounts are either returned by customers or are unsold due to various \n \n- 6 - \n \n \nreasons ( e.g., damage, defect, recall, obsolescence, expiration, seasonal product changes, or \nremoval from shelves due to failure to \u201csell through\u201d at an acceptable rate).  Most of the se \nunsold/returned items are not wastes, because they are suitable for re -shelving, liquidation sale \nthrough a secondary market, donation to non -profit organizations, or shipment to a manufacturer \nor its agent for credit.  In some instances, however, the u nsold/returned aerosol products do \nbecome wastes, and depending upon their composition, may be classified as hazardous wastes.  \nMembers of the Retail Associations have reported that aerosols represent up to 50% (by weight) \nor even more of all the potential ly hazardous unsold/returned products that they handle.   \nRetailers may also generate smaller amounts of aerosol can wastes in other ways, such as \nthrough cleaning/maintenance of buildings, equipment, and vehicles, constructing product \ndisplays, preparing f oods and beverages, providing various services to customers, and \nconducting routine office/administrative functions.   In light of all these potential mechanisms for \ngenerating hazardous aerosol can wastes, the Retail Associations , their members, and the re tail \nsector more broadly, have a strong interest in the current rulemaking.                   \n \n4. The Retail Associations  Strongly Support the Classification and Regulation of \nHazardous Aerosol Can Wastes as Universal Wastes   \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the addition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the \nRCRA universal waste rule.  Indeed, the Associations have been urging the Agency take this step \nfor several years, such as in comments submitted together with another retail sector trade \nassociation ( i.e., the National Retail Federation) on EPA\u2019s 2014 Notice of Data Availability \n(\u201cNODA\u201d) on the application of RCRA to retailers.  See Comments of the Retail Associations in \nResponse to EPA\u2019s NODA on the Application of RCRA to the Retail Indus try (May 30, 2014)  \n(EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-RCRA -2012 -0426 -0038)  (\u201cRetail Associations NODA Comments\u201d) \n(Attachment 1 to the current comments) at 26 -31.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , also \nencouraged EPA to adopt a universal waste rule for aerosol c an wastes as part of t he Agency\u2019s \nregulatory reform efforts under Executive Order 13777.  See Comments of the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association on EPA\u2019s Request for Public Comment on \u201c Evaluation of Existing \nRegulations\u201d (May 15, 2017)  (EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-2017 -0190 -32612)  (\u201cRILA Regulatory \nReform Comments\u201d)  (Attachment 2) at 8-13.     \n \nEPA has presented a compelling case for classification of hazardous aerosol can wastes as \nuniversal wastes in the preamble to the current proposal.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 1 1,658 -59.  \nHowever, w e provide below some additional support demonstrating that aerosol cans meet each \nof the criteria set forth in the RCRA regulations for additions to the list of universal wastes.1  In \nshort, aerosol cans are perfectly suited for manage ment under the u niversal waste  program since \nthey are generated ubiquitously, pose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated \nand non -regulated streams, and would be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA \nhazardous waste regulations were not applied during generation, collection, and transport.  \nMoreover, a number of states (including environmental leaders such as California and Colorado ) \n                                                 \n1  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81.   It is worth noting that EPA has stressed that \u201cit does not believe that each and \nevery factor must be met in order for a waste to be appropriate for the universal waste system, and for regulation of \nthe waste under part 273 to improve waste management an d implementation.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,513  \n(May 11, 1995)  (stating further that \u201cthe Agency will make decisions based on the weight of the evidence\u201d).   \n \n- 7 - \n \n \nhave long classified and regulated aerosol cans as universal wastes, and their programs for doing \nso appear to have been highly successful.   \n \no CRITERION #1:   The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of \ngenerators, is listed in subpa rt D of part 261 of this chapter, or (if not listed) a \nproportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste \nidentified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(a)]   \n \n As EPA notes in the preamble to t he proposal, aerosol cans may exhibit the RCRA \ncharacteristic of ignitability if they contain flammable propellants such as propane or \nbutane.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,656.  In addition, discarded aerosol cans may be \nhazardous if they contain commercial che mical products that either exhibit a hazardous \ncharacteristic or are listed as hazardous wastes.  Id.   While in many instances it may be \ndifficult for a generator to determine if the aerosol can wastes it generates are hazardous \nor not, there can be no do ubt that many  waste aerosol cans  are hazardous.      \n \n Of course, many \u2013 perhaps even most \u2013 aerosol cans are not hazardous .  Nevertheless, \nhazardous aerosol  can waste s can and should still be designated as universal wastes.  \nIndeed, EPA has long recognized  that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule \nis that it \u201celiminates [the need for] identifying, documenting, and keeping separate \nregulated waste and unregulated waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,513.  The Agency noted \nthat it \u201cwishes to encoura ge persons to manage both regulated waste and unregulated \nwaste in the same collection systems \u2026 [a]s long as all commingled waste is managed in \na system that meets the requirements of the universal waste regulations.\u201d  Id.  EPA \nindicated that this approac h was particularly attractive in situations where \u201can across the \nboard hazardous waste determination [could not be made] for entire categories of waste\u201d \nand/or where a waste \u201ceither becomes hazardous or is no longer hazardous due to \nchanges in manufacturin g practices [or product composition].\u201d  Id.  Given the difficulty \nin determining which waste aerosols are hazardous and which are not, they seem to be an \nideal candidate for designation as universal wastes.  \n \no CRITERION #2:   The waste or category of waste  is not exclusive to a specific industry \nor group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of \nestablishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, \noffice complexes, conditionally exempt small quantity  generators, small businesses, \ngovernment organizations, as well as large industrial facilities).  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.81(b)]  \n \n As discussed above, the retail industry handle s a significant amount of unsold/returned \naerosol cans.  However, a much larger quant ity of waste aerosol cans are generated by the \npersons and entities that purchase and use aerosol products.  Households are by far \n \n- 8 - \n \n \ncollectively the largest generators of such wastes.2  However, a wide variety of \nbusinesses generate  aerosol wastes , as well,  by using the products.    \n \n In the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule, EPA identifies 18 industries \nwith large and small quantity generators that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes.  See \n83 Fed. Reg. at 11,638.  However, we believe that the range of generators of such wastes \nis much broader.   For example, vehicle fleet owners and service centers commonly use \naerosol lubricants, paints, sealants, and the like, and the same is true for virtually anyone \nwho owns or services industrial equipment.  Office buildings and cleaning services use a \nvariety of aerosol cleaning products for both hard surfaces ( e.g., wood polish, bathroom \ncleaners, etc.) and fabric surfaces ( e.g., carpet cleaners and upholstery fresheners).  \nHealthcare facilities use aerosol disinfectants.  Exterminators and businesses with pest \ncontrol problems use aerosol pesticides.  Hair salons use aerosol hair sprays, styling gels, \nand the like.  Laundries and dry cleaners use aerosol spot removers and fabric protectors.  \nRestaurants use aerosol cooking sprays, and other food products.  The list of businesses, \nlarge and small, that use products dispensed with aerosol cans and generate the cans as \nwastes is almost endless.  Moreover, federal, state, and local government agencies  are \nalso major users and generators of aerosols, inasmuch as they operate large office \nbuildings, infrastructure facilities, healthcare centers, schools, parks, and facilities where \nlarge numbers of individuals are housed ( e.g., military installations and  prisons).  \nAlthough most of these commercial /government users of products in aerosol cans are not \nrequired to handle the used cans as hazardous wastes ( e.g., because they qualify as Very \nSmall Quantity Generators (\u201c VSQGs \u201d)), they collectively constitute a  major portion of \nthe used aerosol can stream.  \n \n Clearly, waste  aerosol cans are generated ubiquitously in an extremely wide range of \nsettings, both industrial and not.  This fact makes them ideal candidates for the universal \nwaste rule.  EPA has long str essed that \u201c[o]ne of the problems the universal waste rule is \ndesigned to address is that a relatively large portion of some waste types are exempt from \nthe hazardous waste regulations ( i.e., are generated by households and CESQGs  [i.e., \nConditionally Exem pt Small Quantity Generators] ) and are indistinguishable from the \nregulated portion of the waste.  This \u2018look alike\u2019 problem makes implementation of the \n[standard RCRA] program for these wastes extremely difficult.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at \n25,514.  Aerosol ca ns appear to be precisely the type of material that EPA had in mind.  \nA large proportion of aerosol cans are generated as wastes by exempt household s and \nVSQGs, but regulated entities generate a substantial amount of aerosol wastes, as well, \nand such waste s are typically indistinguishable from the aerosols generated by exempt \npersons.             \n \n \n                                                 \n2  See, e.g. , European Aerosol Federation, \u201cAnnual Report 2017\u201d (Attachment 3) at 17 (indicati ng that 55.5% \nof aerosol products produced in Europe are personal care products, and an additional 20.7% are household \nproducts).   \n \n- 9 - \n \n \no CRITERION #3:   The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of \ngenerators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in re latively \nsmall quantities by each generator.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c)]  \n \n Virtually all households in the U.S. can be expected to generate at least some waste \naerosol cans.  That alone accounts for approximately 100 million generators, making the \nwastes amon g the most  common potentially hazardous wastes generated in the country.  \nAlthough these generators would be excluded from regulation under the household waste \nexclusion, the numbers of business, government, and other institutional generators that \nare pote ntially regulated (unless they qualify as VSQGs) is similarly very large.  The \nRetail Associations estimate that the number of retail establishments in the United States \nhandling unsold/returned aerosols is likely well over 100,000 (based on Census data on  \nthe number of retailers i n key sectors that can be expected to market (and thus handle \nunsold/returned) aerosol products ).3  We have not made an effort to quantify the number \nof generating establishments in other industries, but given the wide range of su ch \nindustries (as noted above), it seems almost certain that the numbers of such generators \nwould be in the millions.   \n \n The amounts generated by each generator likely vary substantially.  Members of the \nRetail Associations report that individual stores often handle up to 1000 lbs/year of \nunsold/returned aerosol cans.  Each household user of aerosols presumably generates a \nfairly limited number of waste aerosol cans each month or year.  Business users of \naerosol products may generate somewhat larger amount s, depending upon their size and \nthe nature of their operations.  However, it might reasonably be expected that if a facility \nrequires a very large amount of a particular chemical product, it might be more likely to \nuse a different means of application.  F or example, a facility that uses large quantities of \nspray paint would likely obtain a bulk liquid paint that could be aerosolized using \ncompressed gas, rather than using individual aerosol cans.  Accordingly, it appears that \nwaste aerosol cans are generat ed by large numbers of generators, most commonly in \nrelatively small quantities.          \n \no CRITERION #4:   Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste \n(including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship \nof the waste.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(d)]  \n \n EPA has stated that \u201cthe goal of this factor is to facilitate addition of wastes to the \nuniversal waste system that are most likely to be collected, and to be collected in a \nmanner that ensures good mana gement of the waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,514.  The \nRetail Associations believe that aerosol cans are precisely the type of materials that EPA \nhad in mind.  As an initial matter, aerosol cans constitute a large stream that is readily \n                                                 \n3  See U.S. Census Bureau, \u201cStatistical Abstract of the United States: 2012,\u201d Table 1048 (data as of 2008) \n(Attachment 4) (indicating that there are 114,100 gasoline stations, 63,400 supermarkets and grocery stores, 25,700 \nconvenience stores, 56,100 automotive parts/accessories/tire stores, 42,000 pharmacies and drug stores, 23,000 \nhome centers and hardware stores, 22,100 sport ing goods stores, 19,800 lawn and garden stores, 14,000 \ncosmetics/beauty supplies/perfume stores, and 4,400 warehouse clubs and superstores).   \n \n- 10 - \n \n \nidentifiable and e asy to segregate for special management.  Indeed, many of the key \nelements needed for proper stewardship of this waste stream are already in place.  \nAccording to a study organized by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition  (\u201cSPC\u201d) , \napproximately 70% of America ns have access to curbside or drop -off recycling facilities \nthat accept aluminum or steel aerosol cans.  See SPC, \u201c2015 -16 Centralized Study on \nAvailability of Recycling for Aerosol Containers\u201d (Attachment 5).  In addition, several \nmajor waste services pro viders have developed and are marketing programs for collecting \nand recycling waste aerosol cans from consumer and/or business generators.   \n \n Notwithstanding these efforts, it appears that vast quantities of aerosol cans are simply \nbeing disposed of by co nsumers in the ordinary trash.  Designating aerosol cans as \nuniversal wastes would significantly facilitate collection and recycling programs, and \nwould encourage use  of such programs .4  The requirements of the universal waste rule \nwould also ensure that t hese activities are performed in a manner that is protective of \nhuman health and the environment.              \n \no CRITERION #5:   The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during \naccumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardou s wastes, and \nspecific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appropriate to be added to 40 CFR 273.13, 273.33, and \n273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be \nprotective of human health and the environment during accumulation and transport.   \n[40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e)]  \n \n Waste  or unsold/returned aerosol cans present relatively low risks during accumulation \nand transport.  As an initial matter, these aerosol cans are the same as the aerosol cans \nthat are distributed and used regularly by households and businesses of virtually every \ntype, except that they generally contain significantly less of the propellant and chemical \nproduct than the unused items.  Moreover, as not ed above, over half of all aerosol wastes \nappear to be generated by households, and are frequently disposed of in the ordinary \ntrash.   \n \n It is particularly noteworthy that aerosol cans are not \u201cnaked\u201d chemicals, as might be the \ncase, for example, with bul k pesticides (some of which are already classified as universal \nwastes).  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.3 (classifying certain pesticides as universal wastes).  \nRather, aerosols by their very nature are engineered devices  \u2013 devices  that by law must \nmeet U.S. Departm ent of Transport (\u201c DOT \u201d) requirements for design, filling, testing, \n                                                 \n4  As just one example, in states that regulate household hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes once they are \ncollected, the universal waste rule would enable collected household hazardous aerosol can wastes to be stored at the \ncollection site and transported to an ultimate recycling/disposal facility in accordance with the universal waste \nrequirements, rather than t he full hazardous waste regulations.  See Rhode Island Rules and Regulation for \nHazardous Waste Management, Rule 5.1(b)(1) (\u201cowners and/or operators of facilities that accept household \nhazardous waste \u2026 shall comply with the requirements for Large Quantity  Generators \u2026 and upon receipt the \nhousehold hazardous waste shall be subject to full regulation as hazardous waste\u201d); Minnesota Admin. R. \n7045.0310(3) (\u201cAn operator who establishes or operates all or part of a household hazardous waste management \nprogram must comply with the standards applicable to large quantity generators [with limited exceptions]\u201d).    \n \n- 11 - \n \n \nability to withstand heat and shock, etc.  See generally 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3).  These \nrequirements help minimize risks during both accumulation and transport.  Moreover, \nduring transp ort, the used aerosols, like unused aerosols, are subject to additional DOT \ncontrols.  For example, the aerosols must be packed in strong outer packagings, which \namong other things, must meet general packaging requirements for protectiveness.  See \n49 C.F.R . \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(iv) and 171.8 (defining \u201cstrong outer packaging\u201d).  In addition, \nthe outer packagings must be specially marked.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(i).  As EPA \nnotes in the preamble to the proposal, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,658, local fire codes also \nprovide comprehensive protections during storage of aerosols ( e.g., package markings, \nstorage quantity limits, design of storage areas, fire alarm systems, fire protection \nsystems such as sprinklers, etc.).  See, e.g. , National Fire Protection Association \n(\u201cNFPA \u201d) Fire Code (2018), Chapter 61 (Aerosol Products) (Attachment 6).  These DOT \nand fire code requirements should obviate the need for further regulation during \naccumulation and transport.      \n \n To the extent that any additional regulation might be  warranted, the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rules should be sufficient.  They require that the wastes be stored in a \nprotective manner, that containers be labeled and marked to indicate their contents, that \nemployees be trained, that any releases b e addressed appropriately, and that the wastes be \nsent to a properly authorized facility in a timely fashion.  In addition, if a facility \ngenerates or accumulates large quantities, they must notify EPA and track all shipments \nof the waste into and out of t he facility.  These safeguards have proven highly effective \nfor other universal wastes, and the Retail Associations  believe they would likewise be \neffective for aerosol cans (as demonstrated in California , Colorado , and other states, as \ndiscussed below in the context of Criterion #8 ).         \n \no CRITERION #6:   Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted from non -hazardous waste \nmanagement systems (e.g., the municipal waste s tream, non -hazardous industrial or \ncommercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, \ntreatment, or disposal in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(f)]  \n \n The determination of whether individual aerosol cans a re wastes or non -wastes, and \nhazardous or non -hazardous, can be extremely difficult.   See generally  Retail \nAssociations NODA Comments at 17 -20.  With so many generators in so many different \nindustries, many of which do not generally handle hazardous wastes  and thus are \nparticularly unsuited to making a proper determination, it is almost inevitable that \nmistakes will be made.  Indeed, some generators may not even be aware of the need to \nmake a determination or the possible implications of a hazardous waste d etermination.  \nThis is especially true given that the waste aerosol cans are in many cases identical to, or \nat least similar to, the products that business employees use and discard at their \nhouseholds and therefore are excluded from RCRA regulation.  Thus , it seems likely that \nlarge numbers of generators of potentially hazardous aerosol cans are routinely disposing \nof such products in the ordinary trash.  \n \n \n- 12 - \n \n \n Regulating aerosol cans as universal wastes would significantly reduce this problem.  As \nEPA noted in the final rule designating lamps as universal wastes, \u201cthe streamlined \nrequirements of the universal waste program will give [unsophisticated] generators a \nmore accessible starting point for good environmental management.  If regulatory \nrequirements are simpler, \u2026 more hazardous waste[s] will be handled properly \u2026 \ninstead of going to solid waste landfills or to municipal waste combustors.  Improved \nmanageme nt will \u2026 lead to a reduction in the total amount of hazardous waste emissions \nto the environment.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. 36,466, 36,473 (July 6, 1999).   \n \n Moreover, regulating waste aerosol cans as universal waste s would encourage better \nmanagement of such w astes by more sophisticated generators.  For example, such \ngenerators would have less reason to try drawing fine distinctions between used aerosol \ncans that are wastes versus non -wastes, or hazardous versus non -hazardous.  Many \ngenerators \u2013 perhaps most \u2013 would simply direct all their used aerosol cans through the \nuniversal waste system.  EPA has previously acknowledged that this type of result can be \nan important reason for designating wastes as universal.5  Moreover, a universal waste \ndesignation would fa cilitate consolidation of waste aerosol cans from multiple facilities \nand/or generators, which in turn would provide economies of scale that would likely \nmake recycling options more viable.6                \n \no CRITERION #7:   Regulation of the waste or categ ory of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory \nprogram.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(g)]  \n \n Designating aerosol cans as universal wastes would not only encourage environmentally \npreferred outcome s, as noted above, but would also improve implementation and \ncompliance.  Not only would generators generally be relieved of the requirement to \nassess whether individual cans are wastes or non -wastes, and hazardous or non -\nhazardous, but the same would be t rue for federal and state inspection and enforcement \npersonnel.  Thus, implementation would certainly be improved.  Moreover, as EPA has \nnoted, \u201c[i]f regulatory requirements are simpler [as a result of a universal waste rule], the \ncompliance rate will impr ove.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 36,473; see also  70 Fed. Reg. at \n45,511 (\u201cadding [waste] to the universal waste rule will improve compliance with the \nhazardous waste regulations by making it more achievable\u201d).     \n \n                                                 \n5  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,515 (\u201cdiversion of unregulated portions of a waste \u2026 from non -hazardous \nmanagement systems could be a reason to add a waste to the universal waste system.  For example, in some cases it \nmay be likely that facilitating the collection of commingled regulated and unregulated waste would encourage \ndevelopment of collection systems that could divert significant quantities of the waste,  including unregulated waste, \nfrom non -hazardous waste management systems\u201d).   \n \n6  Cf. 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,511 (August 5, 2005) (a universal waste designation \u201cwill allow generators \u2026 \nto send [their wastes] to a central consolidation point. \u2026  Under th e universal waste rule, a handler of universal \nwaste can send the universal waste to another handler, where it can be consolidated into a larger shipment for \ntransport to a [recycling] facility\u201d).  \n \n \n- 13 - \n \n \no CRITERION #8:  Such o ther factors as may be appropriate.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81( h)] \n  \n As EPA notes in the proposal, the fact that aerosol can wastes have successfully been \nmanaged as universal wastes under existing programs ( e.g., in California and Colorado) \n\u201cweighs in favor of concluding that manage ment of aerosol cans under the federal \nuniversal waste regulations is likely to be successful.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,659.  \nHowever, the Agency has understated the extent to which aerosols are already being \nmanaged as universal wastes.   \n \n At the present  time, a total of six states allow aerosol can wastes in general to be handled \nas universal wastes.7  Moreover, additional states allow particular categories of aerosol \ncan wastes ( e.g., aerosol paint wastes  or pharmaceutical aerosol wastes ) to be managed as \nuniversal wastes.8  Indeed, even the federal universal waste rule appears to cover aerosol \npesticide wastes  in some circumstances.  See 40 C.F.R.  \u00a7 273.3 (covering, for example, \nunused pesticide products that are collected and managed as part of a waste  pesticide \ncollection program).  As far as we are aware, all of these programs have been successful \nin facilitating the proper management of the aerosol can wastes that they cover.   \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above and in the preamble for the propos ed rule , aerosol cans are \nideal candidates for inclusion in the universal waste rule.  Such a change would be of substantial \nbenefit to the retail industry, but would also benefit a host of other business, government, and \nother institutional generators of aerosol wastes, as well as federal and state environmental \nagencies.  We therefore urge EPA to finalize the proposed rule (with the changes and \nclarifications discussed in detail below) as soon as p ossible . \n \n5. EPA Should Modify the Scope of the Universal Waste Rule for Hazardous A erosol \nCan Wastes to Ensure the Rule Is Workable and Provides Maximum Benefits  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  are strongly supportive of adding hazardous aerosol can wastes \nto the universal waste rule, we are concerned that EPA \u2019s proposal unnecessarily and \ninappropriately limits the scope of the rule by (a) narrowly defining the term \u201caerosol can,\u201d (b) \nexcluding aerosol cans with \u201cevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage,\u201d and (c) including an \nexclusion for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans that is expressed in a manner that may cause some to believe \n                                                 \n7  See California Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16; 6 Color ado Code Regs. 1007 -3, Section 273.2(d); New \nMexico Admin.

Code 7:26A -1.3 (defining universal wastes to include oil -based finishes, and \ndefinin g oil-based finishes to include \u201caerosol paint cans\u201d); 25 Pennsylvania Admin.

Code \u00a7 335.262 (classifying and regulating \u201cpaint and paint -related wastes\u201d as \nuniversal wastes); Michigan R. 335.262 (classifying and regulating pharmaceutical wastes as universal wastes); \nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality, \u201cUniversal Waste Ph armaceutical s\u201d (July 2012) (Attachment 8) \n(\u201cUniversal Waste Pharmaceuticals \u2026 may be liquid, solid, paste, or aerosol \u201d (emphasis added)).   \n \n- 14 - \n \n \nthat certain empty aerosol cans are ineligible for management as universal wastes.  As discussed \nbelow, these limits have no rational basis .  In addition, by requiring generators to make fine \ntechnical judgments about each individual aerosol can that they generate as wastes, these limits \nwould render the universal waste rule unworkable, especially in the retail sector (which EPA \nestimates represents approximately two -thirds of the affected generat or universe).   This is one of \nthe things that the universal waste rule was specifically designed to avoid.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. \nReg. at 25,513 ( stating that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule is that it \n\u201celiminates [the need for] identifyin g, documenting, and keeping separate regulated waste and \nunregulated waste\u201d ).  Accordingly, we urge EPA to eliminate these limitations in the final rule.    \n \n 5.1 Definition of Aerosol  \n \nUnder the proposed rule, an aerosol can would be defined as \u201can intact container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray \nor foam.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,664  (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 260.10 and \n273.9).  As discussed below, the Retail Associations  are concerned that this definition is \nunnecessarily and inappropriately narrow, and that it would complicate and potentially \nundermine implementation of the universal waste rul e.  Accordingly, we request that EPA \nexpand the definition, for example by aligning it with the corresponding definition under \ninternational dangerous goods regulations.  We also request that EPA delete the reference to \n\u201cintact,\u201d because it is unnecessary and likely to create confusion, especially in light of the \nseparate proposed exclusion for aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage \nthat could cause leakage (discussed further below).    \n \nThe proposed definition would exclude two sig nificant categories of products commonly viewed \nas aerosol products, each of which is discussed separately below:  \n \n(1) Products that use compressed/liquefied gas to expel materials without aerating them or \nproducing a spray or foam  \u2013 Common examples of pro ducts in this category that might \nbe found in a retail store would include cans of shaving gel, \u201cspray\u201d cheese, and novelty \nplastic string streamers.  There is no apparent reason for excluding these types of \nproducts from the universal waste rule.  Indeed,  the DOT Hazardous Materials \nRegulations (\u201cHMR\u201d) classify these products as aerosols and regulate them in the same \nmanner as products that aerate materials and produce sprays or foams.9  Similarly, the \nNFPA defines an aerosol container in a way that is independent of whether the material \nbeing dispensed is aerated or produces a spray o r foam.10  Accordingly, we believe that \nthe universal waste rule should similarly cover these products.  \n \n                                                 \n9  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.8 (defining an aerosol as \u201can article consisting of any non -refillable receptacle \ncontaining a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a \u2026 liquid, \npaste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device allowing the contents to be ejected by the gas\u201d).   \n \n10  See NFPA Code 30B, Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 (defining an aerosol container as a metal can or plastic \ncontainer that uses \u201cliquefied or compressed gas [to] expel[ ] the cont ents \u2026 when [a] valve is actuated\u201d).   \n \n \n- 15 - \n \n \n(2) Products that contain and expel only gas  \u2013 Common use examples of products in this \ncategory that might be found in a retail store would include  compressed gas dusters and \npneumatic horns.  The proposed regulatory definition of aerosol would not necessa rily \nexclude these products, since they are articles in which \u201cgas under pressure is used to \naerate and dispense any material [in this case the gas itself] through a valve in the form of \na spray .\u201d  However, the preamble to the proposal seems to indicate th at EPA intends to \nexclude gas -only products.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (\u201ccompressed gas canisters \u2026 \nwould not be included\u201d).  The only rationale the Agency gives is that these products \nallegedly \u201cpresent a greater risk than aerosol cans.\u201d   Id.  However, as far as we can tell, \nthere is no evidence of such increased risk.  Indeed, international rules for the transport of \ndangerous goods explicitly classify gas -only products as aerosols and regulate them in the \nsame way as aerosols that expel other materials .11  Moreover, under the existing DOT \nregulations, gas -only products are regulated in much the same way as aerosols, and DOT \nis currently considering a petition to align the definition of aerosol under the HMR with \nthe international definition in order to explicitly cover gas -only products.12  Accordingly, \nwe believe that these products pose essentially the same risks as products with gases that \nexpel other materials, and that they should therefore also be covered by the universal \nwaste rule.  \n \nNot only would the exclusion of these products be unnecessary and inappropriate, but it would \nalso substantially complicate and undermine implementation of the rule.  If these products are \nexcluded, generators and other handlers might effectively be required to inspect e ach and every \naerosol can to determine whether it is a non -aerating product or a gas -only product ineligible for \nmanagement as universal waste.  Failure to do so might require the generator/handler to handle \nall of its aerosol wastes as (non -universal) haz ardous wastes, which would render the universal \nwaste rule a nullity.  However, performing the inspection would be extremely challenging and \nmight even be a non -starter.  This is especially true in the retail sector, given the exceptionally \nbroad range of aerosol products carried by many stores, and the generally limited experience and \nhigh turnover of personnel in the sector.        \n \nIn the preamble to the proposal, EPA also states that the proposed definition would have the \nadvantage of \u201ckeep[ing] consist ency with the existing state [universal waste] programs [covering \naerosols].\u201d  However, two state universal waste programs already cover non -aerating products \n                                                 \n11  See, e.g. , United Nations Recommendations on Transport of Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations (\u201cUN \nModel Regulations\u201d), Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9) (\u201cAerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a \nnon-refillable receptacle \u2026 containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved under pressure, with or without a \nliquid, paste or powder , and fitted with a release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid \nparticles in suspension in a  gas, as a foam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state \u201d (emphasis \nadded)).   \n \n12  See 49 C.F.R. 173.306 (rules for limited quantities of compressed gases, including those in aerosol and \nnon-aerosol products); Petition of the Consumer Sp ecialty Products Association, the Council on Safe Transportation \nof Hazardous Articles, Inc., the National Aerosol Association, and the American Coatings Association to DOT \n(September 28, 2017) (Attachment 10) (stressing the safety of \u201cpure gas units used in consumer and industrial \n[applications]\u201d).   \n \n \n- 16 - \n \n \nand/or gas -only products.13  Moreover, as noted above, regulations that apply across the nation \nand/or internationally generally include these products.  Accordingly, the best way to maintain \nconsistency with existing regulatory regimes would be to define aerosol cans in a way that \nincludes non -aerating and gas -only products.    \n   \nIn light of the abov e, we urge EPA to change the proposed definition of aerosol can to enable \nnon-aerated and gas -only products to be managed as universal wastes, for example by adopting \nthe definition used in international dangerous goods regulations : \n \n   Aerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a  non-refillable receptacle \u2026 \nmade of metal, glass or plastics and containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved \nunder pressure, with or without a liquid, paste or powder, and fitted with a release device \nallowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a \nfoam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state . \n \nSee, e.g. , UN Model Regulations, Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9).   \n \nWe also urge EPA to delete the requirement that aerosol products be \u201cintact\u201d to be considered \naerosol cans.  This requirement seems unnecessary since the proposal includes a separate \nprovision (discussed further below) excluding aerosol cans that show evid ence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage that could cause leakage from the universal waste rule.  Moreover, inclusion \nof the word \u201cintact\u201d may cause significant confusion by raising questions as to whether the \nstandard for an intact aerosol can is different fr om the standard for determining whether an \naerosol can shows evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage (although \nthe preamble to the proposed rule indicates that the standards are meant to be the same, saying \nthat \u201c[t]hrough this ex clusion [for leaking/damaged aerosol cans], EPA intends that hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans that are not intact  continue to be subject to the full hazardous waste \nstandards,\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (emphasis added)).    \n \n 5.2 Exclusion for Leaking/Damage d Aerosols  \n      \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage \nunder reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d   See 52 Fed. Reg. a t 11,665 (proposed to be codified at \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)( 4)).  EPA claims that this exclusion is necessary because \u201cthe proposed \n[universal waste] management standards \u2026 rel[y] in part on the fact that the aerosol cans to be \nmanaged \u2026  are not leaking or otherwise damaged [in a way] where contents or propellants \ncould be dispersed \u2026 [or where there might be] an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  As \ndiscussed below, this exclusion is inconsistent with the current rules for other universal wastes, it \n                                                 \n13  See, e.g. , Ohio Admin. Code  3745 -273-09(A) (\u201c\u2018Aerosol container\u2019 means a non -opening, non -refillable \ncontainer that holds a substance under pressure and that can release the substance as a spray, gel, or foam by means \nof a propellant gas\u201d (emphasis added)); Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, \u201cUniversal Wastes\u201d (February 2018) \n(Publication w -hw4-62) (Attachment 11) (stating that aerosols \u201cmay \u2026 be managed as universal waste\u201d and \ndefining them as \u201cpressuriz ed containers used to dispense liquid  or gaseous  products\u201d (emphasis added)).   \n \n- 17 - \n \n \nis not necessary to protect human health and the environment, and it is so vague and potentially \nsusceptible to overly broad interpretation that it could potentially undermine the entire rule.  \n \nAs an initial matter, EPA\u2019s conclusion  about the need for this exclusion  is inconsistent with the \ncurrent rules for other universal wastes.  N one of the existing federal universal waste rules for \nother products exclude leaking or damaged products.  Instead, the rules simply require more \nprotec tive packaging for leaking/damaged products:  \n \no For batteries, handlers \u201cmust contain any universal waste battery that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions\u201d in a container that is \u201cc losed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents \nof the battery, and \u2026 lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions .\u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(a)(1) and \n273.33(a)(1).   \n \no Universal waste pesticides must be contained in a container that is \u201c closed, structurally \nsound, compatible with the pesticide, and that lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ,\u201d or in a \ncontain er that does not meet these standards ( e.g., a leaking container), \u201c provided that the \nunacceptable container is overpacked in a container that does meet the requirements .\u201d  \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( b)(1)-(2) and 273.33( b)(1)-(2).           \n \no Handler s of universal waste mercury -containing equipment \u201c must place in a container \nany [such] equipment with non -contained elemental mercury or that shows evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions ,\u201d and the container must be \u201cclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the device, must lack evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions, and must be reasonably designed \nto preve nt the escape of mercury into the environment by volatilization or any other \nmeans. \u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( c)(1) and 273.33( c)(1). \n \no With respect to universal waste lamps, handler s \u201cmust place in a container any lamp that \nshows evidence of breakage, le akage, or damage that could cause the release of mercury \nor other hazardous constituents to the environment ,\u201d and such c ontainers must be \u201cclosed, \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the lamps and must lack evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of mercury or other \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foreseeable conditions. \u201d   \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( d)(2) and 273.33( d)(2). \n \nEPA has provided no meaningful rationale for departing fr om this approach for aerosol cans.  \nNor do we believe any such rationale exists.  Just as with leaking/damaged batteries, pesticide \ncontainers (which may include some aerosol cans), mercury -containing equipment, and lamps, \nleaking/damaged aerosol cans can safely be managed as universal wastes if they are packaged in \nsuitably protective containers ( e.g., containers that are closed, structurally sound, compatible \nwith the contents of the aerosols, and lack evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could \n \n- 18 - \n \n \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ).  The use of protective containers is \nalready required for all aerosol cans under EPA\u2019s proposed rule.14  Thus, there is n o need to \nexclude leak ing/damaged aerosol cans.15 \n    \nMoreover, the criteria that E PA proposes for determining when aerosol cans would be excluded \nare so vague that they would create confusion in the regulated community and invite arbitrary \nenforcement by regulators, effectively undermining the benefits of the entire universal waste rule  \nfor aerosol cans.  We recognize that the criteria are similar to the standards that currently trigger \nmore protective packaging for other universal wastes ( i.e., whether the aerosol cans \u201c show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leak age under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions \u201d).  However, the criteria are uniquely problematic for aerosol cans, in part because \naerosol cans \u2013 unlike other universal waste items (with the exception of aerosol pesticides and \nperhaps some other types of pes ticide containers) \u2013 are designed specifically to disperse \nchemical products.  It is not uncommon for aerosol containers to have on the outside dried \nsplatters or drips of the chemical products they dispersed during use ( e.g., due to failure to shake \nthe cans properly prior to use, overspray in a confined area, backspray in a windy area, a \ndefective nozzle, or sputtering as the aerosol can neared the end of its useful life).  However, \nregulators or inspectors could potentially view such splatters or drips as \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage\u201d making the cans ineligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nIn addition, in the absence of certainty about how the splatters/drips will be viewed be regulators \nor inspectors, some generators/hand lers might conservatively assume that all aerosol cans \nbearing these marks should be handled as full y regulated  (non-universal) hazardous wastes.  \nBecause many, if not most, used cans will have such splatters/drips, the universal waste rule for \naerosol can s could effectively become unusable, thereby  undermining all the potential benefits of \nthe proposed rule . \n \nSimilar issues would arise in a variety of other situations.  Aerosol cans that are fully intact may \nnevertheless show evidence of corrosion \u2013 especi ally if the chemical products they contained and \ndispersed are corrosive ( e.g., certain cleaning products) and/or if they are stored for extended \nperiods in damp conditions.  Aerosol cans may also have missing actuator buttons, for a variety \nof reasons tha t have nothing to do with their basic structural integrity, such as that the actuators \nmay have fallen off ( e.g., if they were not attached correctly to begin with), they may have \ninadvertently been knocked off during handling or use, or they may have been  intentionally \nremoved ( e.g., under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(2)(iii) and 273.33(e)(2)(iii), which authorize \n                                                 \n14  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,666 (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(1) and 273.33(e)(1)) \n(proposing to require han dlers to accumulate universal waste aerosol cans \u201cin a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d).   \n \n15  Further protections for leaking/damage d aerosols are also provided by other regulatory regimes, such as the \nDOT hazardous materials transport regulations and local fire codes (as discussed generally in Section 4 above in the \ncontext of Criterion #5).  For example, the DOT rules require that ae rosols that are damaged, defective, or leaking to \nthe point where they do not meet applicable design standards must be transported in special aerosol salvage drums \nmarked \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE\u201d or \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE DRUM.\u201d  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(k)(2).  Inasmuch \nas DOT has determined that such salvage drums are protective during transport (including storage incidental to \ntransport), there is no reason to exclude these aerosol cans from the universal waste rule.           \n \n- 19 - \n \n \nhandlers to \u201c[r]emov[e] actuators to reduce the risk of accidental release \u201d).  In addition, intact \naerosols may be dented or scratched (more so than ot her universal wastes, like lamps which \nwould generally break rather dent, or batteries that do not have a gas -filled cavity and are more \nsolid/dense).  Any one of these conditions could potentially be viewed as \u201c leakage, spillage, or \ndamage \u201d under the prop osed rule, which might prevent the aerosol cans from being managed as \nuniversal wastes.  In this way, EPA\u2019s proposed exclusion has the potential to become the \nexclusion that swallows the entire rule.  \n \n 5.3 Exclusion for Empty Aerosols    \n \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that meet the standard for empty containers.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,66 5  \n(proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3) ).  EPA explains in the preamble that \u201c[a]n \naerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR 261.7 is not subject to \nhazardous waste regulation, and may be recycled as scrap metal.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  The Agency \nstates that the exclusion  applies to  \u201caerosol cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product).\u201d  Id.  The Retail Associations  have several concerns with this part of the \nproposal.  \n \nFirst, even though EPA states in the preamble that empty aerosol cans are \u201cnot subject to \nhazardous waste regulation,\u201d th e Agency in the past has indicated that empty aerosols might \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity and thus remain subject to hazardous waste regulation.  See \nEPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) (Attachment 12) \n(\u201cIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the aerosol cans [may] be a RCRA hazardous waste \nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  As discussed in Section 8  \nbelow, we do not believe that any aerosol cans \u2013 much less emp ty aerosol cans \u2013 qualify as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  However, if any empty aerosols are deemed to be reactive, the \nexclusion of empty cans from the universal waste rule could potentially be interpreted to mean \nthat such \u201creactive\u201d empty cans would have  to be managed as full y regulated (non-universal) \nhazardous wastes.16  Such a result would make no sense, given that full or partially full aerosol \n                                                 \n16  We note that t here is some uncertainty with respect to this point, because of the confusing way that the \nexclusions in proposed 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b) are structured.  That provision states that the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rule do not apply to aerosol cans tha t (1) are not wastes, (2) are non -hazardous, (3) are empty, or (4) \nshow evidence of leakage, spillage or damage.  It is our understanding that for the first two categories ( i.e., aerosol \ncans that are not waste or are non -hazardous), EPA\u2019s intent is that g enerators would not be required  to handle the \ncans as universal wastes, but would allowed  to do so (or to handle the cans completely outside the RCRA regulatory \nprogram).  On the other hand, for the last category ( i.e., cans with evidence of leaking or dam age), the Agency\u2019s \nintent apparently is that generators would be prohibited  from handling the cans as universal wastes (and would have \nto handle them as fully regulated hazardous wastes, assuming they are solid and hazardous wastes).  Thus, the \n\u201cexclusions \u201d for these categories apparently are intended to mean very different things.   \n \nFor aerosol cans that are empty and non -reactive (which, as noted above, we believe would include all empty cans), \nEPA presumably intends the exclusion to operate in the same manner as for the first two categories, i.e., to mean \nthat generators are not required  to handle the cans as universal wastes, but are allowed  to do so (or to handle the \ncans completely outside the RCRA regulatory program).  However, to the extent EPA may believe that any empty \naerosol cans are reactive (which, as noted above, we do not believe is the case), it seems unlikely that the Agency \nwould intend the exclusion to work the same way (since that would allow \u201creactive\u201d empty cans to be managed \n \n- 20 - \n \n \ncans exhibiting the reactivity characteristic (to the extent that any such cans might be deemed by \nEPA to be reactive) would be eligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nMoreover, if \u201creactive\u201d empty aerosol cans cannot be managed as universal wastes, retailers and \nother generators would have to identify and segregate such cans so that the rest cou ld be \nmanaged as universal wastes \u2013 an almost impossible task, especially given the lack of clarity \nabout what constitutes an empty aerosol and/or a reactive aerosol, as well as the generally limited \nexperience and high turnover of personnel in the retail sector.    \n \nWe doubt that EPA intended such results from its proposed exclusion of empty aerosols.  \nPerhaps the Agency intended its statement in the preamble that empty aerosols are \u201cnot subject \nto hazardous waste regulation\u201d to clarify that empty container s are not subject to regulation as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  If so, we support such a clarification, but ask EPA to make this point \nmore explicit, so as to avoid any potential confusion.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the \n1987 EPA guidance refe renced above did not actually conclude  that empty aerosols could be \nreactive, but rather responded to a question that was posed to the Agency assum ing that they \ncould be reactive.  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) \n(Attachm ent 12) (\u201c[W]ould aerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still  potentially reactive \nbecause of contained  propellant be  regulated as hazardous waste?\u201d).   Thus, a statement now that \nempty aerosol cans are not reactive would not actually reverse prior EPA guidance.  And, as \ndiscussed in Section 8  below, it would be supported by the fact that even full or partially full \naerosols are not properly viewed as reactive.   \n \nA second problem with EPA\u2019s proposal on empty aerosol cans is that it provides no clear \nstandard for when an aerosol can qualifies as empty such that it would be excluded from the \nuniversal waste rule.  The proposed regulatory exclusion covers \u201c[a]erosol c ans that meet the \nstandard for empty containers  under part [sic] 261.7.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,665  (proposed to \nbe codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3)) ; see also id . at 11,660 (addressing \u201c aerosol can [s] that \nmeet [ ] the definition of empty container in  40 CFR 261.7 \u201d).  However, EPA has long side -\nstepped the issue of when aerosol cans qualify as empty under Section 261.7, leaving generators \nwithout any meaningful standard to apply.17   \n \n                                                 \ncompletel y outside the RCRA regulatory program).  For these aerosol cans, EPA might intend the exclusion to \noperate in the same way as the exclusion for damaged/leaking aerosol cans, such that the \u201creactive\u201d empty cans \nwould have to be managed as fully regulated ha zardous wastes, rather than as universal wastes.  This is the potential \ninterpretation discussed in the main text above.  However, it is possible that EPA may intend the exclusion for \n\u201creactive\u201d empty cans to operate in yet a third (unspecified) way.         \n     \n17  See, e.g. , Letter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to John DiFazio, \nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11780)  (\u201cDenit Letter #1) \n(Attachment 13) (\u201cWe have \u2026 been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of \n\u2018empty\u2019 under 40 CFR 261.7.  \u2026 [I]f the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to determine whether they \nare \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria listed in 40 CF R 261.7. \u2026 However, in order to dispose of a can as non -hazardous \nwaste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to determine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7\u201d); \nLetter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Gregory L. Crawford, Vice President, \nRecycling Operations, Steel Recycling Institute (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11782) (\u201cDenit Letter #2) \n(Attachment 14) (same).   \n \n \n- 21 - \n \n \nMoreover, the preamble to the proposed rule further muddies an alread y muddy picture by \nintroducing a new standard for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans and conflating it with a standard previously \noffered by the Agency for entirely different purposes.  In particular, EPA states in the preamble \nthat the proposed exclusion covers \u201caeroso l cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product),\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660, even though this standard is not in the \nproposed regulatory text, has no precedent we are aware of, and leaves unanswered what it \nmeans to be emptie d of propellant and product.  In addition, EPA states in the preamble that \nempty aerosol cans as defined under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7 \u201cmay be recycled as scrap metal,\u201d even \nthough past Agency guidance states that the standard for recycling aerosol cans as scrap metal is \nwhether they \u201c contain a significant amount of  liquid ,\u201d not whether they meet the standard of \nempty in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7.  See, e.g. , Denit Letter #1 (\u201cif the [aerosol] cans are being recycled, \nit is not necessary to determine whether they are \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria in 40 CFR 261.7.  As \nlong as an aerosol can being recycled does not contain significant liquids, t he can is exempt as \nscrap metal\u201d); Denit Letter #2 (same).  Complicating matters even further, EPA has previously \nstated that one way  to ensure an aerosol can does not contain a significant amount of liquid is by \npuncturing and draining it, id., which  has left the misimpression in the minds of some  that this is \nthe only way  to achieve this standard.  And, by blurring the distinction between th e \u201cno \nsignificant liquids\u201d standard and the definition of empty container, EPA may be leaving the \nmisimpression that  the only way to render an aerosol can empty is by puncturing and draining it.   \n \nIn light of the above, the Retail Associations urge EPA to clarify that empty aerosol cans are not \nreactive and thus do not have to be managed as either universal or hazardou s wastes (although \nthey may be managed as universal wastes on a voluntary basis), and further to clarify when \naerosol cans qualify as empty (including, but not limited to the fact that emptying does not \nrequire puncturing and draining).   We elaborate furth er on the guidance needed on these and \nrelated issues in Section 8 below.  \n \n6. EPA Should Clarify That As Soon As It Finalizes the Proposed Rule, Aerosol Can \nWastes May Be Transported in All States Without a Hazardous Waste Manifest or \na Hazardous Waste Transporter  \n \nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA indicates that the designation of hazardous aerosol can \nwastes as universal wastes under the federal regulations would not take effect in authorized states \nunless and until such states adopted the same de signation under state law.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at \n11,662 -63.  Moreover, because such designation would generally make the state programs less \nstringent  than they currently are  (except in the case of the few states that already designate \naerosol cans as unive rsal wastes), the states \u201cwould not have to adopt the universal waste \nregulations for aerosol cans.\u201d  Id. at 11,663.  These statements leave open the possibility that \nsome states may never adopt the universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and/or that there may be \nan extended period of time during which there will be a patchwork of regulation for aerosol \ncans.18 \n                                                 \n18  To minimize this patchwork and fully realize the benefits of a universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, we ask EPA to encourage states to quickly adopt the new rule, as the Agency has done for previous \nuniversal waste rules.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,53 6 (May 11, 1995) (final original universal waste rule)  \n(\u201cEven though States are not required to adopt today\u2019s rule, EPA strongly encourages them to do so\u201d) ; 64 Fed. Reg. \n \n- 22 - \n \n \n \nThe proposed rule does not address how this patchwork will work.  However, this issue is of \nvital importance, especially to retailers and other gener ators that may be generating hazardous \naerosol can wastes in multiple states, to persons developing/operating national or regional \ncollection and recycling/disposal programs for aerosol can wastes , and to generators and \ntransporters moving aerosol cans across state lines to appropriate destination facilities .  Of \nparticular importance are the requirements (if any) that may apply to the transport of such wastes \nfrom, to, or through states that have not yet (or never will) classify aerosol cans as universa l \nwastes.  \n \nAs discussed below, EPA has previously addressed essentially the same issue in the context of \nother universal waste rules.  However, when it has done so, it has ignored relevant law and the \nAgency\u2019s own guidance, and arrived at a conclusion that  inappropriately and unnecessarily \nundermined implementation of the universal waste rule.  The Retail Associations urge the \nAgency to rectify the situation by clarifying, once and for all, that once a waste is designated as a \nuniversal waste under federal law, the waste may be transported nationwide without a hazardous \nwaste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  \n \nIn prior universal waste rulemakings, EPA has stated that federally designated universal wastes \nremain subject to full hazardous waste regula tion as long as they are in states that have not (yet) \nadopted the federal universal waste rule, with the result being that transport from, through, or to \nsuch a state must be performed by a hazardous waste transporter and must be accompanied by a \nhazardou s waste manifest.19  However, these statements overlook ed the fact that federal rules for \ntransportation of hazardous materials (including hazardous wastes) generally preempt state rules \nthat are more stringent.   \n \n                                                 \n36,466, 36,4 72 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps)  (\u201cEPA hopes to encourage  \u2026 states to regulate \nspent lamps  as universal waste an d therefore  promote greater consistency in  regulatory approaches across state  \nborders \u201d); 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,516 (August 5, 2005) (final universal waste rule for mercury -containing \nequipment)  (\u201c[states] do not have to adopt the universal waste regulati ons \u2026 although EPA encourages them to do \nso\u201d).   \n \nMoreover, we ask EPA, as it has done in the past for other universal wastes, to state its intention not to take \nenforcement actions involving hazardous aerosol can wastes  managed in accordance with the universal waste rule, \neven if the relevant state has not yet adopted the rule or received authorization for the rule.  See, e.g. , Memorandum \nfrom Steve Herman, Assistant Administrator, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Ass urance, EPA, and Elliott P. \nLaws, Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA, to EPA Regional \nAdministrators (April 10, 1996) (RCRA Online #11960) (Attachment 15) (\u201cBy finalizing 40 C.F.R. Part 273, EPA \nhas taken the positio n that managing wastes in compliance with those standards is environmentally protective.  \nTherefore, \u2026 Regions should take enforcement actions involving universal wastes only where handlers of such \nwastes are not in full compliance with the Part 273 standa rds\u201d); Memorandum from Mike Shapiro, Director, Office \nof Solid Waste, EPA, to Senior RCRA Policy Managers, EPA Regions I -X (February 13, 1997) (RCRA Online \n#14088) (Attachment 16) (same).  \n \n19  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,537 -38 (May 11, 1995) (final  original universal waste rule); 64 Fed. Reg. \n36,466, 36,482 -83 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps); 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,516 -17 (August 5 , \n2005) (final universal waste rule for mercury -containing equipment).   \n \n \n- 23 - \n \n \nEPA itself has previously noted  the preemp tive effect of federal rules for transport of hazardous \nwastes, stating for example that  \u201c[even though] p reemption authorities are quite foreign to \nRCRA [ they] are introduced into the transporter arena by the statutory directive in RCRA to \nmain tain consist ency with the DOT framework [for transportation of hazardous materials  under \nthe Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (\u201cHMTA\u201d) ].\u201d20  Indeed, e ven state hazardous waste \ntransport requirements that have been authorized by EPA pursuant to RCRA are not immune  to \npre-emption under the HMTA.21   \n \nIn the present case, if  hazardous aerosol can wastes are classified as universal wastes, any state \nrules requiring such items to be shipped as ordinary hazardous wastes would be preempted.  \nConsider, for example, the req uirement that hazardous wastes be transported with a manifest.  \nUnder EPA\u2019s proposed rule, hazardous aerosol can wastes would not have to be shipped with a \nmanifest for purposes of federal law.  The HMTA explicitly provides that state shipping paper \nrequir ements (including manifest requirements) are preempted if they are not \u201csubstantively the \nsame\u201d as the corresponding federal requirements.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5125(b)(1)(C).  DOT has \nclarified that, under this standard, state requirements must \u201cconform[  ] in every significant \nrespect to the Federal requirement.\u201d  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 107.202(d).  Thus, any state manifest \nrequirements for aerosol cans  would clearly be preempted.  \n \nAs EPA itself stated in 1984, federal law \u201cprohibit[s] States from requiring separate State \nmanifests or other information to accompany  waste shipments  [if such documents or information \nare not required by federal law] .\u201d22  DOT echoed these statements in its own 1984 not ice, saying \nthat \u201cno carrier could be required to carry  any State manifest form that differs from the EPA \n                                                 \n20  See Letter from Mich ael Shapiro, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Richard J. Barlow, Northeast \nWaste Management Officials Association (\u201cNEWMOA\u201d) (June 11, 1996) (RCRA Online #14135)  (Attachment 17); \nsee also N.Y. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation v.

As in the case of state manifest requiremen ts, state rules governing packaging, \nlabeling, or release reporting during transportation are explicitly preempted if they differ in any \nrespect from the federal rules.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  5125(b)(1)(B), (D).  State rules for licensing or \nregistration of tra nsporters are also preempted if they operate as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the goals of the \nfederal hazardous materials law.26  Of course, state rules related to handling of aerosol cans at \nstationary facilities will generally not be preempted, because they do not in volve transportation .27       \n \nThe Retail Associations recognize that EPA may be inclined to defer on the issue of preemption \nto the department that is responsible for implementing the federal hazardous materials \ntransportation law (i.e., DOT).  However, EPA\u2019s prior statements on interstate transport  of \nuniversal wastes have sufficiently clouded the issue that it is now essential that the Agency set \nthe record straight (in consultation with DOT, if necessary).  EPA, in fact, has been willing to do \nso in the past.28  The Agency should be eager to do so in the current case, because preemption \nwill significantly advance the goal of facilitating nationwide recycling of aerosol cans .  At a \nminimum, EPA should disavow the statements in prior universal waste rules, a nd clarify that \nthey were not intended to represent determinations that state rules requiring hazardous waste \nmanifests or hazardous waste transporters were not preempted.    \n                                                 \n23  See 49 Fed. Reg. 10,507, 10,508 (March  20, 1984); see also id . (\u201cwhile [the uniform manifest rules] do not \nprohibit the transporter from voluntarily carrying [additional] information, they do preclude States from requiring \nthe transporter to do so\u201d).   \n \n24  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 62,527, 62,53 7-38 (December 6, 1995) (New York regulations requiring additional \nmanifest information are preempted, because there are no corresponding federal requirements); 58 Fed. Reg. 11,176 \n(February 23, 1993) (Illinois regulations requiring a different format for providing information on the manifest are \npreempted).   \n \n25  See 62 Fed. Reg. 1208 (January 8, 1997) (expanding the scope of the hazardous materials regulations to \ncover intrastate shipments, consistent with a 1990 amendment to the federal hazardous materials transportation law \ncodified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7  5103(b)(1)).  \n \n26  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7  5125(a)(2); Colorado Public Utilities Commission v. Harmon , 951 F.2d 1571 (10th Cir. \n1991) (Colorado permit requirements for hazardous material transporters are preempted  because they are an obstacle \nto the congressional goal of promoting safety through uniform standards).   \n \n27  One possible exception relates to loading, unloading, and storage activities that are incidental to \ntransportation.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 61,906, 61,9 38 (October 30, 2003) (revising 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.1(c) to clarify that \ntransportation includes loading, unloading, and storage incidental to transportation) and 61,923 -24 (explaining that \nstate and local requirements related to these activities may be preemp ted). \n \n28  See, e.g.,  49 Fed. Reg. at 10,495 (\u201cStates through which hazardous waste shipments pass are not allowed to \nplace additional information requirements on the transporter as a condition of transportation.\u201d); RCRA/CERCLA \nHotline Report (May 1985) (RC RA Online #12399)  (Attachment 19) (\u201cStates through which [a] waste shipment \ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements.\u201d).   \n \n- 25 - \n \n \n \nFinally, the Retail Associations recognize that EPA may also be reluctant to add ress the \npreemption issue due to concerns about the potential reactions of state regulatory agencies.  \nAlthough such agencies may generally be protective of their sovereign authority, we believe that, \nin the present case, they generally recognize the benefits of uniform national regulations for \nhazardous aerosol can wastes.  Indeed, they may welcome preemption as important step forward \nin meeting recycling goals for such wastes .  Moreover, EPA would not be establishing new law \nby addressi ng the preemption issue.  Rather, it would simply be recognizing that, under existing \nlaw, the effect of the new federal universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol can wastes would be \nto preempt more stringent state rules for transportation of such wastes . \n \n7. EPA\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis Dramatically Underestimates the Potential Cost \nSavings That Would Be Achieved Under the Universal Waste Rule   \n \nIn the Regulatory Impact Analysis (\u201cRIA\u201d) for the proposed rule, EPA\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d analysis \nestimates that the costs savings associated with the proposal would be only $3.0 to $3.5 million \nper year.  See RIA at 24.  The Agency also includes an \u201calternative\u201d analysis in an appendix, \nwhich results in an estimate of $56.7 to $63.3 million per year, but discounts this analysis by \nsaying that \u201cthe analysis presented in this appendix \u2026 may overestimate cost savings.\u201d  Id. at 48 -\n49.  As discussed below, EPA\u2019s primar y analysis dramatically underestimates the likely cost \nsavings, in part because it fails to take into account the unique characteristics of affected \nfacilities in the retail sector, which the Agency itself acknowledges represent about two -thirds of \nthe uni verse of affected hazardous waste generators.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Indeed, even \nEPA\u2019s alternative analysis likely understates the cost savings significantly.  \n \nThroughout the RIA, EPA notes that the \u201ccost savings [under the proposal] are largely \nattributable to facilities changing generator status as a result of no longer having to count aerosol \ncans towards their HW [hazardous waste] generator status.\u201d  See RIA at ES -4, 24, and 47.  The \nRetail Associations  agree, but take issue with the Agency\u2019s es timates of the number of facilities \nexpected to change generator status, especially under the primary analysis.  According to that \nanalysis, only about 500 facilities nationwide across all industries would change generator status \nunder the proposal, repres enting less than 0.8% of the aerosol -generating L arge Quantity \nGenerator (\u201cL QG\u201d) universe and 3.7% of the aerosol -generating S mall Quantity Generator \n(\u201cSQG\u201d) universe.  Id. at ES -4 and 19.  However, these figures seem extremely  low.  Some \nindividual retail  companies are likely to have more than 500 facilities  change generator status as \na result of a universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and the number across the entire retail sector \nwould clearly be many times that figure (not even counting the number of f acilities in other \nindustries).  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Retail Associations and the retail sector as a \nwhole ha ve been urging the Agency so strongly over the last several years to classify and \nregulate aerosol cans as universal wastes.  \n \nBased on our review of the RIA, we believe there are three main sources of EPA\u2019s error, each of \nwhich is discussed briefly below:  \n \n \n- 26 - \n \n \no Use of  SQG  Data Skewed Heavily to the Manufacturing Sector .  EPA apparently \nestimated the percentage of SQGs that would become  VSQGs under the proposal by \nreviewing the admittedly very limited data on SQGs in its 2015 Biennial Report (\u201cBR\u201d) \ndatabase, and determining for each SQG facility in that database how the exclusion of \naerosol cans from counting toward the SQG threshold mig ht affect the status of the \nfacility.  See RIA at 18 (explaining the methodology) and 8 (explaining that the BR \ndatabase is a \u201csignificant underrepresentation\u201d of the SQG universe, because \u201conly LQGs \nare required to make BR submissions\u201d).  However, the BR data on SQGs are heavily \nskewed toward the manufacturing sector.  Only 8% of the aerosol -generating SQGs in the \nBR database are from the retail sector, even though EPA itself acknowledges that the \nsector represents fully 65% of the aerosol -generating unive rse.29  In contrast, almost half \nof the aerosol -generating SQGs in the BR database are in the manufacturing sector.   See \nRIA at 7.   \n \n In light of the above, EPA\u2019s estimate of the percentage of SQGs that would become \nVSQGs under the proposal  is based primarily on manufacturing facilities, even though \nretail stores represent by far a greater number of affected facilities and have \ncharacteristics that make it far more likely that they will change generator status.  \nMember s of the Retail Associa tions  have reported that aerosol cans frequently account \nfor 50% (by weight) or even more of all the potentially hazardous unsold/returned \nproducts handled by retailers.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 16.  We \nsuspect that few, if any, manufactur ing facilities would have such a high proportion of \naerosol can wastes.  Moreover, given the fundamental difference s in the operations of \nretail stores and manufacturing facilities, we suspect that retail stores in the SQG \ncategory are much more likely to generate waste quantities only slightly above the SQG \nthreshold and/or to exceed that threshold only on an episodic basis.  Taken together, these \ncharacteristics make it much more likely that SQG retail stores would become VSQGs \nunder a universal waste rul e for aerosols.30   \n \nBy basing its estimate of the effects primarily on facilities in the manufacturing sector \n(and in other sectors that likewise are substantially different from the retail sector that \nrepresents the bulk of affected generators), EPA has d ramatically understated the \npercentage of SQGs that would become VSQGs under the proposal .  The effects of this \nerror on the bottom -line estimate of cost savings are very substantial.  EPA\u2019s alternative \nanalysis estimates that approximately 80% of aerosol -generating SQGs will become \nVSQGs under the proposal.  See RIA at 48.  That figure seems much closer to reality, and \n                                                 \n29  See RIA at 7 (indicating that the BR database has only 59 aerosol -generating SQG retail facilities out of a \ntotal 710 aerosol -generating SQG facilities across all industries, which corresponds to 8%); 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655 \n(\u201c[the] top economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the largest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade \nindustry \u2026 representing 65% of the affect ed \u2026 universe\u201d).   \n \n30  See, e.g. , Retail Associations NODA Comments at 24, n.26 (\u201cSeveral members of the Retail Associations \n\u2026 estimate that well over half  of their stores would be reclassified as CESQGs if all aerosols were exempted from \n\u2018counting\u2019 for purposes of determining generator status [as would be the case under the universal waste rule]\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  \n \n \n- 27 - \n \n \nby EPA\u2019s estimates would increase the annual cost savings from the $3.0 -$3.5 million \nrange to the $56.7 -$63.3 million  range.  \n \no Failure to  Account for Expected Change in the Status of Large Numbers of Retail \nLQG Facilities under the Upcoming Rule on Low-Concentration Nicotine Products.   \nAs noted above, EPA\u2019s primary analysis projects that only a handful of the estimated \n6520 aerosol -generati ng LQG facilities in the country will change generator status as a \nresult of the proposed rule.   See RIA at ES -4 and 19.   In fact, however, it is likely that \nlarge numbers of these facilities will change status under the universal waste rule for \naerosols.  The reason is that the vast majority of these LQGs (4 ,225, according to EPA\u2019s \nprimary estimate) are retail stores, see id . at 7,  and we believe that most of these facilities \nare LQGs only because they generate more than 1 kg of low -concentration nicotine \nproducts ( e.g., nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, prescription liquids, and e -cigarettes), \nwhich are currently classified as acutely hazardous wastes under RCRA.31  EPA has \nproposed to reclassify these products as non -acutely hazardous wastes or to exclude t hem \nfrom RCRA regulation, either one of which would likely cause many of these facilities to \nbe reclassified as SQGs.   See 80 Fed. Reg. at 58,071 -73.  Like other SQG retail facilities, \nthese newly -SQG retail facilities would be highly likely to change to V SQG facilities \nunder the universal waste rule for aerosols.   \n \n If these newly -SQG retail facilities are included in the analysis, the effects on the  bottom -\nline estimate of cost savings would be substantial.   EPA has estimated that the annual \ncost savings  per facility of changing from an SQG to a VSQG would be $3600 to $3800 \n(assuming that virtually all of these facilities will be Small Quantity Handlers of \nUniversal Wastes (\u201cSQHUWs\u201d)).  See RIA at 25.  Thus, if there are 3,000 newly -SQG \nretail facilities that would become VSQGs as a result of the universal waste rule for \naerosols,32 the total annual cost savings for these facilities alone would be $10.8 to $11.4 \nmillion \u2013 a few times EPA\u2019s primary estimate of the annual cost savings for the entire \ncountry .  Assuming EPA finalizes its rule on low -concentration nicotine products before \nit finalizes the proposed universal waste rule for aerosols, it should revise its RIA to \naccount for these substantial additional savings.  \n \no Underestimate of Baseline Numbers o f LQG and SQG Facilities Generating Aerosol \nWastes.   EPA\u2019s primary analysis in the RIA estimates that there are currently 6,520 \nLQGs and 13,019 SQGs that generate aerosol can wastes, while the Agency\u2019s alternative \n                                                 \n31  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.33(e) (EPA Hazardo us Waste No. P075) (acute hazardous waste listing for nicotine); \n80 Fed. Reg. 58,014, 58,017 (September 25, 2015) (\u201cunused nicotine patches, gums and lozenges are finished \ndosage forms of nicotine and therefore are regulated as P075 when discarded\u201d); Retai l Associations NODA \nComments at 9 (stating that \u201cMembers of the Retail Associations report that low -[concentration] nicotine products \nare the sole reason why the vast majority of stores handling such products are classified as LQGs\u201d and estimating \nthe numb ers of such facilities in the several thousands).   \n \n32  This figure corresponds to approximately 70% of the 4,225 aerosol -generating retail industry LQGs \nidentified by EPA in its primary analysis.  We note that even if the actual percentage of retail LQGs that would be \naffected in this way is lower than 70%, the 3,000 facility figure may be reasonable, given that EPA\u2019s baseline figure \nof 4,225 retail LQGs generating hazardous aerosol can wastes is probably far too low (as discussed further below).   \n \n- 28 - \n \n \nanalysis estimates the figures at 7,239 an d 14,454, respectively.  See RIA at 19 and 48.  \nThe Retail Associations  believe that these baseline numbers are likely all too low.  With \nrespect to LQGs, the 2013 BR data showed a total of 20,771 LQGs.  See EPA, \n\u201cRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potent ial Costs, Benefits, and Other Impacts of the \nFinal Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule \u201d (September 2016) (\u201cGenerator \nRule RIA\u201d)  (Attachment 20), Exhibit 2 -6.  It seems likely that virtually all of these LQGs \ngenerate at least some aerosol can wast es, if nothing else from cleaning offices and \nbathrooms.  Yet, the current RIA estimates suggest that only about one -third of these \nLQGs generate any aerosol can wastes.  Focusing just on the retail sector, the 2013 BR \ndata showed 5,563 LQGs in the industr y, virtually all in retail categories, such as health \nand personal care stores, that can almost invariably be expected to sell aerosol products \n(and thus to generate significant quantities of aerosol wastes).  Id.  Yet, the current RIA \nestimates that only 4,225 retail LQGs generate aerosol wastes.   \n \n The apparent underestimates are magnified in the RIA, since EPA bases its estimates of \naerosol -generating SQGs on its estimates of aerosol -generating LQGs.  In particular, \nEPA arrived at its SQG estimates by m ultiplying the LQG estimates by a factor of two \n(2.0).  See RIA at 8 -9.  However, there are several reasons to question this methodology.  \nFirst, as noted above, the underlying estimates of the number of aerosol -generating LQGs \nseem low.  Second, in the RI A for the 2016 hazardous waste generator rule, EPA \nestimated that the ratio of SQGs to LQGs was significantly higher, namely between 2.4 \nand 3.1.  See Generator Rule RIA, Exhibit ES -2.  Although these ratios were not focused \nspecifically on aerosol -generat ing generators, there is no apparent reason why the ratios \nwould be significantly different for such generators, as opposed to generators of \nhazardous wastes as a whole.  Third, EPA based its factor of 2.0 on data from just 3 \nstates, and for one of those s tates, the Agency acknowledged that it had to use indirect \n(and probably incomplete) means to identify the relevant facilities.  See RIA at 8.  Fourth, \nEPA in the 2014 NODA estimated that the number of SQGs in the retail sector alone was \n16,774 (virtually all of which would be expected t o generate significant quantities of \naerosol wastes) , which is substantially greater than the number of SQGs that EPA is now \nestimating for all industries  (i.e., 13,019 under the primary analysis, and 14,454 under the \naltern ative analysis) .  See RIA at ES -4 and 19 (estimate from the primary analysis) and \n48 (estimate from the alternative analysis); 79 Fed. Reg. 8,926, 8,932 (February 14, \n2014) (NODA estimate).     \n \n These deviations raise serious questions about EPA\u2019s methodo logy, and suggest that the \nbaseline estimates of the affected universe of generators \u2013 and therefore the ultimate \nestimate of the costs savings \u2013 are substantially too low.  As noted above, even a \nrelatively modest increase in the number of generators whos e status would change under \nthe universal waste rule could increase the expected cost savings by millions of dollars \neach year.  \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above, the Retail Associations  believe that EPA has dramatically \nunderestimated the likely cos t savings that would result from a universal waste rule for aerosol \n \n- 29 - \n \n \ncans.  Adding up all the estimates discussed above, we believe that the total cost savings will \nlikely be at least $80 million per year, and potentially significantly higher.        \n \n8. EPA Should Follow Through on Its Commitment to Issue Guidance on the Extent to \nWhich Aerosol Cans Are Subject to RCRA Regulation in the First Instance  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  believe that EPA\u2019s proposal to classify and regulate hazardous \naerosol can wastes as universal wastes is a major step forward in improving the regulatory \nframework for such materials, we also believe it is imperative for the Agency issue guidance on \nwhen aerosol cans qualify as solid and hazardous wastes, and are subject to R CRA regulation, in \nthe first instance.  Since a t least as far back as 2014, the Retail Associations have stressed that an \neffective strategy for aerosol cans requires not only a universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, but also new guidance o n these fundamental issues.  See, e.g. , Retail Associations \nNODA Comments at 20 -25.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , underscored the importance \nof guidance (as well as a universal waste rule) in its 2017 comments on EPA\u2019s regulatory reform \nefforts under Executive Order 13777.  See RILA Regulatory Reform Comments at 8-12.  In its \n2016 Retail Strategy, EPA acknowledged the need for additional guidance, committing, for \nexample, to develop a \u201cguide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subti tle C \nrecycling exclusions .\u201d  See EPA , \u201cStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA\u2019s \nRegulatory Framework \u201d (September 12, 2016) (Attachment 27)  at 6.  We urge EPA to follow \nthrough on this commitment, and would welcome the opportunity to assist the Agency in this \neffort.   EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste \nrule, if that can be done without dela ying the universal waste rule.  However, the first priority \nshould be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be \nfollowed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.   \n \nWe believe that guidance is needed on four main issues , each of which is discussed briefly \nbelow:  \n \no Applicability of the Definition of Solid Waste to Aerosol Cans Destined for \nReclamation .  EPA should clarify that aerosol cans (whether full, partially full, or empty) \nare not solid wastes when th ey are destined for reclamation ( e.g., recovery of metals in \nthe housing of the dispenser, useful propellants such as hydrocarbons suitable for use as \nfuel, and/or the chemical products originally intended t o be dispensed).  The Agency has \nlong stated that  aerosol cans, as well as the propellants and chemical products inside, are \n\u201ccommercial chemical products.\u201d33  As commercial chemical products, the aerosol cans \n                                                 \n33  See, e.g., Memorandum from Sylvia K. Lowrance, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Karl E.  \nBremer, Chief, RCRA Permitting Branch, EPA Region 5 (December 30, 1992) (RCRA Online #11717)  (\u201cLowrance \nMemorandum\u201d) (Attachment 21) (\u201cthe remaining propellants in  the cans [are] unused \u2026 [and] would be classified \nas commercial chemical products\u201d ); id. (\u201cif the aerosol cans are \u2026 partially full \u2026 they would be considered off -\nspecification [commercial chemical products]\u201d); Letter from Sylvia K. Lowrance, Director, Office of Solid Waste, \nEPA, to Kurt E. Whitman, Project Coordinator, SWInc. (September 30, 1988) (RCRA Online #13225)  (Attachment \n22) (\u201c[aerosol] cans are hazardous [under the commercial chemical product listings] if \u2026 they contain a commercial \nchemical pr oduct on the 40 CFR 261.33(e) or (f) lists\u201d) ; Denit Letter #2 (Attachment 14) (\u201cliquids or contained \ngases removed from aerosol cans may be \u2026 listed in Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 261,\u201d where the only potentially \nrelevant listings would be the commercial chem ical product listings); Denit Letter #1 (Attachment 13) (same).   \n \n- 30 - \n \n \nare classified as non -wastes under the RCRA regulations if they are destined for \nreclamation .34  Importantly, EPA has explicitly stated that a material may be legitimately \nreclaimed even if only non -hazardous components are being recovered.35  Thus, even if \nthe aerosol cans are being reclaimed only to recover non -hazardous components such as \nthe metal housings, the cans are properly classified as commercial chemical products \ndestined for reclamation, and thus not solid or hazardous wastes.36 \n   \no Potential Reactivity of Aerosol Cans .  EPA has long suggested that waste aerosol cans, \nwhether full or empty,  have the potential to qualify as reactive hazardous wastes on the \nbasis that they are \u201ccapable of detonation or explosive reaction if [they are] subjected to a \nstrong initiating source or if heated under confinement.\u201d37  However, as the Retail \nAssociations  have demonstrated, aerosol cans do not, in fact, exhibit the reactivity \ncharacteristic.  See generally  Retail Associations NODA Comments at 20 -23.   \n \n                                                 \n \n34  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(3) (listed commercial chemical products  are not solid wastes when destined for \nreclamation ); 50 Fed. Reg. 14,216, 14,219 (April 11, 1985) (specifying that the ru les for listed commercial chemical \nproducts also apply to characteristic commercial chemical products) ; see also  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1(c)(4)  (defining \nreclamation to include \u201cprocess[ing] to recover a usable product\u201d ). \n \n35  See, e.g. , 73 Fed. Reg. 64,668, 64,74 5 (October 30, 2008) (stating that \u201c[i]t has been the Agency\u2019s \nlongstanding policy that \u2026 not every constituent or component in a hazardous secondary material would have to \ncontribute \u2026 to the recycling process,\u201d and indeed \u201cthe non -hazardous component of hazardous secondary materials \n[can] provide the useful contribution\u201d; also citing as examples the use/recovery of non -hazardous glass from lead -\ncontaining cathode ray tubes, and the use/recovery of non -hazardous zinc from certain hazardous secondary \nmateri als); 78 Fed. Reg. 46,448, 46,462 (July 31, 2013) (stating that \u201cEPA\u2019s long -standing policy regarding \nlegitimate recycling does not require that 100% of the hazardous secondary material be reclaimed in order to be \nlegitimately recycled,\u201d and concluding tha t solvent -contaminated wipes destined to be laundered to \nrecover/regenerate the fabric cloth are being legitimately reclaimed, even though the hazardous solvents are being \ndiscarded).   \n \n36  At a minimum, EPA should clarify that aerosol cans containing non -hazardous chemical products and \nignitable propellants that are commonly used as fuels ( e.g., propane and butane) are not hazardous wastes if they are \ndestined for reclamation to recover the propellants for use as fuels or for use in making fuels.  As the Retail \nAssociations explained in detail in comments on the 2014 NODA, none of the components of these products are \nsubject to RCRA regulation.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 23 -25.  The chemical product intended to \nbe dispensed in this situation  is non -hazardous, and thus clearly not a RCRA hazardous waste.  The metal housing \nlikewise is non -hazardous (and would be excluded or exempt from regulation if it were also reclaimed).  Moreover, \nEPA has clearly stated that the only remaining component \u2013 the propellant \u2013 would not be a solid waste.  See \nLowrance Memorandum  (Attachment 21) (\u201cSince [butane and propane propellants] are fuels and being burned for \nenergy recovery, they would not fall within the definition of a solid waste and would consequentl y not be considered \nhazardous wastes\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(2)(ii) (commercial chemicals products destined to be used as fuels or to \nmake fuels \u201care not solid wastes if they are themselves fuels\u201d).  Inasmuch as none of the components would be solid \nor haz ardous wastes, the aerosol cans would also not be subject to RCRA regulation.  \n \n37  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027)  (Attachment 12) (\u201cIrrespective \nof the lack of contained waste, \u2026 aerosol cans [c]ould be a RCRA hazardous w aste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.23(a)(6) (supposedly relevant part of the definition of \nreactivity).   \n \n \n- 31 - \n \n \n In general, DOT requirements for the design, manufacture, and testing of aerosol cans \nensure that the pr oducts will not burst \u2013 much less explode or detonate \u2013 when heated to \nthe types of temperatures contemplated by the RCRA reactivity characteristic ( e.g., 140\u00b0F \nor 160\u00b0F), or when subjected to the types of initiating sources contemplated by the \ncharacteris tic (e.g., jostling, bumping, tipping, and dropping).38  Moreover, EPA has long \nstated that the reactivity characteristic is intended to capture only a \u201cfairly narrow \ncategory of wastes\u201d that are \u201cclearly\u201d hazardous, even \u201cto the generator\u2019s own \noperations. \u201d39  Aerosol cans do not exhibit any of these indicia of reactivity, given that \nthey are ubiquitously generated and EPA itself has expressed uncertainty about when \naerosol s might be reactive.40  Thus, we urge EPA to issue guidance cla rifying that aerosol \ncans do not exhibit the RCRA characteristic of reactivity.             \n \no Point at Which Aerosol Cans Are \u201cEmpty.\u201d    As EPA noted in the preamble to the \nproposed rule, \u201c[a]n aerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR \n261.7 is not subject to hazardous waste regulation.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660.   \nHowever, it is unclear under the referenced definition when aerosol cans qualify as \nempty.  For this  reason, we urge EPA to provide  guidance on this issue.  In general, we \nbelieve such guidance must provide a practical means for generators to determine when \naerosol cans are empty, recognizing that aerosols are used and/or generated as wastes in \nan extrao rdinarily wide range of circumstances by persons of widely ranging degrees of \nknowledge and experience with hazardous wastes , and that aerosol cans are closed and \nopaque units that prevent direct observation of the contents and limit direct access to the \ncontents.  \n \n                                                 \n38  See, e.g. , 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(ii) (requiring metal aerosol cans to be \u201ccapable of withstanding without \nbursting a pressure of one and one -half times  the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 130\u00b0F\u201d (emphasis added)); \n\u00a7 173.24(b)(1) (requiring all packagings, including aerosol cans, to be \u201cdesigned, constructed, maintained, filled, \n[their] contents so limited, and closed, so that under conditions normally incident to transportation \u2026 there will be \nno identifiable \u2026 release of hazardous materials to the environment\u201d); Memorandum from John J. Skinner, \nDirector, Office of Solid Waste, EPA,  to David Wagoner, Director, Air & Waste Management Division, EPA \nRegion VIII (November 30, 1984) (RCRA Online #12339) (Attachment 23) (concluding that small caliber \nammunition up to 0.50 caliber are not reactive, based on tests showing that they do not de tonate or explode at 160\u00b0F \nor when subjected to \u201cdrop tests \u2026 to simulate handling errors\u201d).  \n \n39  See EPA, \u201cBackground Document : Reactivity  Characteristic\u201d  (May 1980)  (Attachment 24) at 10 (\u201cthe \nproblems posed by reactive wastes appear to be confined to a f airly narrow category of wastes\u201d); 51 Fed. Reg. \n21,648, 21,649 (June 13, 1986) (\u201ccharacteristics define broad classes of wastes that are clearly hazardous\u201d \n(emphasis added)); 45 Fed. Reg. 33,084 , 33,110 (May 19, 1980) (\u201c[m]ost generators of reactive wastes  are aware \nthat their wastes possess this property \u2026 because such wastes are dangerous to the generators\u2019 own operations\u201d).   \n \n40  See, e.g. , Letter from Elizabeth A. Cotsworth, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to T.L. \nNebrich, Jr., Technical Di rector, Waste Technology Service, Inc. (May 19, 1997) (RCRA Online #14235) \n(Attachment 25) (\u201cOver the past several  years  we have received numerous  questions concerning the regulatory \nstatus of used aerosol cans under the \u2026 hazardous waste regulations.  We are not at this time able to make a \ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range of products \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  \n   \n \n- 32 - \n \n \nUnder the regulations, aerosol s can and should be deemed empty once they are no longer \ncapable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for \nthe intended application  (e.g., once the can starts sputtering or other wise delivering an \nuneven spray) .  At that point, \u201c[a]ll waste s have been removed that can be removed using \nthe practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container [ i.e., \nan aerosol can] ,\u201d see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(i), since it wo uld not be common to keep \nusing an aerosol can once it is no longer dispensing the product properly.  In addition, at \nthat point, the aerosol can would almost certainly contain no more than 1 inch of \nchemical product  inside , as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(ii), since the chamber \nwith the chemical product is rarely (if ever) more than 8 inches tall and manufacturers \nseem unlikely to design a product that leaves more than 1/8th of the chemical product \nstranded inside after use.  Further, at this point , some significant portion of the propellant \nis likely to have been discharged, and in this sense the pressure would have \n\u201capproache[d] atmospheric,\u201d as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)( 2).  Thus, there is a \nsolid basis for issuing practical guidance that  an aerosol can qualifies as empty once it \nstops dispensing the chemical product in a proper way.41 \n \no Use of Statistics to Determine the Quantity of Aerosol Cans to be Counted Toward a \nGenerator\u2019s Status.   Under the proposed rule, VSQGs would not have to manage their \nhazardous aerosol can wastes in accordance with the universal waste rule (although they \ncould do so at their option).  We believe that a generator should be able to use statistical \ninformation ( e.g., from similar facilities) to determine the p ercentage of aerosol cans that \nneed to be counted toward the VSQG limit, without making a determination for each \nindividual can as to whether it is a hazardous waste, empty, etc.  EPA has previously \nallowed this type of approach for another situation in wh ich individual wastes of a \nparticular type may be either hazardous or nonhazardous,42 and we urge the Agency to \nconfirm that a similar approach may be used for aerosol cans.    \n \n9. Conclusion      \n \nFor the reasons discussed above,  the Retail Associations  strongly support the classification and \nregulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under RCRA.  Indeed, we believe \naerosol cans are particularly well suited for addition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all \n                                                 \n41  We also urge EPA to issue similar guidance on the issue of when aerosol cans no longer contain \n\u201csignificant liquids,\u201d which (as discussed in Section 5.3 above) is the standard that EPA has established for when \naerosol cans (whether \u201cempty\u201d or not) may be recycled as scrap metal.  \n \n42  See Letter from Michael Shapir o, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Lynn L. Bergeson (July 13, \n1995) (RCRA Online #14003) (Attachment 26) (\u201cwe believe that it would be appropri ate for a generator to rely on \n\u2018knowledge \u2019 of the waste \u2026 based on studies done to characterize the freq uency of \u2018hazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze \ngenerated (relative to the generation of \u2018nonhazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze), in order to characterize the total volume of \nhazardous waste generated.  [For example, if] data \u2026 indicate that up to 40% of the spent antifree ze flushed from \nradiators may be hazardous \u2026 it would be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total \nconsolidated volume of spent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60% nonhazardous. \u2026  [T]his \napproach would be appro priate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the purposes of being \neligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators\u201d).    \n \n- 33 - \n \n \nof the criteri a specified in the regulations for classification as universal wastes.  However, we urge \nEPA to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated and gas -only products, by \nremoving or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leakin g or damage, and by \nclarifying the status of empty aerosol cans.  Such changes are needed to make the rule workable \n(especially for retailers, which EPA estimates represent approximate two -thirds of the affected \ngenerator universe) and to maximize the bene fits of the rule .  The Agency should also clarify that as \nsoon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all \nstates without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.   \n \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings that would result from the rule are likely far \ngreater than EPA estimated in its RIA \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 million per year or more.  Although \nthis would be a major step forward in improving the r egulatory framework for aerosol cans , we \nalso believe it is imp ortant for the Agency issue guidance clarifying (a) that aerosol cans destined \nfor recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that aerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of \nreactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty once they are no longer capable of dispensing \nthe chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for the intended application , and \n(d) that generators may use statistical information to determine the quantity of a erosol cans that \nneed to be counted in determining their hazardous waste generator status.  EPA should try to \nissue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste rule, if that can be done \nwithout delaying the universal waste rule.  Howeve r, the first priority should be to issue a final \nuniversal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be followed up afterwards, if \nnecessary, with the guidance.    \n \nOnce again, we appreciate this opportunity to provide our comments on this pro posed \nrulemaking. We would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input and/or to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made above.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nAusten Jensen  \nVice President, Government Affairs  \nRetail Industry Leade rs Association  \n \n \n\n \n- 34 - \n \n \n \nStephanie K.

Each\nof these has its own management requirements:\n\u2022 Non-hazardous batteries: Batteriesthat are not hazardous at the time of disposal are not universal\nwaste. Non-hazardous batteriesinclude alkaline, carbon zinc, chloride zinc (commonly labeled heavy\nduty), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), zinc air, lithium batteriesthat are nine volts or less, and higher\nvoltage lithium batteriesthat have been discharged to less than one volt. Although non-hazardous, you\nare still encouraged to recycle them if collection is available.\n\u2022 Electronic waste: Wastes containing circuit boards or cathode raytubes (CRTs) maybe managed in\nMinnesota under the reduced requirements discussed in MPCA fact sheet #w-hw4-15, Managing\nElectronic Wastes, available at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-15.pdf.\n\u2022 Architecturalpaint:Latexandoil-based architecturalpaintand related coatingsgeneratedbyVerySmall\nQuantity Generators (VSQGs) may be transported to paint collection sites as discussed in MPCA fact\nsheet #w-hw4-37a, Architectural Paint, available at\nhttps://www. pca. state. m n. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-37a . pdf.\n\u2022 PCB-containing ballasts and smallcapacitors:Lightingballastsandsmallcapacitorsthatmaycontain\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) must be managed under the requirements discussed in MPCA fact\nsheet #w-hw4-48f, Managing PCBs in Ballasts and Small Capacitors, available at\nhttps://www. pca. state. mn. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-48f. pdf.\nMinnesota Pollution Control Agency February2018 ~ w-hw4-62\n651-296-6300 ~ 800-6573864 or use your preferred relay service ~ Info.pcaC~state.mn.us Available in alternative formats\n\nManaging universal wastes\nA business or government agencythat generates, transports, or stores universal waste is a universal waste\nhandler.

Universal waste batteriesinclude, but are not limited to lead acid, nickel cadmium,\nlithium greaterthan nine volts (9V), silver-containing, and mercury -containing types.\nYou may drain electrolyte from your universal waste batteries, however the drained electrolyte is a newly\ngenerated waste and not a universal waste. Manage the drained electrolyte as a hazardous waste unless you\nevaluate it asnon-hazardous. For more information on evaluating wastes, see MPCA fact sheet #w-hw1-01,\nEvaluate Waste, at: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw1-01.pdf.\nYou may also discharge universal waste batteriesif you can do so safely using eitherthe method recommended\nby the batterymanufactureror a complete discharge device (CDD). Do not simply short-circuit batteriesto\ndischarge them; it may cause a ire or batteryexplosion. Lithium batteriesdischarged toless thanone volt may\nbe managed asnon-hazardous waste in Minnesota, but mayremain subject to HMRtransport requirements.\nYou may accumulate different types of universal waste batteriestogether as long as you ensure they will not\nshort-circuit or cause a fire during accumulation. When you ship universal waste batteriesoff site, ensure you\ncomply with applicable HMR requirements to prevent short circuits during transport. You may need to enclose\neach batteryin anon-conducting bag or wrap, insulate terminals, or pack batteriesto prevent them from\ntouching each otheror conductive materials.\nLamps\nUniversal waste lamps include any hazardous waste bulb or tube portion of an electrical lighting device.\nuniversal waste lamps include, but are not limited to fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), mercuryvapor,\nlow and high pressure sodium (LPS and HPS), metal halide, and neon (includes lamps containing other noble\ngases such as argon, krypton, or xenon).\n'Greentip' fluorescent lamps\nCertain models of fluorescent lamps aredesigned to pass the hazardous wastetest for mercury, and are\ncommonly labeled as'low mercury' or by having green-colored metal end caps, known as'greentips'. These\nlamps do still contain mercury, and in Minnesota must still be recycled. 'Greentip' fluorescent lamps from\nbusinesses may not be disposed as solid waste.\nLEDs\nAlthough the bulb portions of most light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are not hazardous and thus not universal waste\nlamps, the attached circuit boards are regulated electronic wastes in Minnesota. See MPCA fact sheet\n#w-hw4-15, Managing Electronic Wastes, at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-15.pdf.\nOn-site crushingorcracking\nIn Minnesota, you may not crush the hazardous portion of universal waste lamps on your site unless you can\ndemonstratethat no hazardous constituents (such as mercury) will be released to the environment from the\nentire crushing process, including filterchanges.The MPCAis notawareofanycommerciallyavailablelamp\ncrushing equipment that can currentlymeet this standard.\nThe MPCA discourages cracking the shell of a universal waste lamp to attempt to remove the hazardous portion\nof the lamp. The hazardous portion of many universal waste lamps is contained in an inner sealed arctube or\ncapsule. Heat and chemical reactions in the arc tube may cause the glass to become brittle. This createsa high\nrisk for da mage a nd mercury release if you attempt to extract the tube from the la mp.\nAccumulation\nIf you accumulate more than 1000 universal waste lamps that you did not generate yourself, you must establish\nfinancial assurance with the MPCA.

Universal waste mercury -containing equipment includes but is not limited to thermometers,\nthermostats, barometers, pressure gauges, switches, relays, and pump seals. Lamps that containgaseous or\npowdered mercury are universal waste lamps, not mercury -containing equipment. Batteriesthatcontain\npowdered or amalgamated mercuryare universal waste batteries, not mercury -containing equipment.\nYou may remove sealed mercury ampoules and open housings holding mercury from universal waste mercury -\ncontaining equipment only if you do all of thefollowing:\n\u2022 Perform the removal over a tray, pan, or other containment device large enough to catch and contain\nany mercury that could spill from the equipment.\n\u2022 Provide appropriate mercury spill clean-up materials and equipment.\n\u2022 Ensure the mercury is contained in the original sealed ampoules or you seal any original open housings\nairtight immediately after removal.\n\u2022 Perform air monitoring to ensure you do not exceed Minnesota Occupational Safetyand Health\n(MNOSHA) exposure levels. For questions, contact MNOSHA. See More information on page 6.\n\u2022 Do not pour, extract, or remove liquid mercuryfrom any mercury -containing equipment.\nManage spilled mercury, clean-up materials and debris, and any free liquid mercury or mercury in containers\nsuch as flasks or vials, as newly generated D009 hazardouswaste. These wastes are not universal waste.\nNote: Sales and donations of mercury and mercury -containing equipment in Minnesota are strictly regulated. If\nyou plan to donate or sell liquid mercury or mercury -containing equipment instead of disposing of it, see MPCA\nfact sheet #w-hw4-26, Selling Mercury Items, at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-26.pdf.\nPesticides\nWastes included\nPesticides in Minnesota include fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides, and rodenticides.\nUniversal waste pesticidesare hazardous waste pesticides that:\n\u2022 Will be collectedata Minnesota DepartmentofAgriculture(MDA)-authorizedwastepesticide program.\nSee Using an MDA-authorized program on page 5\n\u2022 Will be collected at a waste pesticide program authorized in an adjoining state\n\u2022 Have been recalled and will be collected by the manufacturer.\nUniversal waste pesticides do not include pesticides used for their intended purpose in accordance with their\nlabel instructions and MDAstandards. universal waste pesticides also do not include medical sterilant products.\nLabeling\nIn addition to the standard universal waste labeling on page 2, ensure your universal waste pesticide containers\nalso either:\n\u2022 Retaintheir original manufacturerlabel\n\u2022 Display complete DOT labeling and marking applicable under the HMR\n\u2022 Bearan alternate label specified by the authorized waste pesticide collection programthat has agreed\nto acceptthe universal waste pesticide\nPage 4 of 6 I February 2018 ~ w-hw4-62\n\nUsing an MDA-authorized program\nTo use an MDA-authorized program, you must be a pesticide end user as defined bythe MDA. End users include\nfarmers and others who use or intend to use pesticides themselves, and do not include dealers, manufacturers,\nformulator, or packagers.\nContact the MDA if you are unsure if you are an end user or eligible to use an MDA-authorized program.\nSee More information on page 6.\n\u2022 If you accumulate less than 300 pounds (about 35 gallons) of waste pesticide on your site at any one\ntime, you may assume those waste pesticides are universal waste unless the MDA rejectsthem.\n\u2022 If you accumulate 300 pounds or more of waste pesticide on your site at any one time, must manage\nthem under the full hazardous waste requirements, until you have:\n1. Notified the MDAof the type and volume of your waste pesticides.\n2. The MDA has agreed to accept your waste pesticides. After the MDA has agreed to accept\nyour waste pesticides, you may managethem as universal waste.\nDental amalgam being recycled\nDental amalgam being recycled is mercury -containing amalga m generated by dents I care providers from which\nmercury will be reclaimed.

Waste aerosols and\ncompressed gascylinders are containers with hazardouswaste liquids, propellants, or gases that will no longer\nbe used for their intended purpose and have not been shown to be emptyfor hazardouswaste purposes.\nUniversal waste aerosols must be accumulated to prevent accidental activation of the dispensing valves. Leaking\nuniversal waste aerosols must be accumulated in compatible, liquid-tight, labeled containers.\nYou may puncture universal waste aerosols and compressed gas cylinders at your site if you meet certain\nconditions, including collecting and managing all liquids, safeguarding employee safety and health, and\ncomplying with the Minnesota State Fire Code. However, some aerosols and compressed gas cylinders may\npresent unusual safety risks when punctured and be inadvisable for on-site management.\nSee MPCA fact sheet #w-hw4-00, Waste Aerosols and Compressed Gas Cylinders, at\nhttps://www. pca. state. mn. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-00. pdf.\nPage 5 of 6 I February 2018 ~ w-hw4-62\n\nMore Information\nGuidance and requirements in this fact sheet were compiled from the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 40,\nSection 273; Minnesota Statutes, Chapters \u00a718B and \u00a7115A; Minnesota Rules, Chapters 1509, 7001, and 7045;\nand incorporate regulatory interpretation decisions made by the MPCA on September 9, 2008; October 27,\n2008; December 31, 2008; and April 27, 2011; and June 10, 2015.

Waste Identification\nA company generates aerosol paint and solvent cans from\npainting and cleaning operations. The cans are empty as\nper common industry practices used to empty such devices\nto less than 3% by weight of the total capacity of the\ncontainer (40 CFR 261.7(b)(1(1) & (111)). The cans may\nstill contain propellant, making the cans reactive if\nput in contact with a strong initiating force (i.e.,\nintense pressure or heat). Since for all practicable\npurposes the cans are free of contents that might have\nbeen hazardous wastes, would this be regulation of the\naerosol cans themselves? RIL #43 specifically excluded\nthe regulation of the cans, and solely addressed only\nthe potentially hazardous contents. Therefore, would\naerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still\npotentially reactive because of contained propellant be\nregulated as hazardous waste?\nIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the\naerosol cans would be a RCRA hazardous waste\nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous\ncharacteristic of reactivity (40 CFR 261.23(a)(6)).\nSource: Mike Petruska (202) 475-6676\nResearch: Andy O'Hare\nRO 13027\n\nATTACHMENT 13\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOCTOBER 7, 1993\nMr. John DiFazio\nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association\n1913 Eye Street, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20006\nDear Mr. DiFazio:\nOver the past several years we have received numerous questions from you and others\nconcerning the regulatory status of used aerosol cans under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. I understand that confusion about these issues may be\nhindering your cooperative efforts with the Steel Recycling Institute (SRI) to increase steel aerosol can\nrecycling in this country. As environmentally protective recycling is an important part of the Agency's\nwaste management goals, I hope that this letter will help to answer some of these questions.\nRESIDENTIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFirst, I would like to emphasize that under the federal RCRA regulations, household waste\n(including aerosol cans) is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.4 (b) (1)).\nThus, any aerosol cans generated by households are not regulated as hazardous waste. Because this\nexclusion attaches at the point of generation (i.e., the household) and continues to apply throughout the\nwaste management cycle, household aerosol cans collected in municipal recycling programs and\nsubsequently managed in recycling programs continue to be excluded from the hazardous waste\nmanagement regulations.\nThe data submitted by SRI` appear to confirm that the majority of used residential aerosol cans\ncontain very little residual product or propellant. Along with your experience working with many of the\n600 or more communities currently recycling these cans, the data. suggest that aerosol cans can be\neffectively recycled.\nThe Agency does recommend that communities running residential steel recycling programs\neducate their participants to recycle only empty steel aerosol cans. Participants could also be educated\nto: 1) purchase only the amount of consumer products that they need to minimize the quantities of\nunused products, 2) give unused products to someone else who can use them, 3) take unused or\npartially full containers to a household hazardous waste collection program if available, or 4) dispose of\nthe partially full containers as directed on the label.\nCOMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFaxBack # 11780\n\nI understand that you and SRI are also interested in facilitating the recycling of aerosol cans\ngenerated by commercial or industrial generators. The remainder of this letter discusses only these non-\nhousehold waste items.\nWe have been asked whether aerosol cans e~chibit the characteristic of reactivity. At this time,\nthe Agency is not able to determine whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range\nof products are reactive. However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount of\nliquid would clearly meet the definition of scrap metal (40 CFR 261.1 (c)(6)), and thus would be\nexempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iv) if it were to be recycled. Therefore, a\ndetermination of reactivity or any other characteristic would not be relevant. Aerosol cans that have\nbeen punctured so that most of any liquid remaining in the can may flow from the can (e.g., at either end\nof the can), and drained (e.g., with punctured end down), would not contain significant liquids.\nIt should be noted that since the process of emptying the aerosol cans is part of a recycling\nprocess (i.e., scrap steel recycling), this activity would be exempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (except as specified in 40 CFR 261.6(d)). The Agency recommends that these activities be\nconducted in a safe and environmentally protective manner and that care be taken to properly manage\nany contents removed from the container (both liquids and gases). Any liquids or corrtained gases\nremoved from aerosol cans may be subject to regulation as hazardous wastes if they are listed in\nSubpart D of 40 CFR Part 261 or if they e~ibit any characteristics of hazardous waste as described in\nSubpart C of 40 CFR Part 261.\nWe have also been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of\n\"empty\" under 40 CFR 261.7. Again, if the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to\ndetermine whether they are \"empty\" under the criteria listed in 40 CFR 261.7 As long as an aerosol can\nbeing recycled does not contain significant liquids, the can is exempt as scrap metal. However, in order\nto dispose of a can as nonhazardous waste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to\ndetermine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7 (or that the product it contained was not\nhazardous), and that the can itself is not hazardous. If a can is to be disposed of, and either contains or\nis hazardous waste, it must be managed under all applicable regulations.\nPlease be aware that this letter addresses only the federal hazardous waste regulations.\nAuthorized State agencies implement the RCRA program in their states (although some parts of the\nprogram may be implemented by the U.S. EPA Regions), and that state regulations may be more\nstringent than the federal regulations. Anyone managing aerosol cans should contact the appropriate\nstate environmental agency or U.S. EPA Regional Office to determine how the regulations of that\nparticular state will apply to their activities.\nI hope this information is useful in your efforts to increase steel recycling. Thank you for the\nassistance that you and the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association have provided my staff in\nresearching these issues.

However, in\norder to dispose of a can as non-hazardous waste (rather than\nrecycle it), a generator would have to determine that the can is\nempty under 40 CFR 261.7 (or that the product it contained was not\nhazardous), and that the can itself is not hazardous. If a can is\nto be disposed of, and either contains or is hazardous waste, it\nmust be managed under all applicable regulations.\nPlease be aware that this letter addresses only the federal\nhazardous waste regulations. Authorized State agencies implement\nthe RCRA program in their states (although some parts of the\nprogram maybe implemented by the U.S. EPA Regions), and that state\nregulations maybe more stringent than the federal regulations.\nAnyone managing aerosol cans should contact the appropriate state\nenvironmental agency or U.S. EPA Regional Office to determine how\nthe regulations of that particular state will apply to their\nactivities.\nI hope this information is useful in your efforts to increase\nsteel recycling. Thank you for the assistance that you and the\nSteel Recycling Institute have provided my staff in researching\nthese issues.

Laws, Assistant Administrator\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nTO: Regional Administrators\nOn May 11, EPA promulgated a final rule which promotes the environmentally sound collection\nof several hazardous waste categories for recycling or proper disposal under the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This rule, known as the Universal Waste Rule (40 CFR Part\n273), creates a framework for streamlined regulatory requirements for hazardous waste batteries,\ncertain pesticides and mercury -containing thermostats (universal wastes). The Universal Waste rule is\ndesigned to achieve the following three goals: 1) encouraging resource conservation while ensuring\nadequate protection of human health and the environment, 2) improving implementation of the current\nSubtitle C hazardous waste regulatory program, and 3) removing these universal wastes from the\nmunicipal waste stream by providing incentives for individuals and organizations to collect currently\nunregulated wastes and then ensuring that treatment of those wastes meets the hazardous waste\nmanagement standards. To achieve these goals, environmentally sound collection systems must be\ndeveloped for universal wastes. As such, another goal is to foster the development of an appropriate\ncollection infrastructure in all of the States as quickly as possible.\nThe Agency encourages the timely development of the types collection systems allowed by this\nnew regulation. EPA recognizes that both States and private industry may delay the implementation of\nuniversal waste collection programs until States adopt and become authorized for this rule. To facilitate\nthe speedy implementation of the Universal Waste rule, EPA is encouraging States to quickly adopt the\nrule. Because most States are already authorized for the base RCR.A program, authorization for the\nUniversal Waste rule should be swift and uncomplicated. Therefore, Regions should make authorization\nof States for this rule a high priority in Regional State Authorization Programs and should process\nStates' authorization applications as quickly as possible.\nBy finalizing 40 C.F.R. Part 273, EPA has taken the position that managing wastes in\nFaxBack # 11960\n\ncompliance with those standards is environmentally protective. Therefore, where States are\nimplementing the Part 273 standards but have not yet received authorizarion, Regions should\ntalce enforcement actions involving universal wastes only where handlers of such wastes are not in full\ncompliance with the Part 273 standards. Regions should continue to address universal waste\nmanagement practices that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and\nthe environment under the authority provided in section 7003 of RCRA.\nIf you or your staff have any technical questions or concerns regarding the Universal Waste Rule\nor the policies contained in this memorandum, please contact Krishna Meson at (202) 260-5736 or\nBryan Groce at (202) 260-9550 of the Office of Solid Waste.\n\nATTACHMENT 16\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nFEB 13 1997\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT : Universal Waste Questions and Answers Document\nFROM: Mike Shapiro\nOffice of Solid Waste\nTO: Senior RCRA Policy Managers\nRegions I-X\nSince the promulgation of the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule (60 FR 25492),\nseveral States have begun to adopt the Federal program. As a result, many questions have been\nraised with respect to State implementation and enforcement for hazardous wastes covered\nunder the Universal Waste Federal program. Further, States have asked the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) Regional Offices for guidance on adding other types of hazardous\nwaste to their State universal waste programs. To assist those States during their\nimplementation process and to provide you with the Agency's position on these issues, the\nOffice of Solid Waste has prepared a Questions and Answers (Q&A) document. The Q&A\ndocument also addresses other issues related to universal waste management (e.g., universal\nwaste generation and transportation issues). I have attached the document for your information\nand encourage you to share it with the appropriate State Officials.\nIf you have any questions regarding State authorization, please contact Wayne Roepe\nat (703) 308-8630. If you have other questions regarding universal waste management, please\ncontact Bryan Groce of my staff at (703) 308-8750.\nAttachment\ncc: RCRA Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nState Authorization Section Chiefs, Regions I-X\nRCRA Community Relations Coordinators, Regions I-X\nRCRA Enforcement Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nFaxback# 14088\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - -UNIVERSAL WASTES (UW)\n1. Can a state include additional wastes in its UW program at the same time that it establishes\nthe program and then submit both the program and the additional UW to EPA for\nauthorization review at the same time? For example, can a state adopt a UW rule that\nregulates fluorescent bulbs and antifreeze as UW?\nYes, a state can designate additional waste streams as UW at the same time that it creates its\nown UW rule. However, it must find that the wastes meet its criteria for inclusion in the UW\nprogram, and its criteria must be analogous to the federal criteria set out in 273.81. See\npreamble to final UW rule at 60 FR 25512, 25537. The state need not submit the new wastes\nto EPA for authorization. EPA will review and authorize the state's UW program (including\nthe criteria for adding wastes to the program) and the 3 waste streams included in the federal\nprogram. EPA will not conduct any authorization review on any additional, state-only UW.\nEPA, however, requests that states send copies of tentative decisions to include new\nwastes (and proposed management standards for such wastes) to the appropriate FPA\nRegional Office to give EPA an opportunity to comment. See the response to question 5 for\nmore detail on this process.\n2. Can a state itself petition the Agency to add wastes to the federal UW rules - or does the\npetition have to come from a private party?\nA state itself can petition.\n3. a. How will the petition process work at the state level? Will it require public participation\nand rulemaking to add a UW to an authorized state program?\nEPA is requiring states to adopt petition procedures equivalent to the federal petition\nprocedures. This requires states to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on\nany tentative decision to grant or deny a petition to include new universal wastes. See the\npreamble at 60 FR 25537. EPA also assumes that the state will need to follow its normal\nrulemaking procedures to create any new management standards needed for the new UW.\nb. How will EPA adopt a UW -using the Federal Register and public comment process?\nYes. As required by 40 CFR 260.20 (c), if EPA receives a UW petition, it will publish a\nnotice of tentative decision and announce a comment period in the Federal Re  ~ister. After\nconsidering all comments, EPA will publish notice of its final decision in the Federal Re eci.\nThe same process applies to both decisions to grant and to decisions to deny petitions.\n4. a. Can a state add wastes that are state-only hazardous wastes?\nYes. State hazardous waste programs can be more stringent and broader in scope than federal\nprograms. Consequently, states may regulate as \"state-only\" hazardous wastes materials that\n\nare only solid wastes under the federal program. States may streamline their regulation of\nthese \"state-only\" hazardous wastes by including them in their UW programs.\nb. Can a state add wastes that are non-hazardous?\nYes. A state could add non-hazardous solid wastes to its UW program by designating such\nwastes as state-only hazardous wastes and then designating them as UW wastes. Such wastes\nwould be subject to the state's ordinary hazardous waste requirements for treatment and\ndisposal. EPA assumes that states would want this result, because they probably would\ndesignate nonhazardous wastes as universal wastes to divert them from the nonhazardous\nwaste disposal facilities that curently handle them. If, however, a state determined that some\naspects of its hazardous waste management regime should not apply to these state-only\nhazardous wastes, it could create exemptions. (Exemptions would be permissible since the\nwastes would not be regulated as hazardous wastes under the federal program.)\nOne exception applies. A state may not designate as a UW any waste that is hazardous\nunder the federal program due to a rule promulgated under HSWA authority for which the\nstate is not authorized. (For example, a state that was not authorized for the Toxicity\nCharacteristic could not designate a waste that exhibited the TC as a universal waste. See the\npreamble to the final rule at 25537.)\n5. After a state has adopted and is authorized for the UWR -does the state have ultimate\ndecision-making authority to add wastes or does EPA still have involvement? And what is\nEPA's role during the petition process, post authorization?\nStates authorized for the UW rule will not be required to submit program revisions for any\naddition of wastes to their UW program. EPA requests that states send a copy of their tentative\nfindings and any draft regulations for managing the new, state-only universal wastes to the\nappropriate EPA Regional Office. This will provide EPA with an opportunity to comment on\nthe state's proposed action. EPA encourages states to coordinate EPA's review and comment\nwith the opportunity to comment that the state must provide for the public. If EPA finds that a\nstate has added wastes that do not qualify, or that the management standards are not\nsufficiently protective, and that, as a result, the state's program is less stringent than the federal\nprogram, EPA has authority to withdraw authorization of the state's hazardous waste program\nas provided in Part 271.\nEPA will not conduct any authorization review of the new state-only UW and new\nmanagement standards. EPA takes the position that, when it authorizes a state to add wastes\nto the UW category, it authorizes in advance the state's new, state-only universal wastes and\nthe management standards for such wastes. All changes to state regulations needed to\nimplement a UW program for the new UW automatically become part of the authorized state\nprogram once they take effect under state law.\n6a. When will the EPA rule on fluorescent lights be final (designation as a Federal UW vs.\nmanagement as solid waste)?\nEPA has not yet decided when it will promulgate a final rule regarding regulation of\nfluorescent lamps as discussed in the July 1994 proposal.\n\nb. What happens if a state adds fluorescent lamps to its UWR and then EPA decides to come\nout with a conditional exemption for fluorescent lamps?\nIf the conditional exemption is less stringent than the state UW rule, the state would have the\noptio n of adopting the exemption, but would not be required to do so.\n7.a. Where do LDR recordkeeping requirements fit in --- only at the final destination facility?\nYes.\nb. Is the destination facility responsible (liable) for identifying the treatment\nstandards/technologies and filling out certification forms?\nYes. The destination facility is the first entity that handles a UW that is responsible for\ncompliance with any of the LDR requirements, including recordkeeping. For UW handlers\nthat are not subject to the LDR rules, the prohibitions on dilution under the UW program\nprovide the same protection as the dilution prohibition under the LDR program. (See. e.g., 40\nCFR 273.11.)\n8.a. Are all batteries included in the Federal UWR, or just those considered hazardous?\nEPA's federal UW program does not apply to all batteries. The exceptions are listed in 40\nCFR 273.2(b). Generally, the battery must first be a waste. (Note that unused batteries are\nnot always wastes -- someone must first make a decision to discard them (i.e., treat, recycle, or\ndispose of the unused batteries)). Next, the battery must be classified as a hazardous waste\nunder either a hazardous waste listing or a characteristic test and must not be generated by a\nhousehold. One category of batteries which are both wastes and hazardous wastes is\nnevertheless exempt from the UW regulations in Part 273: spent lead-acid batteries managed\nunder 40 CFR Part 266. Finally, the recently enacted \"Mercur}~Containing and Rechargeable\nBattery Management Act\" changes states' options for regulating some batteries which are\nhazardous waste under RCRA. Specifically, the law prohibits states from imposing\nrequirements that are not identical to those found in the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule\nfor the following types of hazardous waste batteries: used rechargeable batteries, lead-acid\nbatteries not covered by 40 CFR part 266 subpart G, rechargeable alkaline products, certain\nmercury-containing batteries banned from domestic sale, and used consumer products\ncontaining rechargeable batteries that are not easily removable. The law does allow states to\nimplement and enforce collection, storage, and transport requirements identical to those\nincluded in the Universal Waste rule.\nb. Do lead acid batteries fall under the UWR or do they stay under the lead-acid battery\nexemption?\nUnder the federal program, lead acid batteries are managed under Part 266, subpart G rather\nthan the UW program. EPA chose to retain the Part 266 standards for these batteries to avoid\ndisrupting the existing recycling program for such batteries because they provide for\n\nprotection of human health and the environment and because they have been highly successful\n(with recycling rates in excess of 90 percent). States, however, retain the authority to regulate\nlead-acid batteries more stringently. Hence, they may choose to regulate lead acid batteries\nunder their UW programs.\n9. A handler who transports UW is considered a UW transporter. Is this for any quantity of\nUW (i.e., in the used oil regulations a used oil generator can transport up to 55 gallons of their\nown used oil without being considered a used oil transporter)?\nYes, all handlers who transport any quantity of UW must meet the UW transporter\nrequirements. There is no de minimis exemption like the one in the used oil program.\n10. Would a program consisting of astate-sponsored network of handler locations at private\nbusinesses be considered a \"waste pesticide collection program\"?\nYes. Part 273 does not require states to operate the waste pesticide collection programs\ndescribed in 40 CFR 273.3(a)(2) in order for the pesticides managed under such programs to\nbe eligible for the UW program.\n11. As the UWR is implemented, do the traditional liability issues change? For example, who\nis liable for any mismanagement of a UW at a handler location, in transit, and at the\ndestination facility? Are any and all handlers liable for mismanagement at a destination\nfacility or at subsequent handlers? Or, just the \"final handler\" that chooses the destination\nfacility? Do we lose cradle-to-grave responsibility with UWR?\nUnder the full Subtitle C program, only the waste handler that violates a hazardous waste\nregulation is \"liable\" (i.e., subject to enforcement) for that violation. Generators of hazardous\nwaste are not responsible for mismanagement by subsequent waste handlers. The UW rule\ndoes not change this allocation of responsibility.\nGenerators are responsible for subsequent mismanagement under CERCLA, however.\nThe UW rule does not change CERCLA liability. Since UW are still hazardous wastes,\npersons who generate UW remain liable under CERCLA for remediation of any releases of\nUW.\n12. When UW is shipped to a destination facility, does it have to be relabeled as HW at that\nfacility, or will UW labeling be sufficient?\nUniversal wastes remain hazardous wastes. Destination facilities must comply with all\ncurrently applicable requirements for hazardous waste management facilities. However, none\nof these regulations require facility owners or operators to relabel the containers holding\nuniversal wastes.\n13a. Handlers can keep UW on site up to one year after the date it is received or generated. A\nyear after a handler has received a UW, can the UW go to another handler, or must it go to\ndestination facility?\n\nUniversal waste can only be sent off-site to another universal waste handler, destination\nfacility, or foreign destination. Theoretically, each receiving facility could accumulate the\nwaste for an entire year before sending it off to another handler, however, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\nb. Within that year, can the UW go to several handlers?\nYes, but states can adopt a more stringent rule that would prevent this. Also, although\ntheoretically wastes could go from one collection facility to another forever, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\n14. Pesticides that are included in FIFRA recalls can be managed under the UWR. Does this\napply to pesticides that have been included in past FIFRA recalls or just recalls instituted after\nthe UWR is adopted?\nThe timing of the recall is not significant. The UW rule is not limited to pesticides that are\nrecalled after the UW rule takes effect.\n15. Pesticides that are managed by farmers in accordance with 40 CFR 262.70 are not subject\nto the UW rules. Can farmers continue to dispose of pesticides recalled under FIFRA under\n262.70?\nYes, if a recall under FIFRA allows a farmer to dispose of a pesticide on his own property, he\nmay do so by complying with 262.70.\n16. How are mixtures of UW and HW regulated -- as a HW if the HW is listed or the mixture\ne~ibits a characteristic? If the HW is not listed, and the mixture of UW and HW does not\nexhibit a characteristic, does LDR apply to the mixture?\nThe UW rules apply only to wastes meeting the criteria for being classified as UW. They do\nnot apply to mixtures of UW wastes and ordinary, \"norruniversal\" hazardous wastes. Such\nmixtures are subject to the regular hazardous waste regulations.\nHowever, the status of mixtures of characteristic UW and characteristic hazardous\nwastes needs clarification. If the mixture no longer eachibits a characteristic, it would no\nlonger be classified as a hazardous waste, but would remain subject to the land disposal\nrestrictions. Formerly characteristic wastes are not excused from compliance with LDR\ntreatment standards merely because they cease to exhibit a characteristic.\nIn addition, two exceptions apply. First, mixtures of UW and conditionally exempt\nsmall quantity generator (CESQG) hazardous wastes are subject to UW rules. This is because\nCESQG hazardous wastes are exempt from regular Subtitle C regulation. See the UW\npreamble at 25510. By the same logic, mixtures of UW wastes and hazardous wastes\nexempted under the household hazardous waste provision are subject to the UW provisions\nrather than the regular hazardous waste provisions.\n\nThe normal hazardous waste mixture rules would apply to mixtures of UW and\nnonhazardous solid wastes. If the UW waste were a listed waste, the mixture would be\nregulated as HW (although initial handlers would be subject only to the UW rules). If the UW\nwere a characteristic waste, and the mixture ceased to exhibit the characteristic, the mixture\nwould be nonhazardous but LDR treatment requirements would continue to apply.\n17. A large quantity universal waste handler (LQHLJW) is required to notify EPA of its\nuniversal waste management, unless it had already so notified and received an EPA ID\nnumber. However, won't the LQHUW have to modify the initial notification to explain this\nadditional activity?\nNo. If a handler has previously notified EPA of his hazardous waste management activities,\nhe is not required to renotify. First time notifiers can submit aone-time notification described\nin 40 CFR 273.32(b), or alternatively, the 8700-12 notification form. If the 8700-12\nnotification form is used, the LQHUW must write \"LQHIJW\" or \"Universal Waste\" on the\nportion of the form where activity is checked.\n18. Does the UWR prohibit a generator from handling a UW in accordance with full RCRA C\nrequirements, if desired?\nThe UWR requires a generator to handle their UW under 273. However, if the generator\nhandles UW under full RCRA C then it would likely be complying with 273.\n19. If a generator originates a shipment of hazardous waste that is considered a UW in the\nreceiving state, how does the generator get a signed manifest?\nThe initiating facility (i.e., the generator) would complete a manifest and give copies to the\nhazardous waste transporter as required under 40 CFR 262.23(a). The initiating facility must\nensure that the manifest is forwarded to and signed by the UW receiving facility (i.e., the\ndesignated TSD facility) and then sent back to the initiating facility.\n20. a. Because a manifest is now not required, how will handlers know how and when their\nUW finally arrives at an appropriate destination facility?\nDepending on whether the UW are shipped to another UW handler or a UW destination\nfacility, the initiating facility (i.e., the generator) may not know if their UW arrives at an\nappropriate destination facility. For example, if the universal waste is shipped to another\nuniversal waste handler (i.e., an interim facility) before it is shipped to a designated facility,\nthe originating facility would only have knowledge of the initial receiving facility. (See\nresponse to question 11). However, if the originating facility (i.e., the generator) sent the\nuniversal waste to a destination facility, Part 273 requires the originating facility to receive\nprior consent by a receiving facility (i.e., the destination facility) before the waste can be sent\noff-site.\n\nb. Does EPA intend for the original handler to \"designate\" all the handlers and final\ndestination facility?\nNo. The original handler (i.e., the initiating facility) is only responsible for designating the\nnext UW handler (though the original handler is free to elect to designate the final destination\nfacility)\n21. What happens when UWR is adopted by a state but is not yet authorized by EPA? What\nis EPA obligated to enforce?\nEPA may only enforce the authorized state program. The authorized program would continue\nto impose regular hazardous waste management standards on UW handlers until EPA\napproved the state's UW rule. Note, however, that once the rule is approved, designations of\nnew, state-only UW and management standards for such wastes become part of the authorized\nprogram without action by EPA. See the response to question 5 above.\nThe Agency has also issued a memorandum (See the April 10, 1996 Memorandum\naddressed to the Regional Administrators from Steven A. Herman, Assistant Administrator of\nthe Office of Enforcement and Compliance and Elliot P. Laws, Assistant Administrator of the\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response) which asks the EPA Regional offices to\nexercise enforcement discretion (vis a vis unmanifested universal wastes) in States that are\nauthorized for the RCRA base program and that are implementing the Part 273 standards but\nhave not yet received final EPA authorization to do so. The memorandum further provides\nthat the Regions should take enforcement actions involving universal waste only where\nhandlers of such wastes are not in full compliance with the Part 273 standards. In other words,\nthe Agency will not take federal action against handlers who manage hazardous waste\nbatteries, hazardous waste pesticides, and mercurycontaining thermostats pursuant to Part 273\nstandards in States that are currently in the process of adopting the universal waste rule.\nStates, of course, may still pursue enforcement action against these handlers. The Agency\nhopes that the April 10, 1996 letter will facilitate implementation of the universal waste rule\nby states nationwide.\n22. How are recycling facilities that receive UW regulated?\nRecycling facilities are excluded from the definition of UW \"handlers\". See 40 CFR 273.6.\nThey are subject to normal hazardous waste management requirements. Under those\nrequirements, storage prior to recycling is regulated and requires a permit. See 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (1). Many types of recycling processes are largely exempt from regulation (see 40\nCFR 261.6(d)); others (such as burning to recover energy or materials) are regulated and\nrequire permits.\n\nATTACHMENT 17\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOFFICE OF\nSOLID WASTE AND\nEMERGENCY\nRichard J. Barlow, Chair\nNortheast Waste Management Officials' Association (NEWMOA)\n129 Portland Street, Suite 601\nBoston, MA 02114-2014\nDear Mr. Barlow:RESPONSE\nI am pleased to respond to your May 23,1996 letter, in which you support the\nState of New York Department of Environmental Conservation rulemaking petition\nregarding 40 CFR Part 263 relative to the transportation of hazardous waste. I also\nunderstand that you have serious concerns about the recent preemption determination\nby the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) which was published on December 6,\n1995. (See 60 FR 62527). Specifically, you desire more regulatory oversight than is\ncurrently provided by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)\nregulations for hazardous waste activities at transfer facilities.\nAs you know, the recent DOT preemption decision cited in your letter arose from\na challenge lodged by the transporter industry against certain New York State\nregulations pertaining to activities at hazardous waste transfer facilities. Briefly, the\nState had enacted regulations which, among other things, prohibited certain load\nmixing activities at transfer facilities, and imposed secondary containment requirements\nin areas of these facilities reserved for off-vehicle storage. There is no federal\ncounterpart to these state regulations in EPA's Part 263 regulations, and DOT's\nregulations do not impose similar restrictions. In the decision published in the Federal\nRegister of December 6,1995, DOT held that each of the challenged State regulations\nwas preempted, because each was inconsistent with the uniform scheme of federal\nregulation which Congress intended for the control of interstate transportation of\nhazardous materials.\nWe are well aware of the long-standing interest of the States in the issues\nsurrounding the regulation of hazardous waste transfer facilities. I also understand that\nunless and until there are revisions to the federal regulations governing transfer\nfacilities, States which act alone to fill the perceived gaps in the federal RCRA\ntransporter regulations (40 CFR Part 263) are likely to face similar challenges under the\nstrong preemption authorities included by Congress in the 1990 amendments to the\nHazardous Materials Transportation act (HMTA).\nRO 14135\n\nWhile I understand the resource issues that States are facing when they are\nforced to defend the validity of their laws before DOT or the courts, I note that this\npredicament arises primarily from the manner in which the Congress has allocated\nresponsibility among the federal agencies and the States in the transportation area. The\nCongress has spoken in fairly unequivocal terms in RCRA 3003(b) that RCRA\nrequirements addressing transporters must be consistent with the HMTA and\nregulations issued thereunder. The HMTA in turn provides DOT with considerable\nauthority to preempt inconsistent State laws, particularly in certain of the so-called\n\"covered areas\" of hazardous materials regulation affected by New York's contested\nrequirements, or, in those instances where inconsistent State laws would pose an\nobstacle to accomplishing or cat-tying out the HMTA's scheme of regulation. See 49\nU.S.C. '5125. These types of strong preemption authorities are quite foreign to RCRA,\nbut they are introduced into the transporter area by the statutory directive in RCRA to\nmaintain consistency with the DOT framework.\nOn March 1,1996, the Office of Solid Waste (OSW) stated to Commissioner\nZagata of New York that OSW could not at this time commit our scarce federal\nrulemaking resources to the transfer facility problem without diverting resources from\nwhat I believe to be greater priorities for the RCRA program as a whole. This is still true\ntoday. However, at such time as our resources and priorities permit, we will revisit the\nmerits of committing resources to resolving the transfer facility concerns. I do, however,\nappreciate NEWMOA's interest in supporting such a rulemaking.\nI would like to be able to respond more positively to your letter at this time, but I\nknow that our state partners understand that in these times, we must allocate our\nresources and energies judiciously. Thank you for bringing these concerns and\nsuggestions to my attention. We appreciate the efforts of NEWMOA and its state\nmembers for their strong support for improving the RCRA program\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 14135\n\nATTACHMENT Z S\n\n9461.1994(02)\nSTORAGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AT TRANSFER FACILITIES AND THE\nAUTHORIZATION OF STATES REGULATING THIS STORAGE\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nAugust 17, 1994\nCharles Dickhut\nChemical Waste Transportation Institute\n4301 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nSuite 300\nWashington, D.C. 20008\nDear Mr. Dickhut,\nThank you for your letter of June 3,1994, in which you\nrequest that EPA clarify and reaffirm its interpretations and\npolicies regarding the storage of hazardous waste at transfer\nfacilities, the authorization of states for provisions regulating\nthis storage, and the preemption of such provisions by the\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) under the Hazardous Materials\nTransportation Act (HMTA).\nIn your letter you request that EPA reaffirm specific\nprevious interpretations of the 10-day storage limitation for\ntransfer facilities. RCRA regulations at 40 CFR 263.12 state that\n\"a transporter who stores manifested shipments of hazardous waste\nin containers meeting the requirements of 262.30 at a transfer\nfacility for a period of ten days or less is not subject to\nregulation under Parts 270, 264, 265, and 268 of this chapter with\nrespect to the storage of those wastes.\" These regulations do not\nrestrict the use of multiple transfer facilities for one shipment\nnor do they place further restrictions on the number of days\navailable at each facility (i.e., they do not limit the total\nnumber of days spent at all transfer facilities to 10). Of course,\neach transfer facility must meet the definition found at 260.10.\nA key element of the 260.10 definition is the \"normal course\nof transportation.\" Storage of manifested shipments of hazardous\nwaste at a transfer facility must be within the normal course of\nRO 13692\n\ntransportation. As the Agency has stated in the past, EPA can\nenvision situations in which hazardous waste maybe stored atone\ntransfer facility for 10 days, and then be stored at a second\ntransfer facility for. an additiona110 days, and remain within the\nnormal course of transportation (see the attached June 7,1990\nletter from Sylvia Lawrence to Robert Duprey and the June 22,1994,\nletter from Michael Petruska to Kevin Igli).\nYour letter also asked for clarification of the phrase \"normal\ncourse of transportation.\" The 10-day storage limitation at\ntransfer facilities was based on information provided by the\ntransportation industry, which indicated that shipments of\nhazardous waste normally take no longer than 15 days, including\nboth the actual transportation and the temporary holding of the\nshipment (see 45 FR 86966, December 31,1980). Individual\ncircumstances, however, may prevent shipments from being completed\nwithin this time period. EPA believes that what constitutes \"the\nnormal course of transportation\" depends on the particular facts of\neach case. Therefore, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to\nset a generic time limit beyond which a shipment would\nautomatically be outside the normal course of transportation.\nYou next inquire whether the authorization of a provision\naffecting the storage of hazardous wastes at transfer facilities\nunder 3006 of RCRA would make that provision no longer subject to\npreemption under the HMTA because it was \"otherwise authorized by\nFederal law.\" (See 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a).) EPA formulated its\ncurrent position on RCRA state authorization and preemption under\nthe HMTA during the 1992 authorization of California for the base\nRCRA program. EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to use\nthe RCRA Subtitle C authorization process to make specific\ndeterminations of possible preemption under the HMTA. Pursuant to\nthe HMTA, the DOT has established procedures both for making\npreemption determinations and providing waivers from preemption.\nA possible issue of preemption under HMTA would not affect the\nprogram's eligibility for RCRA authorization where the preemption\nconcern is unrelated to RCRA authorities. (See 57 FR 32726, July\n23,1992, and the attached October 29, 1992, letter from Devereaux\nBarnes to Cynthia Hilton). Thus, EPA still believes that the RCRA\nauthorization decisions provide no basis for shielding state\nregulations touching upon hazardous materials transport from\npossible preemption challenges raised under the HMTA.\nFinally, you ask whether EPA has the authority to review a\nRO 13692\n\nstate's interpretation of an authorized provision. You cite the\nArkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology's (DPC&E)\ninterpretation of the 10-day transfer facility storage limitation\nas a cause for concern. According to your letter, the DPC&E\nenforces a 10-day storage limitation that applies to the total\nstorage time at all transfer facilities, not the storage time at\neach one. Although EPA has a different interpretation than what\nyou have described for the DPC&E, the state of Arkansas is\nauthorized for the transporter requirements, and thus has primary\nauthority for implementing them. EPA's response to a state's\ninterpretation of an authorized provision would depend on how it\nwas implemented in a particular situation, and factors such as any\nrelevant state court decisions or an enforcement action. EPA is\ncurrently not aware of any instance where this differing\ninterpretation has been implemented. Further, EPA believes that\nthe question of whether Arkansas' interpretation deviates from\nnational HMTA transportation standards should be addressed under\nthe HMTA preemption process, rather than through RCRA state\nauthorization.\nI hope that this clarification is of assistance to you.\nFurther guidance regarding the issues you have raised maybe\navailable in the future, as a result of EPA discussions with DOT.\nIf you have further questions regarding the authorization of states\nfor the regulation of hazardous waste transporters and transfer\nfacilities, please contact Wayne Roepe of my staff at 703-308-8630.\nIf you have further questions regarding the EPA regulations\nregarding the transportation of hazardous waste, please contact Ann\nCodrington of my staff at 202-260-4777.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 13692\n\nATTACHMENT 19\n\n9541.1985(07)\nRCRA/SUPERFUND HOTLINE MONTHLY SUMMARY\nMAY 85\nManifest Use and State Authorization\n3. A spent solvent, which is hazardous by characteristic only (e.g.\nignitable D001), is transported from the generator in Montana, to a\nreclamation facility in Texas. Both Montana and Texas are states with\nfinal authorization for the RCRA program. The transporter will also go\nthrough Wyoming which is anon-authorized state (i.e., it is under the\nFederal RCRA program).\nPursuant to 40 CFR ~261.6(a), characteristic hazardous wastes which are\nreclaimed are not subject to RCRA regulations. According to ~261.2(c)\nas amended by the January 4,1985, Federal Register (50 FR 614), however,\nall spent solvents, characteristic or listed, will be defined as \"spent\nmaterials\" and will be regulated as \"solid wastes\" prior to reclamation.\nThus, per ~261.6(b), in the January 4,1985, rule, generators and\ntransporters of recyclable hazardous materials (e.g., spent solvents) are\nsubject to Parts 262 and 263 (generator and transporter standards,\nrespectively). The complicating factor is that this new definition of\nsolid waste and respective recycling regulations may go into effect at\ndifferent times through the country depending on whether a state is\nauthorized or not.\nThe January 4, 1985, rule will be effective in non-authorized states on\nJuly 5,1985. States with final authorization, such as Montana and\nTexas, may have up to January 4,1987, to adopt this rule. Therefore,\na characteristic ignitable spent solvent will be a regulated hazardous\nwaste prior to reclamation in non-authorized states on July 5,1985. In\nthe transport situation described above, is the transporter required to\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest in Wyoming, since the spent\nsolvent is a \"hazardous waste\" in Wyoming on July 5,1985?\nIf the spent solvent is transported from Montana to Texas (EPA-\nauthorized states) after July 5,1985, the transporter need not\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest, even though the spent\nsolvent is transported through Wyoming, which regulates the\nsolvent as a RCRA waste. States through which the waste shipment\ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements per 49 FR 1049\nRO 12399\n\n(March 20, 1984). When either the generator state (Montana) or\nthe designated state (Texas) determines that the waste is\nhazardous, that waste will be subject to the Uniform Manifest\nrequirements.\nSource: Denise Hawkins (202) 382-2231\nRO 12399\n\nATTACHMENT ZO\n\nRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potential Costs,\nBenefits, and Other Impacts of the Final Hazardous Waste\nGenerator Improvements Rule\nPrepared for\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nOffice of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR)\n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW (Mailstop 5305P)\nWashington DC, 20460 USA\nSeptember 2016\n\n2.3 HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED FACILITIES\nThis section characterizes the hazardous waste generation of facilities in the regulated universe. The\noverall tonnages of hazardous waste and the number of waste streams are relevant to estimating the cost\nof managing this waste in compliance with the provisions of the final rule. The methodology for\nestimating the quantities of hazardous waste generation varies by generator status. Where possible, this\nRIA relies on generation data from EPA's 2013 BR database. The BR database is used to develop annual\naggregate and per facility generation estimates for LQG facilities. For other facility types, however, the\ndata available from the BR database are insufficient to develop nationwide hazardous waste generation\nestimates. Consequently, this RIA derives generation estimates for SQGs and VSQGs by combining the\nlimited data available in the BR database with facility-level generation data obtained from individual\nstates.\n2.3.1 LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION\nEPA's 2013 BR database is the primary data source for estimating hazardous waste generation for LQG\nfacilities. In 2013, LQGs generated approximately 35.2 million tons of hazardous waste in aggregate.\nCombining this value with the LQG facility count presented above suggests that LQGs, on average,\ngenerate approximately 1,692 tons of hazardous waste per facility per year.14 The BR data also suggest\nthat LQGs reported an average of 13 different waste streams per facility, with a few large facilities\nreporting several thousand waste streams. The SO largest LQGs generated 29.2 million tons of hazardous\nwaste, or 83 percent of the total amount reported in the 2013 BR.\nExhibit 2-5 reports the overall and average per facility hazardous waste quantities generated on an annual\nbasis as well as the average number of waste streams per facility for LQGs by state. As shown in the\nexhibit, the Gulf States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi account for approximately 63 percent of all\nhazardous waste generated by LQGs in the United States. In contrast, New York and California, which\nhave the largest number of LQG facilities, collectively account for just 5 percent of all hazardous waste\ngenerated by LQGs.\nExhibit 2-6 provides information on the distribution of LQGs by industry. Facilities in the BR database\nmay be characterized by one or several North American Industry Classification System (NAILS) codes.\nTo avoid double-counting, this RIA uses the first (or primary) NAILS code listed in the BR database for a\nfacility. As shown in the exhibit, the five largest industries (in terms of hazardous waste generation)\naccount for approximately 95 percent of all hazardous waste generated by LQGs, while comprising less\nthan 20 percent of all LQGs. These industries include: chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); petroleum\nand coal products manufacturing (NAILS 324); waste management and remediation services (NAILS\n562); primary metal manufacturing (NAILS 331); and mining (NAILS 212). In terms of the number of\ngenerators, the largest industries \u2014accounting for approximately 50 percent of the LQG universe \u2014\ninclude: health and personal care stores (NAILS 446); chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); utilities\n(NAILS 221); fabricated metal product manufacturing (NAILS 332); and general merchandise stores\n(NAILS 452).\n~~ This average (mean) value includes a small number of facilities that generate more than one mill(on tons of hazardous waste per year. Thus,\nwhereas the mean generation value per LQG is 1,692 tons per year, the median (50'~ percentile) is only 7.6 tons per year. Because the cost and\nbenefit calculations in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively, do not use LQG waste generation as an Input (incremental costs and benefits for LQGs\nunder the rule are not dependent on waste quantities), the choice of using the mean or median has no impact on the estimated costs and benefits\nof the rule.\n2-9\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nSTATE\nANUMBER OF\nFACILITIES\nIN BR DATA\nBTOTAL HAZARDOUS\nWASTE GENERATED\n(TONS)\nCPERCENTAGE OF\nTOTAL\nHAZARDOUS\nWASTE\n[D]HAZARDOUS WASTE\nGENERATED PER\nFACILITY\n(TONS)\nE=C/BAVERAGE\nNUMBER OF\nWASTE STREAMS\nPER FACILITY\n[F]\nAlabama\nAlaska386\n27708,436\n2,272\n73,948\n405,592\n1,519,549\n37,0002.0%\n0.0%1,835\n8413\n20\nArizona\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nColorado\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nDistrict of Columbia210\n101\n2,775\n108\n416\n60\n36\n386\n517\n90.2% 352 17\n1.2% 4,016 27\n4.3% 548 13\n0.1%\n0.1%343\n4760\n19,666 12\n14,886\n551\n107, 387\n280, 866\n165\n466,293\n4,624\n613,053\n1,026,7080.0% 248 40\n0.0% 15 8\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nGuam\nHawaii\nIdaho\nIllinois\nIndiana\nIowa\nKansas0.3%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n1.3%\nO.OY\n1.7%\n2.9%278 16\n543 11\n18 70\n23\n23\n836-710\n144\n21320,274 35\n201 28\n733 10- -- -- -----1,446 13\n51, 095 0.1 % 355 9\n1,349,985 3.8% 6,338 9\nKentuc\nLouisiana\nMaine\nMa land297\n368\n87\n469\n415\n493\n340\n~ 164\n330\n62\n1194,945 0.6% 656 27\n4,789,750 13.6%\n0.0%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n1.8%\n1.0%\n4.5%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n0.0%13,016 11\n3,048 35 8\n47,995 102 9\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMississippi\nMissouri\nMontana\nNavajo Nation\nNebraska\nNevada29,285 71\n1,274\n1,029\n9,695\n854\n114\n3\n424\n15614\n17\n9627,889\n349,886\n~ 1,590,017 7\n281,820 11\n7,065 9\n3\n29, 225\n14,688\n3,293\n396,104\n889,2564\n22\n13\n42\n_ 48\n8769 0.1 %\n94\n1340.0%\nNew Hampsh ire\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico0.0%\n1.1%25\n711 557\n41 2.5%_\n21,689\nNew York 3,095 234,378\n77,163\n375,751\n00.7% 76 4\n22\n6\n0North Carolina 675 0.2%\n1.1q\n0.0%114\n14,452\n0North Dakota 26\nNorthern Marianas 0\nOhio 975 1,539,561 4.4% 1,579 16\nOklahoma 170 100, 331 0.3% 590 7\nOre on 210 56,930 0.2% 271 10\nPenns lvania 1,004 257,716 0.7%\n0.1%\n0.0%257\n382\n598\n22\n17Puerto Rico 94 35,902\nRhode Island 103 6,083\nSouth Carolina 386 176,950 0.5% 458 8\nSouth Dakota 31 1,460 0.0% 47 7\nTennessee 363 97,020 0.3% 267 6\nTexas 970 15,624,473 44.4% 16,108 7\nTrust Territories 0 0 0.0% 0 0\nUtah 127 40,359 0.1% 318 28\n2-10\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nPERCENTAGE OFHAZARDOUS WASTE AVERAGE\nNUMBER OF TOTAL HAZARDOUS TOTAL GENERATED PER NUMBER OF\nFACILITIES WASTE GENERATED HAZARDOUS FACILITY WASTE STREAMS\nSTATE IN BR DATA (TONS) WASTE (TONS) PER FACILITY\n[A] B C D [E=C/B F]\nVermont 43 3,323 0.0% 77 12\nVirgin Islands 1 10,064 0.0%~ 10,064 17\nVirginia 397 58,641 0.2%~ 148 12\nWashington 258,975 0.7% 568 16 456\nWest Virginia 144 52,027 0.1% 361 10\nWisconsin--424 204, 520__\n0.6% 482 9\nWyoming 22 3,493 0.0~ 159 13\nTOTALz 20,771 35,151,466 100.0% 1, 692 13\nNotes:\n1.

Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (OS-300)\nTO: Karl E. Bremer, Chief\nRCRA Permitting Branch\nOffice of RCRA, Region 5 (HRP-8J)\nThis is in response to your memorandum of November 20,1992\nregarding Heritage Environmental Services, Inc. in Lemont,\nIllinois, and the burning of a propellant mixture (mostly butane\nand propane) in the company's boiler. You specifically asked\nwhether the burning of this mixture constitutes burning of a\nhazardous waste which would require them to comply with the boiler\nand industrial furnace (BIF) regulations.\nSubpart H of 40 CFR Part 266 regulates the burning or\nprocessing of hazardous waste in boilers and industrial furnaces.\nHowever, before a substance can be classified as a hazardous waste,\nit must first meet the definition of a solid waste. In determining\nwhether the butane and propane propellants are solid wastes, it\nmust also be decided whether the burning of these materials\nconstitutes the burning for energy recovery of a propellant (is a\nsolid waste), or use as a fuel (is not a solid waste) for the\nreasons stated below.\nAs stated in your memo, Heritage plans to recover the\nmaterials from the aerosol cans and separate them into three\nstreams: (1) scrap metal (crushed cans), (2) a liquid phase\n(household chemicals), and (3) a gaseous phase (propellants, mostly\nbutane and propane). Heritage then plans to burn the recovered\npropellants from the aerosol cans in their on-site boiler for\nRO 11717\n\nenergy value.\nAccording to 40 CFR Section 261.2(c)(2)ii regulations,\ncommercial chemical products that are listed in 40 CFR Section\n261.33 as well as non-listed commercial chemical products that\nexhibit hazardous waste characteristics (see attached Apri111,\n1985 Federal Register notice explaining the regulatory status of\nnon-listed commercial chemical products), are not classified as\nsolid wastes when burned for energy recovery if they are themselves\nfuels. Since propane and butane are materials that are normally\nboth used as fuels, when unused, they can be burned as fuels\nwithout being considered solid wastes.\nTherefore, if the aerosol cans are full (not used), or\npartially full (in which case they would be considered off\nspecification with the remaining propellants in the cans also being\nunused), then the butane and propane propellants would be\nclassified as commercial chemical products. Since these products\nare fuels and being burned for energy recovery, they would not fall\nwithin the definition of a solid waste and would consequently not\nbe considered a hazardous waste.\nFor the reasons stated above, Heritage would not be required\nto comply with the BIF regulations to burn the butane and propane\npropellants in their on-site boiler. However, this determination\nassumes that other hazardous constituents have been separated from\nthe butane and propane propellants, and that the butane and propane\nare indeed being burned for energy recovery rather than to destroy\nother hazardous constituents contained in the aerosol cans.\nIf you have any additional questions or would like to discuss\nthis further, please contact Karen Randolph of my staff on (703)\n308-8651.\nAttachment\ncc: Christine Dibble, OSW; Mike Petruska, CAD; Steve\nSilverman, OGC; Bob Holloway, WMD; Sonya Sasseville, PSPD\nbcc: Juana Rojo, Region 5; Waste Combustion Permit Writers'\nWorkshop; Karen Randolph PSPD\nRO 11717\n\nATTACHMENT 22\n\n9432.1988(04)\nAEROSOL CANS, ON-SITE DEPRESSURIZATION OF\nOFFICE OF SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nSEP 1988\nKurt E. Whitman, Project Coordinator\nSWInc.\nP.O. Box B\nSaukville, WI 53080\nDear Mr. Whitman:\nThis is in response to your July 1,19881etter requesting\nclarification on EPA's current interpretation on whether the\ndepressurization of aerosol cans on-site would be considered\ntreatment, requiring a RCRA permit. You also requested\npertinent information on Ril #43 and on whether or not it has\nbeen rescinded. I am enclosing per your request a copy of Ril\n43 and the 1985 memorandum which I believe is the one you are\nrequesting.\nYou revealed in a July 26, 1988 telephone conversation with\nDoreen Sterling of my staff that your main interest in this\nissue was to determine the requirements for disposal of a wide\nvariety of aerosol cans located at a number of Department of\nDefense facilities throughout the country.\nThe Agency is aware that conflicting interpretations have\nbeen given by the EPA Regional Offices, EPA Office of Solid\nWaste, and the RCRA Hotline regarding whether certain aerosol\ncan disposal methods constitute treatment and whether or not a\npermit is required for this activity. The Agency is currently\nevaluating this problem and may decide to issue more specific\nguidance in the future if it is warranted. It is our policy,\nhowever, to refer issues of this nature to the Region in which\nthe facility is located since they are normally best able to\nmake acase-by-case determination on whether: (1) the waste in\nquestion is hazardous according to our regulations and\n(2) treatment is occurring.\nRO 13225\n\nAccording to our regulations, cans are hazardous if: (1)\nthey contain a commercial chemical product on the 40 CFR\n261.33(e) or (f) lists or exhibit one or more of the hazardous\nwaste charactreistics, and are not empty as defined under Sec.\n261.7; and/or (2) they exhibit any of the characteristics of\nhazardous waste identified in Part 261, Subpart C.\nTreatment, as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, means any method,\ntechnique, or process, including neutralization, designed to\nchange the physical, chemical, or biological character or\ncomposition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such\nwaste, or so as to recover energy or material resources from the\nwaste, or so as to render such waste nonhazardous, or less\nhazardous; safer to transport, store, or dispose of; or amenable\nfor recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume.\nIt should be noted that if any of the aerosol cans are\nincluded as part of household waste (i.e., from military\nhousing), those cans are exempt from RCRA Subtitle under\nSection 261.4(b)(1).\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact Doreen\nSterling of my staff at 202-475-6775.\nSincerely\nOriginal Document signed\nSylvia K Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nEnclosures\nRO 13225\n\nATTACHMENT 23\n\nPPC 9443.1984(10)\nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION REACTIVITY, OFF SPECIFICATION\n30 NOV 1984\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT: Classification of Small Arms Ammunition\nWith Respect to Reactivity\nFROM: John H. Skinner, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (WH-562)\nTO: David Wagoner, Director\nAir &Waste Management Division\nRegion VIII\nRecently, a question arose as to the status under RCRA of\noff-specification small arms ammunition (ball or sporting\nammunition of calibers up to and including 0.50) intended for\ndisposal. The issue concerned whether such wastes are \"reactive\nwastes\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6) and, therefore,\nsubject to RCRA hazardous waste requirements. Because the\nammunition contains an ignition source that maybe shock and heat\nsensitive and is designed to generate high pressure during use, it\nhad been our opinion that it is probably \"reactive.\" However, on\nthe basis of information that was received from the Remington\nArms Company and the Army, we now conclude that such materials\nare no \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).\nSection 261.23 (a)(6) of Title 40 provides that a solid\nwaste which is \"capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it\nis subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under\nconfinement\" is \"reactive.\" As discussed in the May 19, 1980,\npreamble to 40 CFR 261.23, shock and thermal instability are\nimportant elements of this definition. While presently there is\nno Agency guidance regarding these criteria, the Remington Arms\nCompany of Independence, Missouri, and the U.S. Army have provided\ninformation which addresses both of these factors.\nRemington Arms Company submitted details on the effects of\nheat and impact to small arms ammunition. There was no explosion\nRO 12339\n\nwhen a box of ammunition was set afire. Small arms, when subjected\nto the SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute)\nImpact Test, showed no evidence of mass propagation or explosion.\nThe Department of the Army has a rigorous safety and hazard\ntesting program on all munition items. The tests, which include\ndrop tests from 5, 7, and 40 feet to simulate handling errors\nand \"heating under confinement,\" 160\u00b0F for 48 hours, also\nshowed no evidence of detonation or explosion with respect to\nsmall arms ammunition. The tests were performed on both the\nindividual munition and a package containing a prescribed number\nof items.\nAs noted above, we feel that results from these tests show\nthat off-specification small caliber ammunition up to and including\n0.50 is not \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR ~261.23(a)(6).\nWe, therefore, believe that the disposal of such ammunition is not\nsubject to Subtitle C hazardous waste requirements.\nWe appreciate your cooperation.

The Agency has determined that reactivi:v\nis a hazardous character~skic,because improperly managed\nreactive wastes (i.e. , explosives, etc.) pose a substantial\npresent or potential danger to human health and the environment.\nThe purpose of this document is to explain the Agency's\ndefinikion of reactive wastes, to discuss the comments received\non the proposed definition of reactive waste (43 FR 58956,\nDecember 18, 2978) and the changes subsequently made.\nII. Proposed Regulation\nReactive waste. (1) Definition - A solid waste is a\nhazardous waste if a representative sample of the vasCe:~\n(i) Is normally unstable and readily undergoes violent\nchemical change without detonating; reacts violently with\neater, Forms potentially explosive mixtures with water, o-\ngenerates toxic gases, vapors, or fumes when mixed with water;\n-2-\n\nor is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate\ntoxic gases, vapors, ox fumes when exposed to mild acidic or\nbasic conditions.\n(zi) Is capable o~ detonation or expZasive reac~ion but\nrequires a strong initiating source or which must be heated\nunder confinement before initiation can take place, or which\nreacts explosively with water.\n(iii) Is readily capable of detonation ar of explosive\ndecomposition or reaction at normal temperatures and pressuzes.\n(iv) Is a Forbidden explosive as defined in 49 CF R\n173.51, a Class A explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.53, or a\nClass B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.58.\nNOTE --Such waste includes pyrophoric.substances,\nexplosives, autopolymeri'zation material and oxiaizing\nagents. If it i~ not apparent whether a waste is a\nhazardous waste using this description, then the\nmethods cited below or equivalent methods can be used\nko determine if the waste is hazardous waste.\nIdenti~ication method. (1) Thermally unstable waste\ncan he identified using the Explosion Temperature Test cited\nin Appendix II of this Subpart (waste for which explosion,\nignition, ar decomposition occurs at 125\"C after 5 r~nutes is\nclassed as hazardous waste).\n(i) Waste unstable to mechanical shock can be i~entif~ed\n\u2022 using the Bureau of Explosives impact apparatus and the tests\ncited in 49 CFR 173.53 (b), {c), (d}, or {f), as aparooria~e.\n_,~\n\nIII. Rationale for Proposed Regulation\nA. Rationale far proposing a reactivity characteristic\nReactivity was chosen as a characteristic of hazardous\nwastie because improperly managed reactive wastes present a\ndanger to human health and the environment. By definition,\nreactive wastes are those which are capable of violently\ngenerating heat and pressure, reacting vigorously with air or\nwater, reacting with water to generate toxic Fumes, etc. The\ndangers which these wastes pose to transporters, waste disposal\npersonnel, and the public are thus for the most part obvious.\nIn the past, there have been a number of incidents of damage\nto persons or property which have resulted from the improper\nrtanagement of reactive wastes. Sorne of these damage incidents\nare listed and discussed in Appendix I.\nBecause of their acknowledged danger, reactive materials\naxe often controlled by federal and state regulations and\nsuggestions for their safe use or management are oFten\npublished by public or private organizations. Some o\u00a3 these\nfederal and state regulations and the guideline's for reactive\nmaterials prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association\n(NFPA) .are lzsted and discussed in Appendix II.\nB. Rationale for proposed reactivity definition\nReactive substances can be described as those which:\nI) autopolymerize\n2) are unstable with respect to heat or shock\n3) are explosive\n_~-\n\n4) are strong oxidizers\n5) react vigorously with air or Water\n6) react with water to generate toxic fumes\nAs can be seen from this description, Lhe tern \"reac~ivitq\"\nencompasses a diverse and somewhat loosely conjoined class of\nphysical properties or effects. These effects are not mu~ually\nzxclusive and a particulaz substance might exhibit several of\nthe properties mentioned above. For instance, ce::ain\nperoxides would fall into four of the above six ca~egories.\nAdditionally, these categories overlap not only wi:h each\nother, but also with the other characteristics. For exa~~le,\nthe difference between flammability ~confla\u00a2rzCioa} and eti-\nplosiveness (deflagration) is only one ofdegree -- an illustra-\nlion of the fact that the properties enbrac?d by tie terx\n\"reactivity\" are, like the term \"reactivitq\" itse?~, relztive\nproperties which have meaning only in a relative sense.\nThe Agency has aCtempted where possible to de_ine\nhazardous waste characCeristics in terms of speciric,\nnumerically quanti.\u00a3ied properties measurable by standardized\nand available testing protocols. This has aroven 3ifficult\nin the case o~ reactive wastes. The first oroble~ ~:ith\nconstructing a numerically quantified definition cf reactive\nwastes arises from the fact that Che tern \"reacti~ity\" e~~races\na wide variety of different (though overlapping) ~\u00b0sects,\neach of which can be triggered by an eaually Wide variety of\ninitiaCing conditions or forces. IC would 3e cum:?rsome, if\nnot completely impractical, to construct a :\u25bauneri~ally\n_5_\n\nquantified definition which included all these different\neffects and their potential initiating farces. The second\nproblem arises from the Fact, as noted above, that the\npropez~ies embraced by the term reactivity are relative\nproperties. The determination that something \"reacts vigorously\nwith air or water\" or a.s \"unstable with respect to heat or\nshock\" is a relative determination, not an absolute one. The\neffects bezng measured proceed along a continuum. Thus, it\nis ditfi.cult to draw the line at any particular point.\nThese problems are reflected in the testing methods\nwhich might be used to identify reactive substances. These\nmethods suffer from the following generic deficiences:\n1. The available tests are too specific and do not\nreflect the wide variety of waste management\nconditions.\nThe available tests are used to determine how a specific\naspect or manifestation of waste reactivity behaves under a\nspecia]. and specific type of stress. For example, DTA\n(Differential Thermal Analysis) measures how the rate of\ntemperature rise of the waste (one specific aspect of waste\nreactivity.) correJ.ates with the slow input of thermal energy\n(one special and specific type of stress) . This would not\nindicate how the waste reacts to mechanical shock (a drop\ntest would be necessary to determine that); electrical shock,\nwhether the waste is a strong oxidizer, or even what is\nproducing the rate of temperature cYiange (pressure buildup,\ntoxic or nontoxic L-'umes, heat of mixing, etc.). ~'he in~ormation\nderived fxom the available tests; then, is too specialized\n\nand does not reflect the wide varieCy of stresses and initiating\nforces likely to be found in a disposal environment.\n2. Reactivity of a sample may nor reflect reactivity of\nthe whole waste:\nIn the case of wastes which are thermally unstable, the\nreactivity of the sample map not adequately reflect the\nreactivity of the whole Waste. The kinetics of reaction are\nnot only a \u00a3unction of the available initiating sources and\nambient temperature, but are also a function of the mass,\nconfiguration, geometry, etc. of the sample. Foz a \"runaway\"\nreaction to occur, the system must transcend that steady\nsCate where the energy (heat) produced by reaction is equal\nto the energy transferred to the surroundings from the re-\nacting mass. When this critical temperature is reached, the\nmass experiences catastrophic self-heating. This heat\ntransfer phenomena is a tunct~on of sample s1ze, density, and\ngeometry. As demonstxaCed in equation 1:5\nCdtldt QVp exp (-E/RT) + hS (T - To) (1)\nC me (m=mass and c = specific heat)\nT = Temperature of the material\nQ ~ Heat of decoaposition\nV A Volume\np = Aensity\nE Activation energy\nR Gas constant\nh Keat transfer coefficient\nS = Surface are of the material\n_~_\n\nAs can be seen from this equation the rate of temperature\nrise will be affected both by the intensive properties of the\nwaste, such as density, and the expensive properties of the ,\nwaste, such as surface area and geometry. Since the extensive\nproperties o~ the sample are likely to be different from tie\nextensive properties of the whole waste, the reactivity of\nthe sample may not reflect the reactivity of the whole was~e.\n3. The test zesuZts are in most cases subjective or\nnet directly applicable.\nThe ideal test to use in a regulatory program is usually\none which zequires minimal interpretation. 'I~e majority o\u00b0\navailable reactivity testing methods are not o~ the \"nass-\nfail\" type. Rather, these testing methods usually produce\ntest results which consist o\u00a3 a first order differential\nplotted against time or against a standard, from which relative\nreactivity can be assessed. When a test of this sort is run,\nit is not run to determine \"reactivity\" per se 'gut rather ~a\nelicit information concerning how \"fast\" a material reacts\n(i.e. kinetic information) or how vigorously it reacts (thermo-\n3ynamic information). Thus, the decision as to whether a\nwaste is reactive requires subjective interpretation o~ the\ntest results.\nAdditionally, the information derived From such tests\nmay not be directly r~lated~to reactivity. for example, tie\ntest results might provide znformatian on the activateion\nenergy - a useful, but potentially misleading bit of information\nsince it reflects the speed of the reaction rasher than the\n\nreaction's effects. The inapplicabiLitq of some of the rest\nresults emphasizes the indefinite meaning of the term\n\"reacCivity\", a term which draws its meaning \u00a3rom the context\nof its use. A chemist might think of a \"reactive\" subsCance\nas one with a small activa[ion enezgy the energy difference\nbeCween the reactive substance's initial and transition\nstates), i.e., one which reacts easily. The Agency, however,\nunlike the hypothetical chemist, is not just interested in\nthings that react \"easily\" but also i.n~Chings which react\nvigorously. It consequently needs to take into account not\njust the activation energq of a substance but also the heat\no\u00a3 reaction, the molecu~arity o\u00a3 the reaction and a~her ,\nfactors - information which the available tests often do not\nsupply. It is, in other words, not really interested in\nperforming a Chermodynamic measurement, but rather in observing\ni\u00a3 a waste be:~aves in such a wzy as to pose a danger under\nnormal handling conditions.\n4. 'the standardized methods that do exist were not\nc~eveloped for waste testing.\nUse of the available testing methods on waste materials\noften resulCs in the applicaEion of standardized methods to\nnon standardized samples and the application of standardized\nmethods to samples with physical consistencies the method Was\nnat designed for. If such methods are used., the results\nmight be difficult to interpreC with cerCainty.\nThe available reacCi.vity testing methods are individuaLl.y\n-9-\n\ndescribed and evaluated in Appendix 3*. As is evident from\nthose specific evaluations and From the oreceeding discussion\nof the generic shortcomings of the available testing methods,\nnave of these \"type\" methods are suitable for use to\nunequivocally determine if a waste presents a reactive hazard.\nFar essentially the same reasons, a numerically quantified\ndefinition of reactive waste is not feasible. This is not as\nAig a problem as might be thought on initial reflection.\nMost generators whose wastes are dangerous because they are\nreactive are well aware of this property of their waste.\nReactive wastes present special problems in handXing, storage\nand transprot. Also, reactive wastes are rarely generated\nfrom unreactive feed stocks oX in processes producing unreactive\nproducts or intermediates. Furthermore, the problems posed\nby reactive was~es appear to be confine8 to a Fairly narrow\ncategory of wastes. The damage incidents show that the major\nproolems seem to be the formation of hydrogen sulfide (A2S)\nfrom either soluble sulfides or biological degradation o.f\nsulfur containing wastes, the formation of hydrogen cyanide\n(HCN) from soluble cyanides, and the explosion o\u00a3 some\n*These evaluations are taken from \"A Seeond Appraisal of\nMethods for Estimatin Selt Reaction Hazards\", E.

IC will thus onlq be in a\nrare insCance that a generator would be unsure of the reactivity\nclass of the waste, or would be unable Co assess whether the\nwaste fits a prose definition, and would require the application\nof testing p~orocols to determine the reactivity of Chis\nwaste. Since the available testing methods are not ideal\nfor identifying those wastes cateQoriz~d as hazardous due to\nreactivity, the approach chosen is to prescribe a.prose\ndescription of reactive waste far self-determination bq\ngenerators and to list wastes which meet this description and\nh ave been identified as reacCive.\nThe prose definition chosen is a paraphrase of the top\nthree of the reactive classes of the National Fire Protection\nassociation ~NFPA) reactivity classification system. The\nother two classes in the NFPA classification scheme are not\nincluded since Chese would include materials which are inert\nunder normal handling conditions.

Comments Received on the Proposed ~aracteristics\nand the Agency's Response to These Comments\nThe Agency received approximately forty comment letters\naddressing reactivity. These letters contained approximately\nsixty discrete recommendations or comrr.~n~s on tre proposed\nregulation (in some letters more than one point was addressed).\nSeveral of the commenters \u00a3elt that the proposed reactivity\ndefinition was adequate and pznvides dssirable flexibility\nfor the generator to. use judgement. A~wever, the large\nmajority o\u00a3 comments expressed concern with the Agency's\nreactivity characteristic. These cominen~s have been categorized\nby either contend or the portion of tre regulation addressed.\nA discussion of these follows:\nA. A large majority of the comments ~eal~ with the asserted\nlack of spee~fic~ty and ambiguity of tze prose definition.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued t~a~ the prose definition\nemployed by the Agency is, as a General mater, too\nvague and should be replaced by ~ numerically quanti-\nfied definition accompanied by aparopriate testing\nprotocols. This comment leas beer_ fully addressed in\nPart III above and need not be ac3ressed further here.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued ~z~t the inclusion in\nthe definition of wastes which \"Generate toxic gases,\nvapors, ox fumes when mixed wi`.~ water\" and of \"cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes] wn~~~. can generate toxic\ngases, vapors, oz fumes when e~~~s.e3 to mild acidic\n-14-\n\nor basic conditions\" needs to be made amore specific.\nSeveral of the commenters suggested that a phrase\nsuch as \"in harmful quantita.es\" be irse~tec into the\nproposed regulat~.ons as follows: \"...or ger_erates\ntoxic gases, vapors, or fumes in harnful aLantities\nwhen mixed with water\"; \"or is a cya~i~e or sulfide\nbearing waste which can generate toxic gases, vapors,\nor fumes in harmful quantities when exposed to mild .\nacidic or basic conditions.\" The comments on the\ncyanide and sulfide bearing. wastes all poi.^.fed out\nthat everything contains sulfides anc r,.ost =kings\ncontain cyanides (albeit in trace amoun~s) ~n3 many\no\u00a3 these can generate minute quai:tities of 1y3r~gen\nsulfide or hydrogen cy~nic~e under mildly acidi..c or\nbasic conditions. The Agency is sym~~.~:zeti^ ~o these\nconceicns, and, in antici.pata.on of such. orob'_e~s, had\nattempted to make clear in the preamble and background\ndocuments that khe Agency was leavi,na the determination\nof reactivity hazard up to the reasonable ~idc~ement\nof the generator based upon the generator's past\nexperience with the waste. Taka.ng t'nis coffin sense\napproach, such material as soil or flyash w~~.:~ suicides\n.contamination (examples of sulfide an3 ~yan~de bearing\nwastes supplied by the commenters) woul3 cls~,~ly rot\nmeet the reactivity definition. D~spit~ th'_s, the\npoint made by tY~e commenters is certainly v=lid. ^here-\nfore, so that there will be no confus=on; t::~ r~gen~y has\n-15-\n\nchanged the final regulation to make it more specific, as\nfollows: \"...or generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes:\nin quantities sufficient to preszrt a danger to public ,\nhealth or the environment when mixed with water; or is a\ncyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate toxic\ngases, vapors or fumes in quantities sufficient to pxesent a\ndanger to public health or the environment when exposed. ..\"\nThis would certainly better reflect our regulatory intent.\nA number of commenters advocated that the Agency specify\nwhat is meant by mildly acidic or basic conditions. One\ncommenter specified a pH range (5 to 9'), but offered no\nrationale as to why this particular range should be used.\nSince a 5ubstantal percentage of the commenters found the\nphrase \"m~idTy acidic or basic\" to be rather nebulous, the\nAgency has decided that a specific p~ range should be speei-\nfeed. The pH range chosen is thaw w'~ich is considered non-\nhazardous by the corrosivity charac~eristic (2 < pH <12.5).\n'Phis range was chosen because any li\u2022~uid outside the range\nis hazardous and requires management within the Subtitle C\nregulations. Only liquid wastes inside this range can be\nlandfilled without regard to the strictures on compatibility\nimposed by the Subtitle C regulations and co-disposed with\nwastes containing soluble cyanides or sulfides. These are\nthen the most stringent pH cvnditio~s which a waste could be\nsubjected to outside of a Subtitle C Facility. (natural\nwaters are unlikely to be outside this pH range).\n-16-\n\n\u00b0 Several commenters suggested that the definition of\ncyanide bearing waste should distinguish between \"\u00a3xee\ncyanide\" and ferro cyanide\" since the latter would not\nbe available to generate hydrogen cyanide under mild\nacidic or basic conditions. Thp Agency beleives that\nsuch a clarification is nat necessary. If the cyanide\nis unavailable under the s~eci\u00a3ied acidic or basic\nconditions then toxic hydrogen cyanide fumes cannot he\ngenerated and the wastes containing these unavailable\ncyanides are not reackive. To s~ec~fy these as exemp-\ntions would be redundant and by implication might lead\ngenerators to conclude that other unavailable sulfides\nor cyanides NOT specifically exempted, do neet the\nreactivity chazacteristic.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated~speci~ying the cancen-\ntration of sulfide or cyanide needed to make cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes hazardous. As explained above,\nthe identity of wastes which generate toxic gases under\nthe conditions specified in the ~efinition~should be\nobvious to the generator and thus, this level o\u00a3 sophi-\nstication~is unnecessary.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency specify a\nrate of evolution of toxic gas, but included no sugges-\ntions as to how to do so. The tigency is unsure of how\na laboratory test method measuring gas evolution rate\n-17-\n\ncould be developed which could then be neaning`ully\nrelated to field conditions. Therefore, an evoluticn\nrate of toxic gas will not be included in the final\nregulations.\n\u00b0 One commenter argued that sulfides and cyanides should\nnot be singled out in-the regula4ians and further\nskated that all other poCential Toxic fume generators\nbe included or, alternatively, that no toxic fume gen\u2014\nerators be included. The Agency disagrees. According\nto information which the Agency has in its possession\n(see Appendix F), the primary wastes implicated in the\ngeneration of Coxic gas are su?f'_des and cyanides. Thus,\nthe Agency would be remiss if it did not speci_`y these\ntypes of wastes. If others are identified, :hey will\nbe included also.\nB. A number of commenters argued that the test protocols\nproposed in 5ecti.on 250.13 (c)C2) of the regulations were\nexpensive, unreliable and nak specific enough. Additionaliq,\nseveral ocher commenters had problems wiCh specific test\nprotocols. For instance, same commenters argued t~a.t the\n125\u00b0C temperature adopted for the Explosion Tempera~ure Test\nwas not a reasonable temperature and hat decomposi=ion, a~\nused in this test, needs to be defined.)\nAs a result of some preli.ninary cork undertakes 3y k`e\nAgency on khe explosion Temperature 7es~* and after :evie~ n~\n*Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?:acedures aa3 ~arieus\nHazard Ldentification Tests (Final ~eoort)\", NUS C~roora~ion,\nSeptember, 1979, (see Appendix IV).\n\u201418--\n\nthe comments received on these test pTOtgCO~S* (and in ciew of the\ngenetic problems with such tests, discussed above and.iz ~ppen3i~\nIII), the Agency has decided tp remove Lhe test ~rotoco?s from\n\u00a7261.23 of the regulations. The A~encq agrees in general that\ntheq are are unsuitable in defining a \"reactive\" waste ;or RCR~\nregulatory purvoses. T.he A~encY has accordingly zemoved the des-\nignated test protocols from the regulations except to tie extent\nthaC the DepartmenC of Transportation's definiCion of C1ass.A\nexplosives requires use of the shock instability test. As a rzsult\nof this decision, the Agency does not believe it is necessary to\ndiscuss the individual concerns on the various test pro~ocols.\nC. A number of commenters argued that only under land=ill coa-\nditions will a waste be subjected to strong initiating sources\nor heated ander canfinemant. Therefore, they stated [hat since\nno landFillin~ of explosive waste is permitted, these conditions\nwill never occur and Section 25Q.13(c}C1}iii) is unnecessary.\nThis argument is completely circular. If Section 250.13\nCc)(1)(ii) were removed from Che re~ula4ions, exalosive Wastes\nwould not be considered hazardous and c'ould be disposed of in\na sanitary landfill, thus subiectin~ Che castes to the very\nconditions which the commenters contend will cause the waste\nto explode'. In any event, the Agency does not agree that a\nlandfill is the only place in which strong initiating farces\n*Comments were received from [he public on Lhe proposed\nreactivity test protocols both during she 90-dam comment\nperiod on the proposed 53001 re~ulatio~s (43 FR X8956? cad\nin response to the solicitation of con~eats on the NU5 report\n(Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?rocedures and r~rious\nHazard Identification Tests) which was noticed ~n the 'e3era?\nRegister on December 28, 1.979 (44 ~R 76827-76828)\n-19-\n\nor heating under pressure can occur. Pressure increase can\nbe caused by confinement (e.g. , a d-rum) together with\ntemperature increase (e.g. , caused by miming) or gas generation\n(e.g. , desulubilization of gases or deco~posiCion into gases).\nD. A number of commenters advocated exe~ptin~ emergency\nsituations i.e., homemade bombs) from coverage of RCRA so\nthat emergency Ceams can dispose Qf these explosive materials\nas expeditiously as possible without delay (i.e. , without\nrequiring a manifest, etc.) .\nThe regulation already makes acco~~odation for cases of\nimminent hazard in 5263.30. Thus, emergency handling of\nexplosive wastes would be exempted by this section.\nE. Other Comments\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated that all the character-\nistics 'be made as flexible as the reactiviCy character-\nistic.\nThe Agency disagrees with these commenCs; the broad\nmeaning and generic character of the reactivity \"uni-\nverse\" requires a flexible characteristic. The Agency\nwould have preferred Co define reactivity by speC~fic\ntest pro[ocols. However, this is not possible. Thy\nother character~sitics, (except imitable solids) can\nbe delineated o..r gauged by measurzmeat of one Cor a\nfew) specific chemical/physical ~roverties; therefore,\nthe Agency will continue to define the ignitable.\ncorrosive, and toxicity characteristic as proposed.\n-~0-\n\n\u00b0 Ong commenter argued that just because a was~e may\nundergo a violent chemical change with another waste\n~s no reason to consider a waste hazardous. To illu-\nstrate this point, the commenter pointed out tha~ an\nacid and base when mixed will undezgo vio~en~ chemical\nchange, but that such mixing (ne~~~.ralization) is a\nnecessary part of many treatment systems an3 should\nnot be prohibited.\nThe Agency believes this commenter to be under a mis-\napprehension about the scope of the reactivi~y d~\u00a3i-\nnition. The definition of reactivity refers to wastes\nwhich undergo violent change in an uncontrol'ed ~:anner\neither by themselves, or when mixed with water. There-\nfore, the example o~ neutralization given by the commen.~er\nis inanpropria~e, in as much as that example invalves ~~e\nmixing of wastes. Furthermore, tie Agency does ~.o~\nbelieve that the example given Uy the commencer is a fair\nrepresentation of the hazards posed by wastes caoabLe\nof undergoing a violent chemical change. 'Lhe exartple\ngiven involves the controlled interaction he~ween two\nwastes which is a treatment technique and. thLs dies not\nreflect the hazards presented by uncontrolled violent\nchemical change characteristic o\u00a3 waste mana~eme~t\nsituaeions.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the definition. o~ zsactive\nwaste be subdivided into sections which mig:~~ be later\n-21_\n\nindexed into a compatibility chart.\nThe primary purpose of Section 3001 is to identify\nhazardous Wastes, and not to dictate management tech-\npiques. Section 3004 will address the various management\nCechniques including incompatible wastes ~se.e X265.17\nof the regulations). An appendix to the regulations\n(Appendix 5 in Part 265) is provided with just such infor-\nmatron.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency allow a genera -\nfor to use any tesk that is believed appropriate \u00a3or\ndetermining reacCivity. Similarly, one commenter\nsuggested that Appendix III to this background document\nbe removed because it might discourage ase of a su~Cable\ntest.\nThis comment must be evaluated zn Light of the\nAgency's decision not to prescribe any tesCs nor mea-\nsuria~ reactivity. Ordinarilq, when the Agency pre-\nscribes a specific test for measuring a characteristic,\nthe generator is free to employ a different test if he\ncan demonstrate, in accordance with the equivalency\nprocedurees set forth in Subpart E, that his test is\nequivalent to the Agency -prescribed test. 5z~ce Che\nagency has elected not to prescribe any test protocols\nfor measuring reactivity, the question 'of equivivalent\ntest methods is largely mooted: test results are no\nlonger determinative of whether a waste is reac~ive\nand there is nothing against which to measure equivalency.\n\u20142Z'\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the use of tests by\nthe generators is precluded. The generator is \u00a3xee\nto conduct any tests which aid him in assessing whether\nhis waste fits within the prose definition of reactivity.\nHowever, the Agency is not bound in any way by these\ntests and will make its assessment of whether a wasCe\nis reactive by reference to the prose definition.\nIf a generator devises a rest method which he be-\nIieves adequatelq measures the reactivity of a waste, he\nshould submit that Cest method to the Agency nor evalua-\nlion.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the agency address reacti-\nvity over time in the \u2022definition since a material maq\nundergo physical and chemical changes as it ages and\nbecome extremely reactive, whereas it might not be\nreactive when first generated.\nThe Agency agrees with the commenter Chao some\nmaterials, such as certain ethers, can become more re-\nactive with time. However, the Agency has no information\n(such as damage incidents) concerning any wastes which\nmight present this type of preblem. Additionally, khe\nAgency is not aware of any testing method by which such\nwastes might be identified. Therefore, the final regula-\nlion will not address reactivity over time per se; as\nChese wastes are identified by the Agency then mill be\nlisted in Subpart D of Part 261 of the regulations.\n-23-\n\nOne commencer objected to the Agency defining as reactive\nthose wastes which are capable of detonation or explosive\nreaction i\u00a3 subjected to a strong initiating source or\nheated under confinement. The commenter asserted that\nmany inert, non-reactive materials, including Cap Water,\ncan be triggered to detonate or explode under confinement\nwhen subjected to strong, heat, pressure, or a combinaCion\nof these and other initiating sources.\nThe Agencq disagrees with this commenter and rakes\nspecific issue with Che assertion thzt mane relatively\ninert substances could be made to explode when subjec^\nted to extreme heat and pressure. Ia any event, even\nif relatively inert substances could be made to explode\nwhen subjected to str~ttg heat and pressure, these sub-\n.stances would noC be considered reactive under the pro-\nposed definition. The Ageney is only concerned with\nsubstances capable of exploding under reasonable confine-\nwent conditions -- i.e., those confiae~ent conditions\nlikely to be encountered in disposal environments.\nV; Promulgated Regulations\nAs a result of EPA's review of the conaents regarding\nthe rea'ctivi'ty characteristic, EPA is promuL~ating a reactivity\ncharacteristic which significantly differs `rim ~~e proposed\nzegulations in two aspects: the thermal instability and shock\ninstability Cest protocols cited in the pro?osed regulation\nhas been removed and the section relaCive to generation o\u00a3\ntoxic gas, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sul`ide has been\n-24-\n\nmade amore svecific. The thermal instability test proCocoL\nwas removed becaase the Agency determined that its interpre-\ntation was too subiective for use in a regulators program*.\n(See Appendix IV),\n\u00a7261.23 Characteristic of reactivity ! ! ~. ,\n1 r ~\n(a) A solid waste exhibits the characteristic of react~ivit 'y\nif a representative sample of the waste has any of the foliowin~\nproperties:\n~1) 'Lt is normally unstable and readzly undergoes violent\nchange without detonating.\n(2) It reacts violently with water.\n(3) It Forms potentially explosive mixtures with water.\n(4) When mixed with water, it generates toxic bases, vapors\nor fumes in a quantity sufficient to present dax~t~er to\nhuman health or the environment.\nC5) It is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which, when ex-\nposed to conditions of pH between 2 and 12.5, can ~en-e\nerate toxic uses, vapors or fumes in a quanCity suffi-\ncient to present dander to human health or the environ-\nment.\n(6) It is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if sub'\njetted Co a strong initiating source or if heated under\nconfinement.\n(7) It is readily capable of detonation or explosive decotnvo-\nsition or reaction at sCandard temverature and pressure.\n*\"Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?rocedure and Various\nAazard Identification Tests\", t~'inal Revort) ~ NUS Corvoration,\nSeptember, 1979, (Appendix IV)\n-25-\n\n(8) It is a forbidden explosive as de`ined in 49 CFR 173.51\nor a Class A explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.53,. or\na Class B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.88.\n(b) A solid waste that exhibzts the characteristic of\nreactivity, but is not listed as a hazardous waste in Subpa_t\nD, has the EPA Hazardous Waste Number D003.\n-26-\n\nATTACHMENT 25\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nMAY 19 1997\nOFFICE OF\nSOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY\nRESPONSE\nT.L. Nebrich, Jr.\nTechnical Director\nWaste Technology Services, Inc.\n640 Park Place,\nNiagra Falls, New York, 14301\nDear Mr. Nebrich:\nThank you for your letter of March 5, 1997 in which you request a clarification of\nthe definition of the characteristic of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6) as it pertains to\naerosol cans.\nOver the past several years we have received numerous questions concerning the\nregulatory status of used aerosol cans under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. We are not at this time able to make a\ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a\nwide range of products exhibit the characteristic of reactivity. It remains the\nresponsibility of the generator of any particular waste to make this determination (see\n40 CFR 262.11). However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount\nof liquid (e.g., a can that has been punctured and drained) would meet the definition of\nscrap metal (40 CFR 261.1(c)(6)), and, if it is to be recycled, would be exempt from\nregulation under 40 CFR 261.6 (a)(3)(iv). Scrap metal that is recycled is exempt from\nRCRA regulation under this provision even if it is hazardous waste, so generators need\nnot make a hazardous waste determination. Scrap metal that is not recycled, however,\nis subject to the hazardous waste regulations if it is hazardous, so generators must make\na hazardous waste determination.\nI hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions,\nplease call Anna Tschursin of my staff at (703) 308-8805.\nSincerely yours,\nElizabeth A.

Bergeson\nWeinberg, Sergeson, and Neuman\n1300 Eye Street, N.W.\nSuite 1000 West\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nDear Ms. Bergeson:\nThank you for your letter of October 14, 1994 requesting clarification of the regulatory\nrequirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) applicable to the collection,\ntransportation and recycling of spent antifreeze generated at automobile service centers, in particular, at\nwhat point spent antifreeze becomes a solid waste.\nThis request was posed in order in the context of a spent antifreeze recycling program, wherein\nspent antifreeze generated from radiator flushes done at automobile service centers (specifically,\nValvoline Instant Oil Change stores) is collected, stored and sent for recycling at Union Carbide's\nGlycol Recovery Unit in Institute, West Virginia. The specific questions you raised relate to the\npractical difficulties of generating and characterizing spent antifreeze, where one radiator flush may be\nhazardous and the next flush nonhazardous. Please forgive the delay in responding to your request.\nThe following discussion of the RCRA regulations applicable to the spent antifreeze recycling\nprogram that your clients, Union Carbide Corporation and Ecogard, Inc., plan to establish comes after\ncareful consideration of this recycling program and extensive phone conversations between Tom\nOvenden and my staff.\nAt this time, EPA has not determined what point of generation will be applied to \"like wastes\"\n(wastes of a similar composition) through any future Agency rulemakings. As you know, the Agency\nhas solicited comment in its Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) Phase III proposed rule on different\noptions to designating the point of generation for like-wastes. See 60 FR 11702, 11715-11717\n(March 2, 1995). The three specific options presented in the preamble would view the collection of\nmany streams as a single waste for purposes of identifying a point of generation.\nFaxBack # 14003\n\nAs an alternative to designating a point of collection of many streams, the Agency could\nestablish a point of generation for like-wastes upstream of the collection point of like-wastes (e.g., an\nautomotive radiator in the case of spent anti-freeze). However, at least with respect to anti-freeze, we\nare not certain that this represents the most practical way to approach antifreeze management when\nanti-freeze is routinely aggregated and collected in drums and tanks and the characteristic of the\nantifreeze in those containers is the best indicator of potential environmental risks if the material were\nreleased to the environment.\nGiven the facts of the situation, we also realize that it would be impractical to require each\nindividual radiator flush to be tested for a hazardous characteristic. We also realize that assuming that\neach radiator flush is characteristically hazardous may limit the volume of spent antifreeze that\nautomobile service centers will store and this make available for recycling and, ultimately, may impact on\nthe cost-effectiveness of the overall spent antifreeze recycling program.\nBearing this in mind, even if the Agency were to determine that the point of generation should be\nat the radiator, we believe that it would be appropriate for a generator to rely on \"knowledge\" of the\nwaste (as per 40 CFR 262.11(c) (2)) based on studies done to characterize the frequency of\n\"hazardous\" spent antifreeze generated (relative to the generation of \"nonhazardous\" spent arrtifreeze), in\norder to characterize the total volume of hazardous waste generated. Study data. may also be used to\ncharacterize the consolidated volume of spent antifreeze. As you cite in your letter, data. collected by\nvarious parties indicate that up to 40 % of the spent antifreeze flushed from radiators may be hazardous,\nprimarily due to lead. Thus, the Agency believes that, absent facility-specific data. to the contrary, it\nwould be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total consolidated volume of\nspent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60%nonhazardous. Note, however, that\nfacility-specific data. gathered by spent antifreeze generators or authorized regulating agencies could\noverride this 40% presumption and show higher or lower percentages of hazardous wastes.\nThis use of \"knowledge\" of the wastestreams, as applied to the total volume of spent antifreeze\ngenerated, would be an appropriate alternative to testing the spent antifreeze. And, just to clarify, this\napproach would be appropriate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the\npurposes of being eligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators.\nWe agree with you that commingling \"40% hazardous\" spent antifreeze with \"60%\nnonhazardous\" spent antifreeze in a common tank or container by the generator prior to the recycling of\nthe spent antifreeze (and the subsequent treatment and disposal of the residues from recycling in\ncompliance with Part 268) would not constitute impermissible dilution under 40 CFR 2683. Given that\nthis mixing would be done to facilitate proper treatment \u2014recycling and subsequent treatment which\ndestroys, removes or immobilizes hazardous constituents before land disposal \u2014the dilution would not\nbe impermissible.\nIn response to your inquiries regarding the application of the dilution prohibition to the burning of\nmetal-bearing wastes and the burning of the still bottom residues of the spent antifreeze recycling\nprocess, the Agency would consider the still bottoms to be newly generated wastes. Assuming that the\n\nstill bottoms were hazardous, they could appropriately be burned for energy recovery in a regulated unit\nprovided that they have sufficient BTU value. Therefore, the Agency would not consider the burning of\nthe metal-bearing/high BTU bottoms to be impermissible dilution.\nAs for your inquiries regarding the applicable notifications and certifications for the purposes of\nthe land disposal restrictions, insofar as the generator mixes hazardous and nonhazardous spent\nantifreeze such that the resultant mixture is no longer hazardous and meets the applicable treatment\nstandards, the generator must comply with the notification and certification requirements of section\n268.9.\nIn summary, 'the Agency were to determine the radiator to be the point of generation for spent\nanti-freeze, we believe that one possible scenario for the spent antifreeze program is where an\nautomobile service center could commingle each individual radiator flush in a tank or container,\nassuming (absent facility-specific data. to the contrary) for the purposes of waste characterization and\nquantity of hazardous waste generated that 40% of the total volume generated in a month is hazardous\n(D008). The generator could also consider the accumulated total volume of spent antifreeze to be\nnonhazardous.\nThe generator would comply with the one-time notification and certification requirements of\nsection 268.9(d). And, because the commingled mixture of the spent antifreeze is no longer hazardous,\nno hazardous waste manifest would be required.\nThe recycler receiving the nonhazardous spent antifreeze would not require a hazardous waste\nstorage permit or be subject to other hazardous waste management requirements for this wastestream.\nThe recycler should characterize any residues from the distillation/recycling of spent anti freeze\nto determine if they are hazardous wastes. If any of the residuals are hazardous, the recycler must\ncomply with the applicable land disposal restrictions requirements of Part 268 (e.g., notification and\ncertification).\nAssuming, as discussed in your letter, that the residues are hazardous metal-bearing/high BTU\nwastes, these residues may be transported (with a hazardous waste manifest, and land disposal\nrestrictions notification) to a permitted hazardous waste combustion unit for treatment. The final\ntreatment facility would certify compliance with the applicable treatment standards prior to disposal of\nthe residues. You should note, however, that this would be pursuant to the Federal regulatory program.\nAs you know, States that are authorized for RCRA program may have more stringent requirements.\n\nThank you for your interest in the development of a recycling program to manage a common,\nand somewhat problematic, wastestream in an environmentally sound manner.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\n\nATTACHMENT 27\n\nStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA's Regulatory Framework\nSeptember 12, 2016\nI. Introduction\nA. Background\nRegulation of hazardous waste generated by the retail sector under the federal Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act (RCRA) presents unique challenges that are not found in more \"traditional\" RCRA- regulated\nindustries. The retail sector as a whole handles a very large number of diverse products', which change over time\nand may, in many instances, become regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA when discarded 2. As a result,\nretailers are required to make hazardous waste deternvnations for a variety of products at stores located across the\ncountry.\nAdditionally, the reverse distribution 3 process where retail stores generally send unused goods to reverse logistics\ncenters and rely upon arrangements with suppliers/vendors 4 to determine the ultimate disposition of these goods is\nawell-established business practice in the retail sector. Nevertheless, how the reverse distrbution processes is\nregulated, or should be regulated, under RCRA has resulted in a number of questions from both retailers and\nregulators. This issue becomes more complicated for retail chains with store locations in many different states,\nwhere states have taken various positions on how RCRA regulations apply.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) began a review of how RCRA hazardous\nwaste regulations apply to the retail sector in order to better understand challenges in complying with RCRA\nregulations. EPA's review consisted of discussions with various members of the retail community and states\nthrough meetings, conferences and site visits.\nOn January 11, 2011, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO)13563 regarding the retrospective review of\nregulations, which required federal agencies such as EPA to develop a plan to \"...determine whether any such\nregulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's regulatory\nprogram more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.\"\nEPA published a Notice of Data Availability (NODA) for the Retail Sector, dated February 14, 2014 (79 FR\n8926) as part of the Agency's continuing efforts to better understand concerns from all stakeholders regarding\nRCRA's applicability to the retail sector, as well as to obtain information and feedback on issues affecting the\nretail sector. The NODA was also intended to satisfy EPA's corrunitment under this EO to solicit public comment\non issues associated with the retail sector. Additional information regarding the NODA is presented in Section\nII.A.\n1 Although the terms \"products\"and\"goods\" are used and generally described at times as \"items\"or \"materials\" in this document, use of\nthese terms is not intended to indicate if or when such items/materials become wastes either at the store or during the reverse distribution\nprocess.\n2 The term discarded is defined at 40 CFR 261.2(a)(2). When a material, such as a retail item, is discarded is a key question because, once\na decision to discard is made, the material becomes a solid waste and the person making this decision is a generator of solid waste. At\nsuch point and time, the generator would be required to make a hazardous waste determination.\n3 EPA is aware that the term \"reverse distribution\" is often used for pharmaceuticals, whereas \"reverse logistics\" is used for non-\npharmaceuticals); however, the former term appears throughout this document and is intended to apply to all retail items under this\nprocess.\n^ The terms \"supplier\"and \"vendor\" (latter more commonly used in the retail industry) appearmore often in this document, as compared\nto\"manufacturer,\" since it is more likely the flow ofgoods/products occurs between retailers and suppliers/vendors (or agents thereof,\nalthough suppliers themselves may also be manufacturers or product formulators.\n\nEPA's ongoing outreach efforts, combined with the comments received on the NODA, have improved the\nAgency's understanding of the challenges arising when managing unused/intact consumer goods that have\nbecome unsalable at retail stores and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\nB. Objective\nEPA's considerable engagement with the retail sector and regulators to date has resulted in development of this\nstrategy, which lays out a cohesive plan to address the unique challenges faced by the retail sector in complying\nwith RCRA regulations while reducing burden and protecting human health and the environment.\nIn crafting this strategy, EPA recognizes that RCRA regulations, which were developed primarily for\nmanufacturing settings, are not necessarily the best fit for the retail sector. EPA is also aware that the Agency has,\nin the past, made efforts to tailor RCRA regulations to address certain types of unique waste management\ncircumstances (e.g., used oil, universal wastes, spent lead-acid batteries, academic laboratory waste).\nEPA further recognizes that there are occasions when unused/inta.ct consumer goods, including customer returns,\ncannot be sold by the original retailer for a variety of reasons such as mandatory or voluntary recalls, seasonal\nchanges, overstock and expired shelf-life.\nFinally, the Agency is taking into account retail sector practices already in place, such as the reverse distrbution\nprocess, to promote sustainability by ensuring that retail items remain marketable as commodities for donation or\nliquidations, thus reducing the amount of waste generated and encouraging recycling of wastes that are generated,\nas opposed to being disposed as solid or hazardous waste. b\nWith this in mind, our strategy consists of athree-pronged approach, which is further discussed in Sections III and\nIV of this document:\n1. Issue Agency policy, guidance and rulemaking to ensure a better fit between RCRA regulations and the retail\nsector.\n2. Research retail hazardous waste management practices and related issues in the area of reverse distrbution,\nuniversal waste and other challenges.\n3. Using the results of our evaluation and research, identify additional approaches to address outstanding RCRA\nretail sector issues if needed.\nII. Identification ofRetail Sector Issues\nA. Retail NODA\nThe objectives of the 2014 Retail NODA were to share information EPA had collected and, more importantly, to\nobtain additional information that would allow the Agency to better understand and address issues encountered by\nindustry and regulators with respect to the application of RCRA regulations, guidance and policy to the retail\nsector.\nIn the NODA, EPA requested comment on a series of topics related to retail operations, waste management\npractices and management of materials that may become hazardous waste when discarded. This specifically\nincluded requests for information regarding aerosol cans (e.g., quantity generated, classification and management\n5 The term \"liquidation\" (also known as salvage) is used in this document to describe sale of products on the secondary market for use by\nconsumers.\nRoutine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials, as well as the occurrence of damaged/leaking products no longer\nconsidered commodities and \"unknowns\"(item contents cannot be identified), also result in waste generation.\n2\n\noptions, including handling as universal waste), since aerosol cans comprise a large percentage of the retail\nsector's hazardous waste stream. The NODA comment period closed on May 30, 2014.\nEPA received comments from 44 stakeholders, with comments consisting of feedback from: (1) companies\nconsisting primarily of retailers [nine commenters]; (2) industry/trade Associations [nine commenters]; (3)\ngovernment and related organizations [seven commenters]; (4) recyclers [three commenters]; (5) waste\nmanagement and treatment, storage and disposal facilities [three commenters]; (6) law firms [three commenters];\n(7) reverse logistics provider [one commenter] and (8) anonymous [nine commenters]. The NODA and supporting\ndocuments, along with comments on the NODA, are available at http://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-\nwaste-management-and-reta il-sector.\nB. Summary of Comments on Retail NODA\nAs part of developing this strategy, EPA has reviewed all NODA comments to identify stakeholder\nissues/concerns, including suggestions on how to better address the retail sector under RCRA. Feedback from\nNODA commenters reinforced EPA's understanding that the retail sector differs from the\nindustriaUmanufacturing sector in the following key respects:\n\u2022 Large number of stores in many locations handling consumer goods that, in many situations, could become\nhazardous waste upon discard\n\u2022 Numerous varieties of goods, which are generally manufactured by someone else and whose ingredients are\noften not fully known, make hazardous waste determinations difficult\n\u2022 Unpredictable quantity of waste generation due to episodic generation (e.g., recalls and customer returns)\n\u2022 Hazardous waste training at the store level is difficult due to high employee turnover\n\u2022 Use of the reverse distribution process to manage unsalable products \u2014including those that become hazardous\nwaste when discarded\nEPA gouped suggestions from NODA commenters into the following major categories (approximate percentage\nof commenters suggesting a particular approach is shown in parentheses)':\n\u2022 Address Pharmaceuticals (42%)\no Remove P-listing for nicotine -containing products (23%)\no Manage as Universal Wastes (17%)\n\u2022 Endorse Reverse Distribution Retail Paradigm \u2014encompasses point of generation and waste determination\nissues (40%)\no Exclude Retail Goods Managed under the Reverse Distribution Process from the Definition of Solid\nWaste (15%)\nExpand Universal Waste Regulations to Other Waste Categories\no Aerosol Cans (35%)\no Pesticides (19%)\no Electronics (17%)\no All Retail GoodsB (14%)\n\u2022 Provide Flexibility for Episodic Generation and Hazardous Waste Quantity Determinations (19%)\n\u2022 Exclude Retail Goods as Household Hazardous Waste/Expand \"Household Hazardous Waste\" Exemption\n(10%)\n\u2022 Revise and Update Satellite Accumulation Area Requirements (9%)\nEPA identified the following additional NODA commenter suggestions that did not fall into major categories:\n~ Universal waste percentages include instances where certain items (pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics) were\nidentified individually and where retail goods as a whole were mentioned.\n8 Assumed to include, but would not necessarily be limited to, pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics.\n\n\u2022 Determine the actual extent of the retail sector \"universe\" in terms of the numbers of retailers, types of retail\nitems handled and amount of wastes generated, as well accurately designating generator categories (i.e., la.rge\nquantity, small quantity and conditionally exempt small quantity generators).\n\u2022 Coordinate with other federal agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation and Food and Drug\nAdministration) when issuing guidance/policy or developing regulations that may affect management of\nmaterials/wastes in the retail sector in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts or duplication of effort.\n\u2022 Clarify the Agency's position regarding whether aerosol cans are considered a reactive hazardous waste.\nConduct outreach activities such as identifying/providing opportunities for training and offering compliance\nassistance.\n\u2022 Support use of e-Manifest and other electronic means of documenting compliance with RCRA regulations.\n\u2022 Recog~vze challenges associated with waste management under differing state regulations.\n\u2022 Eliminate the requirement for large quantity generators to store ignitable or reactive waste at least fifty feet\nfrom the facility's properly line.\nTo the extent they are not already being addressed through policy, guidance and rulemaking or other EPA actions,\nthe Agency will consider the aforementioned issues as part of implementing this strategy.\nIII. Response to Household Hazardous Waste Exemption NODA Comments\nSome NODA commenters suggested that EPA expand the \"household hazardous waste\" exclusion at 40 CFR\n261.4(b)(1) to include either retail goods as a whole or certain types of retail goods. The Agency has already\naddressed this issue as part of a previous rulemaking that responded, in part, to a petition from the American\nRetail Federation (ARF).\nAs explained in a final November 13, 1984 rule (49 FR 44978), EPA excluded household hazardous waste\nbecause the legislative history of RCRA indicated an intent to exclude such wastes and not because these wastes\ncan never pose the risks associated with hazardous wastes. Additionally, consistent with legislative history, EPA\ndetermined that it was necessary to establish two criteria that must be met to qualify for this exclusion when\nevaluating ARF's petition. First, the waste must be generated by individuals on the premises of a temporary or\npermanent residence and, second, the waste stream must be composed primarily of materials found in wastes\ngenerated by consumers in their homes. In this final rule, EPA denied ARF's petition to exempt consumer\nhousehold products from retail sources because these wastes fail to meet both criteria. EPA continues to believe\nthat retail goods, including those that could become wastes when discarded, do not satisfy the criteria for this\nexclusion.\nIV. Current EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nPrior to issuing the NODA in 2014, EPA had already begun developing the Pharmaceuticals rule (staring in 2009)\nand the Generator Improvements rule (starting in 2011), as well as the Definition of Solid Waste (DSW) rule.\nBecause pharmaceutical hazardous waste is a large part of the retail sector's RCRA concerns, EPA mentioned in\nthe NODA that the Agency was developing a proposed rule for healthcare facility-specific management standards\nfor hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (the Pharmaceuticals rule).\nAlthough, for the most part, it was not possible to address all the feedback received on the NODA in these\nrulemakings, EPA has tried to incorporate approaches in these rulemakings to address some of the NODA\ncomments in order to ease the burden of managing hazardous wastes in a retail setting. A discussion of these\nefforts is provided below:\nA. DSW Rule\nThe final DSW rule, dated January 13, 2015 (80 FR 1694), provides new conditional exclusions for hazardous\nsecondary materials. If these materials are managed according to specified conditions, legitimately recycled and\nsent to a verified recycler, they would not be regulated as a solid waste. Retailers may be able to use tivs\n4\n\nexclusion for recycling aerosol cans and possibly other retail items. Additional information on this final\nrulemaking is available at httpJ/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/final-rule-201.5-definition-solid-waste-dsw.\nEPA is coordinating with stakeholders and conducting outreach activities in order to implement and monitor\neffectiveness ofthe final DSW rule.\nB. Ge ne rator Improve ments Rule\nThe proposed Generator Improvements rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 57018), advances approaches for\naddressing a number of issues facing the hazardous waste generator community, including the following issues\nrelevant to the retail sector:\n\u2022 Provides flexibility for episodic generators of hazardous waste.\n\u2022 Allows consolidation of conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste at large quantity generators.\n\u2022 Permits waiver of the 50-foot buffer requirement for ignitable/reactive wastes under certain conditions.\nEPA plans to finalize this rule in fall 2016. Additional information on this rule is available at\nhttpl/www. epa. gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-hazardous-waste-generator-improvements.\nC. Pharmaceuticals Rule\nThe proposed Pharmaceuticals rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 58014), addresses a number of retailer\nRCRA concerns. The proposed rule:\n\u2022 Advances an approach so that a healthcare facility, including a retailer with a pharmacy, who generates 1 kg\nof acute P-listed hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a calendar month will not become the most stringently\nregulated generator (a large quantity generator).\n\u2022 Sets forth a tailored set of management standards specifically designed to reduce the complexity and\nregulatory burden of the RCRA hazardous waste regulations for the management of hazardous waste\npharmaceuticals by health care facilities, including hospitals, clinics and retail stores with pharmacies.\n\u2022 Provides regulatory clarity on how the reverse distrbution of pharmaceuticals is regulated under RCRA.\n\u2022 Explores two possible approaches in the rule to address concerns with designating nicotine -containing\nsmoking cessation products (e.g., gums, lozenges and patches) and other low-concentration nicotine-\ncontaining products as acutely hazardous (P-listed) wastes. For both approaches, EPA requested toacicity data.\nfor nicotine (P075). The two regulatory options are: (1) a narrow exemption from the P075 listing for Food\nand Drug Administration -approved over-the-counter smoking cessation products (patches, gums, and\nlozenges) and (2) broader, concentration -based approach to listing nicotine (P-listing for high concentrations\nand U-listing for low concentrations, similar to the approach taken for warfarin.\n\u2022 Requests comment in the rule preamble on whether e-cigarettes and nicotine -containing liquids for e-\ncigarettes should be included within the scope of the definition of pharmaceutical and therefore managed as\nother hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceuticals rule.\nAdditional information on this rule is available at httpl/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-management-\nstandards-hazy rdous-waste-pharmaceuticals.\nBeyond the pharmaceuticals proposed rule, EPA has issued guidance to provide regulatory clarity regarding the\nfollowing issues:\n5\n\n\u2022 In letters dated May 8, 2015, EPA issued separate guidance clarifying that: (1) e-cigarettes are P075 waste\ndue to the attached cartridges of nicotine (RCRA Online 14850) and (2) nicotine patches, gums, lozenges and\ne-cigarettes are not solid or hazardous waste when sent for nicotine reclamation (RCRA Online 14851).\n\u2022 In a letter dated October 2, 2015, EPA also issued guidance clarifying that pharmaceutical controlled\nsubstances from households can be accepted at Drug Enforcement Agency -authorized collection receptacles,\nincluding those established at retail stores with pharmacies (RCRA Online 14853).\nV. Upcoming EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nEPA is currently focusing the Agency's near-term efforts on finalizing the Pharmaceuticals and Generator\nImprovements rules. However, we will be undertaking a number of upcoming activities that will also address the\nRCRA concerns of the retail sector and other stakeholders.\nPrimarily, these activities include issuing a guide to recycling aerosol cans, proposing to add aerosol cans to the\nfederal universal waste rules, and developing a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail\nsector as a whole.\nTo date, EPA has gathered useful information regarding management of consumer goods in the retail sector and\nthe associated issues encountered during this process. The Agency's strategy calls for continued engagement\nwith the retail sector and other stakeholders, such as industry representatives and state/tribaUlocal governments, to\nsupport our efforts in moving forward to address the reverse distribution process and universal waste\nmanagement. As necessary, in order to inform future EPA decisions, this outreach/coordination process is\nexpected to involve attending meetings/conferences, conducting site visits and participating in work groups.\nUpcoming activities are discussed in more detail below.\nA. Guide to Recycling Aerosol Cans\nEPA is developing a guide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subtitle C recycling exclusions,\nincluding recyling aerosol cans for scrap metal recovery. EPA anticipates that this guide will assist generators of\naerosol cans and recyclers to increase their recycling of this ubiquitous waste stream.\nB. Role ofUniversal Waste Regulations\nEPA has been exploring the potential for adding certain retail items, such as aerosol cans, pesticides, and/or\nelectronics, to the federal universal waste regulations by conducting the following activities:\n\u2022 Obtain additional information regarding state programs currently in place to manage aerosol cans (e.g.,\nCalifornia and Colorado) and electronics (e.g., Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana,\nMichigan, Nebraska and New Jersey) as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Identify and consult with states that are considering including aerosol cans, electronics or other types of items\nas categories of universal waste.\n\u2022 Determine the extent to which states regulate other retail items, including pesticides beyond those recalled, as\nin suspended or cancelled, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Evaluate information received from states, including any advantages/disadvantages and challenges associated\nwith management of retail items as universal wastes.\n9 Additional information regarding EPA's key observations and particular examples of stakeholder outreach efforts to date is provided in\nthe Appendixto this strategy.\nG~\n\nIn addition to aforementioned, EPA considers a number of factors, as set forth in federal RCRA regulations, when\ndetermining whether a hazardous waste or category of hazardous waste should be included as universal wastes.'o\nTaking into account feedback from NODA commenters and other information obtained to date, EPA believes that\naerosol cans are 1~7cely to be good candidates for management under federal universal waste regulations.\nTherefore, the Agency is moving forward with plans to develop a proposed rule to address aerosol cans as\nuniversal waste.\nC. Policy on Reverse Distribution and RCRA\nEPA recognizes that, although there are areas within the program that work well, RCRA regulations may not\nalways be the best frt for the retail sector. This has come to light in terms of the reverse distribution process used\nin the retail sector, particular as relates to when discard occurs or is intended to occur and the timing of waste\ndeterminations.\nTherefore, EPA intends to develop a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail sector as a\nwhole. In doing so, EPA is working from the Agency's understanding regarding the \"flow\" of consumer goods\namong different entities, as well as the roles/relationships of retailers, suppliers/vendors, reverse logistics centers\nand others with respect to unused intact consumer goods that have become unsalable at retail stores for a variety\nof reasons and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\" Unsalable retail items include excess\ninventory, such as expired or outdated items, seasonal items, overstock, recalled (volunta.ry or involuntary)\nproducts and returned items.\nIn developing this policy, EPA will take into account key observations made to date (see appendix), with a\nparticular focus on the nature/extent and significance of challenges encountered when managing consumer goods\nin the retail sector, by considering the following issues:\n\u2022 Scope of the retail \"universe,\" including the number of individually- or family-owned stores\n\u2022 Positions of regulators such as EPA regions, states/tribes and, as necessary, local governments on the location\nof the point of generation\n\u2022 Extent to which inspections by regulators continue to identify compliance issues in the retail sector, including\nfailure to make hazardous waste determinations\n\u2022 Extent to which the reverse distribution process results in appropriate management of unsalable consumer\ngoods originating from retail stores, such that the percentage of retail items disposed as solid or hazardous\nwaste is reduced to the maximum eactent possible\nThis policy is not intended to address wastes from routine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials,\nas well as damaged/leaking products no longer considered commodities and \"unknowns\" (item contents cannot be\nidentified).\nContact: Questions regarding this strategy should be directed to Drew Launch at lausch.robert@epa.gov or 703-\n603-0721 or Kristin Fitzgerald at fitzgerald.kristin@epa.gov or 703-308-8286.\n10 These factors are discussed at 40 CFR 273.81.\n~ ~ A diagam showing the flow of retail items and relationships among various organizations that manage consumer goods and wastes is\navailable at http://www.epagov/hwgenerators/strategy-addressing-retail-sector-under-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act.\n7\n\nAPPENDIX\nKey Observations to Date\nAs part of developing this strategy, the Agency has been conducting outreach efforts (meetings, conferences, site\nvisits, etc.) with key stakeholders and, based on these efforts, the following is noted in no particular order of\nimportance:\n\u2022 When and where hazardous waste determinations are made (i.e., at the store versus at a reverse logistics\ncenter) varies from retailer to retailer and from product to product \u2014and may also vary with time.\n\u2022 Positions of regulators on the location of the point of generation (when a product becomes a waste) vary and\ninspections of retail stores have identified compliance issues \u2014and inspections are anticipated to occur in the\nfuture.\n\u2022 Certain retail chains use safety data sheet-based scanning systems keyed to universal product codes (UPCs) or\nstock keeping units (SKUs) to assist in making waste determinations at the store; however, smaller retailers\nand individually- or family-owned stores may lack this capability and/or may not be fully aware of RCRA\nobligations.\n\u2022 Information regarding the chemical content of certain manufacturers' products is sometimes made publicly\navailable or, if it is considered confidential business information, may be selectively shared with others in\norder to inform appropriate end-of-life management.\n\u2022 There e~sts software that relies upon proprietary manufacturers' product information to determine\nappropriate disposition of unsalable retail items, although how widely this software is utilized across the retail\nsector is not fully known.\n\u2022 Retailers are using third parties to ensure proper management of products determined to be hazardous waste at\nstore locations, although the extent to which this occurs across the retail sector is uncertain.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers also use an SDS-based UPC/SKU scanning system, although the extent to which\nreverse logistics centers as a whole are taking this approach is uncertain.\n\u2022 Waste determinations typically occur at the reverse logistics centers for some retail goods when it's clear that\nthese items have a high possibility of being donated, liquidated or otherwise recycled.\n\u2022 Certain non-prescription drugs (e.g., hand sanitizers, multi-symptom cold relievers and sore throat medicines)\nand supplements such as vitamins are sent to reverse logistics centers where they are disposed as hazardous\nwaste if, for example, the expiration date has passed.\n\u2022 Protocols or corporate directives are in place that specify how retail stores, reverse logistics centers and\nsuppliers/vendors handle excess inventory, make hazardous waste determinations and decide the ultimate\ndisposition of products, ahhough this seems less l~cely in the case of individually- or family-owned stores.\n\u2022 Contracts or other written agreements exist between a retailer and supplier/vendor that specify how the\nprocess for returning unsalable items and awarding of credit works, as well as the extent to which particular\nproducts are required to be managed a certain way, such as prohibiting donation/Gquidation and requiring\ndisposal as hazardous waste due to \"branding issues\" or other concerns.lz\n1z Since EPA is aware that a large percentage of unsalable retail items are \"returned to the supplier/vendor,\" the ultimate disposition of\nthese items is of interest to the Agency.\n8\n\n\u2022 Credit is provided to retailers for unsalable consumer goods, which have an inherent value in that they remain\npotentially marketable as commodities that could be donated or liquidated, which serves as incentive for\nproper management until such time credit is received. 13\n\u2022 Retailers may also be assuming increased responsibility for management and ultimate disposition of unsalable\nretail items as part of the \"Adjustable Rate Policy\" process (supplier/vendor or agent not involved). `a\n\u2022 Given past experiences or other information, such as agreements between suppliers/vendors and\nretailers, retailers may know beforehand that certain consumer goods will ultimately be disposed as hazardous\nwaste, including products that are returned to ensure receipt of manufacturer/supplier credit.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers play a key role in the management of consumer goods, performing functions such as\ndata collection, financial reconciliation such as credit verification, recall management, material tracking and\nmaterial disposition (i.e., reuse, recycling or disposal).\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers may also offer benefits such as increasing the likelihood that consumer goods may\nbe donated or liquidated, due to economies of scale, and ensuring that hazardous waste determinations are\nproperly performed.\n\u2022 The role played by suppliers/vendors in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition, is critical and\nrepresents an area requiring further study.\n\u2022 Suppliers/vendors play a critical role in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition.\n\u2022 Retail items may be repaired/refurbished for ultimate use by consumers but how often and by whom is\nuncertain.\nCertain unsalable retail items may be returned to the manufacturer for use in preparing products (i.e., blended\ninto existing formulations), although the extent to which this occurs is unknown.\n\u2022 Feedback from state programs thus far indicates that management of items such as aerosol cans and\nelectronics as universal wastes works well.\n\u2022 Recycling of aerosol can propellant for use as fuel and the actual container as scrap metal, appear more\ncommon than recycling of can contents (product).\n13 It does not necessarily follow that these items will ultimately be donated or liquidated since they may become a waste in cases where a\nsupplier/vendor requires disposal or where a reverse logistics center determines that disposal is the only remaining management option.\nla Additional information on the Adjustable Rate Policy and other reimbursement policies for unsalable items can be found in the\npublication entitled, 2008 Joint Industry Unsaleables Management Study: The Real Causes and Actionable Solutions. This publication\nis available at http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/CJnsaleablesFINAL091108.pdf.\n0\n\nStakeholder Outreach Efforts\nSince the close of the NODA comment period, EPA has been reaching out to various stakeholders and engaging\nin discussions in order to learn more about challenges associated with RCRA and the retail sector. Some examples\ninclude:\n\u2022 EPA participated in the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RICA) conference during September 29-October\n2, 2014 in Minneapolis, MN, which accorded an opportunity to network with various industry representatives\nregarding the Retail NODA and the Agency's retail initiative.\n\u2022 EPA provided an update regarding the Retail NODA at the annual meeting of the Association of State and\nTerritorial Solid Waste Management Officials on October 30, 2014 in Reston, VA.\n\u2022 On November 20, 2014, EPA met with the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) to learn more about\nWFCA's industry/membership and discuss the Retail NODA and better understand the relevance of Agency's\nretail initiative and retail strategy development on products manufactured by WFCA members.\n\u2022 On January 7, 2015, EPA provided regulatory updates to regions and states including a discussion regarding\nthe status of the Pharmaceuticals Rule, Generator Improvement Rule and Defirrition of Solid Waste Rule, as\nwell as efforts associated with the retail initiative and retail strategy development.\n\u2022 On January 14, 2015, EPA participated in a regulatory roundtable as part of the Council on Safe\nTransportation of Hazardous Articles Quarterly Membership meeting in Arlington, VA. Discussions involved\nRetail NODA comments and development of a strategy to address retailer concerns.\n\u2022 EPA gave a presentation on the Retail NODA and development of a retail strategy as part of the RICA\nconference on February 10~'' in Atlanta, GA and Pesticide Stewardship Alliance conference on February 1 ltn\nin Savannah, GA.\n\u2022 During February 23-26, 2015, the Agency participated in a series of meetings and visits involving EPA\nRegion 9, various levels of government in the State of California. (Attorney General's Office, Cal EPA, local\nDistrict Attorney Offices and counties), and industry representatives. This included tours of an electronics\nwaste facility, retail stores (CVS, COSTCO and Cowes) and a reverse logistics center (Inmar Incorporated).\n\u2022 During March 16-19, 2015, in support of implementing the EPA's Retail Sector Strategy, the Agency\nattended the Store Planning, Equipment, Construction and Facilities Services 2015 Annual Conference in Las\nVegas, NV \u2014where the Agency gave a presentation on RCRA and the retail strategy and sustainability\nmanagement \u2014 toured a Walmart store and return center, and met with the State of Nevada's Division of\nEnvironmental Protection.\n\u2022 On April 13, 2015, EPA participated in a Retail Waste Workgroup meeting sponsored by the California\nDepartment of To~c Substances Control. This meeting included regulators at federal, state and local levels of\ngovernment in California., as well as representatives from industry such as retailers and suppliers. EPA gave a\npresentation on efforts to date to address RCRA and the retail sector.\n\u2022 On June 9, 2015, EPA provided an overview of the Pharmaceuticals Rule and Generator Improvement Rule,\nas well as the planned Retail Sector Strategy, at a Northeast Waste Management Officials Association training\nworkshop in Sturbridge, MA.\n\u2022 During July 7-9, 2015, the Agency participated in a series of meetings and visits involving EPA Region 4, the\nAlabama Department of Environmental Management and the Georgia Department of Environmental\nResource's Environmental Protection Division. This included a meeting with Giant Cement Holding\nIncorporated representatives and tour of Giant Resource Recovery's aerosol processing/recycling facility.\nf G]\n\n\u2022 EPA participated in the RILA conference during September 14-17, 2015 in Austin, TX, at which time the\nAgency gave presentations on the proposed Hazardous Waste Pharmaceutical and Hazardous Waste\nGenerator Improvements rules as well as provided an update on the Agency's retail strategy. EPA also met\nwith representatives from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.\n\u2022 EPA participated in the Consumer Products Regulatory Compliance Workshop co-sponsored by the Personal\nCare Products Council and Consumer Specialty Products Association in Sacramento, CA during September\n29-30, 2015. EPA gave a presentation on the Agency's retail strategy and an overview of federal RCRA\nregulations as they pertain to the retail sector, including the proposed Hazardous Waste Pharmaceutical and\nHazardous Waste Generator Improvements rules.\n\u2022 On November 30, 2015 and December 1, 2015, the Agency participated in facility visits involving the\nPennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and New Jersey Department of Environmental\nProtection.

EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \n \n1. Introduction  \n \nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association (\u201cRILA\u201d) , the Food Marketing Institute (\u201cFMI\u201d), and \nthe National Association of Chain Drug Stores (\u201cNACDS\u201d), and their members (collectively, the \n\u201cRetail Associations\u201d) are pleased to submit these comments in response to  the proposal of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or the \u201cAgency\u201d) to classify and regulate \nhazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct (\u201cRCRA\u201d).  See 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654  (March 16 , 201 8).     \n \nRetailers sell a wide variety of aerosol products in our stores every day that are generally deemed \nsafe for consumption or use by ordinary consumers, and meet all applicable safety regulations. \nExamples include deodorants, hair styling products, shaving creams, cheese, sp ot removers, etc. \nIf a customer discards these products at home, he or she throws it out in the normal municipal \nwaste disposal or recycling stream.  However, when the same consumer product goes unsold by \na store or is returned to a store by a customer, it  may be classified as a \u201chazardous waste,\u201d \npotentially subjecting the store to the same burdensome hazardous waste generator regulations as \na steel mill or chemical plant.  \n \nBecause of the regulatory complexity and uncertainty, retailers often have little c hoice but to \nhandle all their unsold, returned, or used aerosols as fully regulated hazardous wastes, despite the \nfact that the products pose little or no risk to human health and the environment.  As a result \naerosol cans now account for up to 50 percent or more of the materials from the retail sector that \nare deemed to be hazardous wastes.  This imposes tremendous costs on the industry and makes \nrecycling difficult or impractical.  In order to address these issues, a number of states have \nstreamlined the requirements for aerosol wastes by classifying them as universal wastes.  \n \nThe Retail Associations greatly appreciate this opportunity to submit comments on the proposed \naddition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the federal universal waste regulations.  T his is also \nan important opportunity to further build our relationship and continue to work with the Agency \non ways to protect our customers and the environment, while streamlining the burdensome \nregulatory compliance process for our businesses \u2013 two goals  that are not mutually exclusive.  \n\n \n- 2 - \n \n \nWe would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input to EPA, and to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made in these comments.  \n \nSection 2 below provides a general summary of our co mments.  Section 3 provides background \non the Retail Associations and their interest in this rulemaking.  Section 4 expresses the \nAssociations\u2019 strong support for the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes \nas universal wastes, and pr ovides further reasons for such action.  Section 5 explains certain \nchanges to the scope of the proposed rule that we think are essential to make the rule workable \nand to maximize its benefits.  Section 6 urges EPA to clarify that as soon as the final rule  is \nissued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all states without a \nhazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  Section 7 explains why we believe \nthe Agency\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule dram atically underestimates the \ncost savings that could be achieved under  the proposal (with the changes we are suggesting).   \nSection 8 highlights the need for the Agency to issue guidance on certain fundamental issues \nrelated to aerosols, in addition to issui ng the universal waste rule , and Section 9 provides a brief \nconclusion.   Finally, we once again commend the Agency for this process and reiterate the \ncommitment of the Retail Associations to continuing to work with EPA to develop common \nsense regulations t hat protect our customers and the environment while not overburdening \nbusinesses with red tape and compliance costs.  \n \n2. Summary of Comments  \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes as universal wastes.  As discussed in Section 3 below, the Retail Associations \nrepresent a broad cross section of the retail industry \u2013 the economic sector that EPA recogniz es \nas having the largest percentage of entities affected by this rulemaking \u2013 and thus ha ve a strong \ninterest in the Agency\u2019s universal waste proposal.  We have been urging EPA to take this type of \naction for several years, and are pleased that the Agency has initiated the current rulemaking.  As \ndiscussed more fully in Section 4 below, we believe aerosol cans are particularly well suited for \naddition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all of the criteria specified in the \nregulations for classi fication as universal wastes.  For example, they are generated ubiquitously, \npose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated and non -regulated streams, and \nwould be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA hazardous waste r egulations \nwere not applied during generation, storage, transport, and collection.  In addition, they have \nbeen successfully managed as universal wastes in several states for many years.  \n \nWe are concerned, however, that the scope of the proposal has been unnecessarily and \ninappropriately narrowed in certain ways that would make the universal waste rule unworkable, \nespecially in the retail sector  (which EPA estimates represent s approximate two -thirds of the \naffected generator universe) .  In particular, as d iscussed in Section 5 below, the proposed rule \nwould require generators to make fine technical judgments about each individual aerosol can  in \norder to determine whether it can be managed as a universal waste .  Some of these technical \njudgments include : \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n \no Whether t he can  dispenses chemical products in the form of a foam or spray  (eligible for \nmanagement as a universal waste) or in the form of a gel or paste  (potentially not \neligible);  \n \no Whether the can expels only gas (potentially not eligible) or also exp els a solid or liquid \n(eligible);  \n \no Whether any dried spray, splatters, or drips o n the outside a re evidence of leakage \n(potentially not eligible) or simply usage (eligible); and  \n \no Whether the can is both \u201cempty\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d (in which case it might n ot be eligible), \neven though EPA has repeatedly said that it cannot clearly define when an aerosol can is \nempty or reactive.  \n \nWe question whether any generator could confidently make these types of judgments .  In any \nevent, in the retail sector, drawing a ll these distinctions would be hopelessly impractical, given \nthe extremely wide range of aerosol products being handled, the significant numbers of waste \naerosol cans  being generated , the limited experience o f most retail employees with these types of \nissues, and the high turnover of retail personnel.  Moreover, EPA has long maintained that one of \nthe key advantages of the universal waste rule is that it obviates the need for distinguishing \nbetween look-alike products.  For these reasons and others discusse d in Section 5, we urge the \nAgency  to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated products and gas -only \nproducts, by removing or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leaking or \ndamage, and by clarifying the status of empt y aerosol cans.   \n \nEPA  should also clarify that as soon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may \nimmediately be transported in all states without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste \ntransporter  \u2013 regardless of if/when the s tates adopt the universal waste rule .  As discussed in \nSection 6, even though states generally have the authority to impose hazardous waste rules that \nare more stringent than the federal regulations, they are preempted from imposing more stringent \nrules with respect to transport of hazardous wastes, as a result of the explicit preemption \nprovisions of the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act .  Clarifying this point would go \na long way toward accelerating and maximizing the benefits of the universal waste rule, \nespecially for companies that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes in multiple states ( e.g., \nnationwide or regional retailers)  and/or need or want to transport such wastes across state lines to \nan environmentally sound recycling or disposal facility.   EPA should also, as it has with other \nuniversal waste rules, encourage states to adopt the final rule and issue guidance specifying that \nthe Agency will not take enforcement actions involvi ng aerosol can universal wastes that are \nmanaged in compliance with the universal waste rule, regardless of whether the state has adopted \nthe rule or received authorization for the rule.     \n       \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings th at would result from the rule are likely \nfar greater than EPA estimated in its R egulatory Impact Analysis \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 \nmillion per year or more.  As discussed in Section 7 below, the Agency \u2019s primary methodology \nfor estimating the cost savings  was fundamentally flawed, in large part because it assumed that \n \n- 4 - \n \n \nretail stores (the largest category of affected generators) are similar to manufacturing facilities in \nthat only a very small percentage are likely to have their \u201cgenerator status \u201d (i.e., their status as \nLarge, Small, or Very Small Quantity Generator s) change as a result of the universal waste rule.  \nIn fact, however, the rule is likely to have a substantial effect on the generator status of retail \nfacilities ( e.g., stores, distribution center s, and return centers), since they commonly generate \nrelatively low volumes of hazardous wastes, and hazardous aerosol can wastes represent a \nsubstantial percentage  of such wastes .  Indeed, this is why the Retail Associations have been \nadvocating so strong ly over the last several years for a universal waste rule for aerosols.          \n \nFinally, t o further improv e the regulatory framework for aerosol cans,  we also urge the Agency \nto move forward on its separate commitment to issue guidance on when aerosol ca ns are subject \nto hazardous waste regulation in the first instance.  In particular, as discussed in Section 8 below, \nwe ask EPA to clarify (a) that aerosol cans destined for recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that \naerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of reactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty \nonce they are no longer capable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way \nas required for the intended application , and (d) that  generators may use statistical information to \ndetermine the quantity of aerosol cans that need to be counted in determining their hazardous \nwaste generator status .  EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final \nuniversal waste ru le, if that can be done without delaying the universal waste rule.   However, the \nfirst priority should be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, \nwhich can be followed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.  In any event, the Retail \nAssociations would welcome the opportunity to work with the Agency to ensure that the \nguidance encourages environmental sound management of used aerosols without imposing \nundue burdens on the regulated community.    \n \n3.  The Retail Associa tions and Their  Interest in This Rulemaking  \n  \nThe Retail Associations represent a broad cross section of the retail sector in the United States, \nincluding large and small companies, from chains with more than a thousand stores nationwide \nto regional compan ies with a handful of stores.   The vast majority of the members of each of the \nAssociations market aerosol products, have the potential to generate hazardous aerosol can \nwastes (as discussed further below), and therefore have a strong interest in the curre nt \nrulemaking.  Each of the individual Associations is described briefly below:  \n \no RILA is an organization of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative retailer and \nsupplier companies \u2013 the leaders of the retail industry.  RILA members represent more \nthan $1.5 trillion in annual sales and operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing \nfacilities, and distribution centers nationwide.  Our member retailers and suppliers have \nfacilities in all 50 states and the District of Col umbia, as well as internationally, and \nemploy millions of workers domestically and worldwide.  \n \no FMI proudly advocates on behalf of the food retail industry, which employs nearly 5 \nmillion workers and represents a combined annual sales volume of almost  $800 \nbillion.   FMI member companies operate nearly 33,000 retail food stores and 12,000 \npharmacies.   FMI membership includes the entire spectrum of food retail venues : single \n \n- 5 - \n \n \nowner grocery stores, large multi -store supermarket chains, pharmacies, online and \nmixed retail stores.   Through programs in public affairs, food safety, research, education, \nhealth and wellness and industry relations, FMI offers resources and provides val uable \nbenefits to almost 1,000 food retail and wholesale member companies and serves 85 \ninternational retail member companies.   In addition, FMI has almost 500 associate \nmember companies that provide products and services to the food retail industry.     \n \no NACDS represents traditional drug stores, supermarkets , and mass merchants with \npharmacies.  Chains operate 40,000 pharmacies, and NACDS\u2019 nearly 100 chain member \ncompanies include regional chains, with a minimum of four stores, and national \ncompanies.  Chains employ nearly 3 million individuals, including 152,000 pharmacists.  \nThey fill over 3 billion prescriptions yearly, and help patients use medicines correctly and \nsafely, while offering innovative services that improve patient health and healthcare \naffordability.  NACDS members also include more than 900 supplier partners and over \n70 international members representing 20 countries.  \n \nThe Retail Associations and their members have a clear and strong interest in this rulemaking.  \nIndeed, EPA, in the pre amble to the proposal , stated that \u201c[the] economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the \nlargest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade industry \u2026 representing \n65% of the affected Large Quantity Generator universe.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Retailers, \nincluding members  of the Associations , market an extremely wide range of aerosol products, \nincluding but not limited to the following:  \n \n\uf0a7 Adhesives  \n\uf0a7 Air fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Air horn s \n\uf0a7 Antifungal treatments  \n\uf0a7 Antistatic agents  \n\uf0a7 Artificial snow  \n\uf0a7 Bathroom cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Carpet cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Cooking oils  \n\uf0a7 Cheese  \n\uf0a7 Deodorants  \n\uf0a7 Disinfectants  \n\uf0a7 Engine degreasers  \n\uf0a7 Fabric fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Fabric protectors  \n\uf0a7 First aid products  \n\uf0a7 Floor cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Foam insulation  \uf0a7 Furniture polishes  \n\uf0a7 Hair styling products  \n\uf0a7 Lubricants  \n\uf0a7 Novelties  \n\uf0a7 Oven cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Paints  \n\uf0a7 Perfumes  \n\uf0a7 Pesticides  \n\uf0a7 Shaving creams  \n\uf0a7 Starter fluids  \n\uf0a7 Sealants  \n\uf0a7 Spot removers  \n\uf0a7 Starch  \n\uf0a7 Sunscreens  \n\uf0a7 Tanning products  \n\uf0a7 Varnishes  \n\uf0a7 Waterproofing treatments  \n\uf0a7 Whipped dessert toppings  \n \nOf course, the vast majority of aerosols handled by retailers are not wastes in their hands, but \nrather are sold to customers and ultimately disposed or recycled (after use) by the customers.  \nNevertheless, significan t amounts are either returned by customers or are unsold due to various \n \n- 6 - \n \n \nreasons ( e.g., damage, defect, recall, obsolescence, expiration, seasonal product changes, or \nremoval from shelves due to failure to \u201csell through\u201d at an acceptable rate).  Most of the se \nunsold/returned items are not wastes, because they are suitable for re -shelving, liquidation sale \nthrough a secondary market, donation to non -profit organizations, or shipment to a manufacturer \nor its agent for credit.  In some instances, however, the u nsold/returned aerosol products do \nbecome wastes, and depending upon their composition, may be classified as hazardous wastes.  \nMembers of the Retail Associations have reported that aerosols represent up to 50% (by weight) \nor even more of all the potential ly hazardous unsold/returned products that they handle.   \nRetailers may also generate smaller amounts of aerosol can wastes in other ways, such as \nthrough cleaning/maintenance of buildings, equipment, and vehicles, constructing product \ndisplays, preparing f oods and beverages, providing various services to customers, and \nconducting routine office/administrative functions.   In light of all these potential mechanisms for \ngenerating hazardous aerosol can wastes, the Retail Associations , their members, and the re tail \nsector more broadly, have a strong interest in the current rulemaking.                   \n \n4. The Retail Associations  Strongly Support the Classification and Regulation of \nHazardous Aerosol Can Wastes as Universal Wastes   \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the addition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the \nRCRA universal waste rule.  Indeed, the Associations have been urging the Agency take this step \nfor several years, such as in comments submitted together with another retail sector trade \nassociation ( i.e., the National Retail Federation) on EPA\u2019s 2014 Notice of Data Availability \n(\u201cNODA\u201d) on the application of RCRA to retailers.  See Comments of the Retail Associations in \nResponse to EPA\u2019s NODA on the Application of RCRA to the Retail Indus try (May 30, 2014)  \n(EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-RCRA -2012 -0426 -0038)  (\u201cRetail Associations NODA Comments\u201d) \n(Attachment 1 to the current comments) at 26 -31.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , also \nencouraged EPA to adopt a universal waste rule for aerosol c an wastes as part of t he Agency\u2019s \nregulatory reform efforts under Executive Order 13777.  See Comments of the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association on EPA\u2019s Request for Public Comment on \u201c Evaluation of Existing \nRegulations\u201d (May 15, 2017)  (EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-2017 -0190 -32612)  (\u201cRILA Regulatory \nReform Comments\u201d)  (Attachment 2) at 8-13.     \n \nEPA has presented a compelling case for classification of hazardous aerosol can wastes as \nuniversal wastes in the preamble to the current proposal.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 1 1,658 -59.  \nHowever, w e provide below some additional support demonstrating that aerosol cans meet each \nof the criteria set forth in the RCRA regulations for additions to the list of universal wastes.1  In \nshort, aerosol cans are perfectly suited for manage ment under the u niversal waste  program since \nthey are generated ubiquitously, pose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated \nand non -regulated streams, and would be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA \nhazardous waste regulations were not applied during generation, collection, and transport.  \nMoreover, a number of states (including environmental leaders such as California and Colorado ) \n                                                 \n1  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81.   It is worth noting that EPA has stressed that \u201cit does not believe that each and \nevery factor must be met in order for a waste to be appropriate for the universal waste system, and for regulation of \nthe waste under part 273 to improve waste management an d implementation.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,513  \n(May 11, 1995)  (stating further that \u201cthe Agency will make decisions based on the weight of the evidence\u201d).   \n \n- 7 - \n \n \nhave long classified and regulated aerosol cans as universal wastes, and their programs for doing \nso appear to have been highly successful.   \n \no CRITERION #1:   The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of \ngenerators, is listed in subpa rt D of part 261 of this chapter, or (if not listed) a \nproportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste \nidentified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(a)]   \n \n As EPA notes in the preamble to t he proposal, aerosol cans may exhibit the RCRA \ncharacteristic of ignitability if they contain flammable propellants such as propane or \nbutane.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,656.  In addition, discarded aerosol cans may be \nhazardous if they contain commercial che mical products that either exhibit a hazardous \ncharacteristic or are listed as hazardous wastes.  Id.   While in many instances it may be \ndifficult for a generator to determine if the aerosol can wastes it generates are hazardous \nor not, there can be no do ubt that many  waste aerosol cans  are hazardous.      \n \n Of course, many \u2013 perhaps even most \u2013 aerosol cans are not hazardous .  Nevertheless, \nhazardous aerosol  can waste s can and should still be designated as universal wastes.  \nIndeed, EPA has long recognized  that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule \nis that it \u201celiminates [the need for] identifying, documenting, and keeping separate \nregulated waste and unregulated waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,513.  The Agency noted \nthat it \u201cwishes to encoura ge persons to manage both regulated waste and unregulated \nwaste in the same collection systems \u2026 [a]s long as all commingled waste is managed in \na system that meets the requirements of the universal waste regulations.\u201d  Id.  EPA \nindicated that this approac h was particularly attractive in situations where \u201can across the \nboard hazardous waste determination [could not be made] for entire categories of waste\u201d \nand/or where a waste \u201ceither becomes hazardous or is no longer hazardous due to \nchanges in manufacturin g practices [or product composition].\u201d  Id.  Given the difficulty \nin determining which waste aerosols are hazardous and which are not, they seem to be an \nideal candidate for designation as universal wastes.  \n \no CRITERION #2:   The waste or category of waste  is not exclusive to a specific industry \nor group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of \nestablishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, \noffice complexes, conditionally exempt small quantity  generators, small businesses, \ngovernment organizations, as well as large industrial facilities).  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.81(b)]  \n \n As discussed above, the retail industry handle s a significant amount of unsold/returned \naerosol cans.  However, a much larger quant ity of waste aerosol cans are generated by the \npersons and entities that purchase and use aerosol products.  Households are by far \n \n- 8 - \n \n \ncollectively the largest generators of such wastes.2  However, a wide variety of \nbusinesses generate  aerosol wastes , as well,  by using the products.    \n \n In the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule, EPA identifies 18 industries \nwith large and small quantity generators that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes.  See \n83 Fed. Reg. at 11,638.  However, we believe that the range of generators of such wastes \nis much broader.   For example, vehicle fleet owners and service centers commonly use \naerosol lubricants, paints, sealants, and the like, and the same is true for virtually anyone \nwho owns or services industrial equipment.  Office buildings and cleaning services use a \nvariety of aerosol cleaning products for both hard surfaces ( e.g., wood polish, bathroom \ncleaners, etc.) and fabric surfaces ( e.g., carpet cleaners and upholstery fresheners).  \nHealthcare facilities use aerosol disinfectants.  Exterminators and businesses with pest \ncontrol problems use aerosol pesticides.  Hair salons use aerosol hair sprays, styling gels, \nand the like.  Laundries and dry cleaners use aerosol spot removers and fabric protectors.  \nRestaurants use aerosol cooking sprays, and other food products.  The list of businesses, \nlarge and small, that use products dispensed with aerosol cans and generate the cans as \nwastes is almost endless.  Moreover, federal, state, and local government agencies  are \nalso major users and generators of aerosols, inasmuch as they operate large office \nbuildings, infrastructure facilities, healthcare centers, schools, parks, and facilities where \nlarge numbers of individuals are housed ( e.g., military installations and  prisons).  \nAlthough most of these commercial /government users of products in aerosol cans are not \nrequired to handle the used cans as hazardous wastes ( e.g., because they qualify as Very \nSmall Quantity Generators (\u201c VSQGs \u201d)), they collectively constitute a  major portion of \nthe used aerosol can stream.  \n \n Clearly, waste  aerosol cans are generated ubiquitously in an extremely wide range of \nsettings, both industrial and not.  This fact makes them ideal candidates for the universal \nwaste rule.  EPA has long str essed that \u201c[o]ne of the problems the universal waste rule is \ndesigned to address is that a relatively large portion of some waste types are exempt from \nthe hazardous waste regulations ( i.e., are generated by households and CESQGs  [i.e., \nConditionally Exem pt Small Quantity Generators] ) and are indistinguishable from the \nregulated portion of the waste.  This \u2018look alike\u2019 problem makes implementation of the \n[standard RCRA] program for these wastes extremely difficult.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at \n25,514.  Aerosol ca ns appear to be precisely the type of material that EPA had in mind.  \nA large proportion of aerosol cans are generated as wastes by exempt household s and \nVSQGs, but regulated entities generate a substantial amount of aerosol wastes, as well, \nand such waste s are typically indistinguishable from the aerosols generated by exempt \npersons.             \n \n \n                                                 \n2  See, e.g. , European Aerosol Federation, \u201cAnnual Report 2017\u201d (Attachment 3) at 17 (indicati ng that 55.5% \nof aerosol products produced in Europe are personal care products, and an additional 20.7% are household \nproducts).   \n \n- 9 - \n \n \no CRITERION #3:   The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of \ngenerators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in re latively \nsmall quantities by each generator.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c)]  \n \n Virtually all households in the U.S. can be expected to generate at least some waste \naerosol cans.  That alone accounts for approximately 100 million generators, making the \nwastes amon g the most  common potentially hazardous wastes generated in the country.  \nAlthough these generators would be excluded from regulation under the household waste \nexclusion, the numbers of business, government, and other institutional generators that \nare pote ntially regulated (unless they qualify as VSQGs) is similarly very large.  The \nRetail Associations estimate that the number of retail establishments in the United States \nhandling unsold/returned aerosols is likely well over 100,000 (based on Census data on  \nthe number of retailers i n key sectors that can be expected to market (and thus handle \nunsold/returned) aerosol products ).3  We have not made an effort to quantify the number \nof generating establishments in other industries, but given the wide range of su ch \nindustries (as noted above), it seems almost certain that the numbers of such generators \nwould be in the millions.   \n \n The amounts generated by each generator likely vary substantially.  Members of the \nRetail Associations report that individual stores often handle up to 1000 lbs/year of \nunsold/returned aerosol cans.  Each household user of aerosols presumably generates a \nfairly limited number of waste aerosol cans each month or year.  Business users of \naerosol products may generate somewhat larger amount s, depending upon their size and \nthe nature of their operations.  However, it might reasonably be expected that if a facility \nrequires a very large amount of a particular chemical product, it might be more likely to \nuse a different means of application.  F or example, a facility that uses large quantities of \nspray paint would likely obtain a bulk liquid paint that could be aerosolized using \ncompressed gas, rather than using individual aerosol cans.  Accordingly, it appears that \nwaste aerosol cans are generat ed by large numbers of generators, most commonly in \nrelatively small quantities.          \n \no CRITERION #4:   Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste \n(including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship \nof the waste.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(d)]  \n \n EPA has stated that \u201cthe goal of this factor is to facilitate addition of wastes to the \nuniversal waste system that are most likely to be collected, and to be collected in a \nmanner that ensures good mana gement of the waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,514.  The \nRetail Associations believe that aerosol cans are precisely the type of materials that EPA \nhad in mind.  As an initial matter, aerosol cans constitute a large stream that is readily \n                                                 \n3  See U.S. Census Bureau, \u201cStatistical Abstract of the United States: 2012,\u201d Table 1048 (data as of 2008) \n(Attachment 4) (indicating that there are 114,100 gasoline stations, 63,400 supermarkets and grocery stores, 25,700 \nconvenience stores, 56,100 automotive parts/accessories/tire stores, 42,000 pharmacies and drug stores, 23,000 \nhome centers and hardware stores, 22,100 sport ing goods stores, 19,800 lawn and garden stores, 14,000 \ncosmetics/beauty supplies/perfume stores, and 4,400 warehouse clubs and superstores).   \n \n- 10 - \n \n \nidentifiable and e asy to segregate for special management.  Indeed, many of the key \nelements needed for proper stewardship of this waste stream are already in place.  \nAccording to a study organized by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition  (\u201cSPC\u201d) , \napproximately 70% of America ns have access to curbside or drop -off recycling facilities \nthat accept aluminum or steel aerosol cans.  See SPC, \u201c2015 -16 Centralized Study on \nAvailability of Recycling for Aerosol Containers\u201d (Attachment 5).  In addition, several \nmajor waste services pro viders have developed and are marketing programs for collecting \nand recycling waste aerosol cans from consumer and/or business generators.   \n \n Notwithstanding these efforts, it appears that vast quantities of aerosol cans are simply \nbeing disposed of by co nsumers in the ordinary trash.  Designating aerosol cans as \nuniversal wastes would significantly facilitate collection and recycling programs, and \nwould encourage use  of such programs .4  The requirements of the universal waste rule \nwould also ensure that t hese activities are performed in a manner that is protective of \nhuman health and the environment.              \n \no CRITERION #5:   The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during \naccumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardou s wastes, and \nspecific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appropriate to be added to 40 CFR 273.13, 273.33, and \n273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be \nprotective of human health and the environment during accumulation and transport.   \n[40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e)]  \n \n Waste  or unsold/returned aerosol cans present relatively low risks during accumulation \nand transport.  As an initial matter, these aerosol cans are the same as the aerosol cans \nthat are distributed and used regularly by households and businesses of virtually every \ntype, except that they generally contain significantly less of the propellant and chemical \nproduct than the unused items.  Moreover, as not ed above, over half of all aerosol wastes \nappear to be generated by households, and are frequently disposed of in the ordinary \ntrash.   \n \n It is particularly noteworthy that aerosol cans are not \u201cnaked\u201d chemicals, as might be the \ncase, for example, with bul k pesticides (some of which are already classified as universal \nwastes).  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.3 (classifying certain pesticides as universal wastes).  \nRather, aerosols by their very nature are engineered devices  \u2013 devices  that by law must \nmeet U.S. Departm ent of Transport (\u201c DOT \u201d) requirements for design, filling, testing, \n                                                 \n4  As just one example, in states that regulate household hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes once they are \ncollected, the universal waste rule would enable collected household hazardous aerosol can wastes to be stored at the \ncollection site and transported to an ultimate recycling/disposal facility in accordance with the universal waste \nrequirements, rather than t he full hazardous waste regulations.  See Rhode Island Rules and Regulation for \nHazardous Waste Management, Rule 5.1(b)(1) (\u201cowners and/or operators of facilities that accept household \nhazardous waste \u2026 shall comply with the requirements for Large Quantity  Generators \u2026 and upon receipt the \nhousehold hazardous waste shall be subject to full regulation as hazardous waste\u201d); Minnesota Admin. R. \n7045.0310(3) (\u201cAn operator who establishes or operates all or part of a household hazardous waste management \nprogram must comply with the standards applicable to large quantity generators [with limited exceptions]\u201d).    \n \n- 11 - \n \n \nability to withstand heat and shock, etc.  See generally 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3).  These \nrequirements help minimize risks during both accumulation and transport.  Moreover, \nduring transp ort, the used aerosols, like unused aerosols, are subject to additional DOT \ncontrols.  For example, the aerosols must be packed in strong outer packagings, which \namong other things, must meet general packaging requirements for protectiveness.  See \n49 C.F.R . \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(iv) and 171.8 (defining \u201cstrong outer packaging\u201d).  In addition, \nthe outer packagings must be specially marked.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(i).  As EPA \nnotes in the preamble to the proposal, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,658, local fire codes also \nprovide comprehensive protections during storage of aerosols ( e.g., package markings, \nstorage quantity limits, design of storage areas, fire alarm systems, fire protection \nsystems such as sprinklers, etc.).  See, e.g. , National Fire Protection Association \n(\u201cNFPA \u201d) Fire Code (2018), Chapter 61 (Aerosol Products) (Attachment 6).  These DOT \nand fire code requirements should obviate the need for further regulation during \naccumulation and transport.      \n \n To the extent that any additional regulation might be  warranted, the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rules should be sufficient.  They require that the wastes be stored in a \nprotective manner, that containers be labeled and marked to indicate their contents, that \nemployees be trained, that any releases b e addressed appropriately, and that the wastes be \nsent to a properly authorized facility in a timely fashion.  In addition, if a facility \ngenerates or accumulates large quantities, they must notify EPA and track all shipments \nof the waste into and out of t he facility.  These safeguards have proven highly effective \nfor other universal wastes, and the Retail Associations  believe they would likewise be \neffective for aerosol cans (as demonstrated in California , Colorado , and other states, as \ndiscussed below in the context of Criterion #8 ).         \n \no CRITERION #6:   Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted from non -hazardous waste \nmanagement systems (e.g., the municipal waste s tream, non -hazardous industrial or \ncommercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, \ntreatment, or disposal in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(f)]  \n \n The determination of whether individual aerosol cans a re wastes or non -wastes, and \nhazardous or non -hazardous, can be extremely difficult.   See generally  Retail \nAssociations NODA Comments at 17 -20.  With so many generators in so many different \nindustries, many of which do not generally handle hazardous wastes  and thus are \nparticularly unsuited to making a proper determination, it is almost inevitable that \nmistakes will be made.  Indeed, some generators may not even be aware of the need to \nmake a determination or the possible implications of a hazardous waste d etermination.  \nThis is especially true given that the waste aerosol cans are in many cases identical to, or \nat least similar to, the products that business employees use and discard at their \nhouseholds and therefore are excluded from RCRA regulation.  Thus , it seems likely that \nlarge numbers of generators of potentially hazardous aerosol cans are routinely disposing \nof such products in the ordinary trash.  \n \n \n- 12 - \n \n \n Regulating aerosol cans as universal wastes would significantly reduce this problem.  As \nEPA noted in the final rule designating lamps as universal wastes, \u201cthe streamlined \nrequirements of the universal waste program will give [unsophisticated] generators a \nmore accessible starting point for good environmental management.  If regulatory \nrequirements are simpler, \u2026 more hazardous waste[s] will be handled properly \u2026 \ninstead of going to solid waste landfills or to municipal waste combustors.  Improved \nmanageme nt will \u2026 lead to a reduction in the total amount of hazardous waste emissions \nto the environment.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. 36,466, 36,473 (July 6, 1999).   \n \n Moreover, regulating waste aerosol cans as universal waste s would encourage better \nmanagement of such w astes by more sophisticated generators.  For example, such \ngenerators would have less reason to try drawing fine distinctions between used aerosol \ncans that are wastes versus non -wastes, or hazardous versus non -hazardous.  Many \ngenerators \u2013 perhaps most \u2013 would simply direct all their used aerosol cans through the \nuniversal waste system.  EPA has previously acknowledged that this type of result can be \nan important reason for designating wastes as universal.5  Moreover, a universal waste \ndesignation would fa cilitate consolidation of waste aerosol cans from multiple facilities \nand/or generators, which in turn would provide economies of scale that would likely \nmake recycling options more viable.6                \n \no CRITERION #7:   Regulation of the waste or categ ory of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory \nprogram.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(g)]  \n \n Designating aerosol cans as universal wastes would not only encourage environmentally \npreferred outcome s, as noted above, but would also improve implementation and \ncompliance.  Not only would generators generally be relieved of the requirement to \nassess whether individual cans are wastes or non -wastes, and hazardous or non -\nhazardous, but the same would be t rue for federal and state inspection and enforcement \npersonnel.  Thus, implementation would certainly be improved.  Moreover, as EPA has \nnoted, \u201c[i]f regulatory requirements are simpler [as a result of a universal waste rule], the \ncompliance rate will impr ove.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 36,473; see also  70 Fed. Reg. at \n45,511 (\u201cadding [waste] to the universal waste rule will improve compliance with the \nhazardous waste regulations by making it more achievable\u201d).     \n \n                                                 \n5  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,515 (\u201cdiversion of unregulated portions of a waste \u2026 from non -hazardous \nmanagement systems could be a reason to add a waste to the universal waste system.  For example, in some cases it \nmay be likely that facilitating the collection of commingled regulated and unregulated waste would encourage \ndevelopment of collection systems that could divert significant quantities of the waste,  including unregulated waste, \nfrom non -hazardous waste management systems\u201d).   \n \n6  Cf. 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,511 (August 5, 2005) (a universal waste designation \u201cwill allow generators \u2026 \nto send [their wastes] to a central consolidation point. \u2026  Under th e universal waste rule, a handler of universal \nwaste can send the universal waste to another handler, where it can be consolidated into a larger shipment for \ntransport to a [recycling] facility\u201d).  \n \n \n- 13 - \n \n \no CRITERION #8:  Such o ther factors as may be appropriate.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81( h)] \n  \n As EPA notes in the proposal, the fact that aerosol can wastes have successfully been \nmanaged as universal wastes under existing programs ( e.g., in California and Colorado) \n\u201cweighs in favor of concluding that manage ment of aerosol cans under the federal \nuniversal waste regulations is likely to be successful.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,659.  \nHowever, the Agency has understated the extent to which aerosols are already being \nmanaged as universal wastes.   \n \n At the present  time, a total of six states allow aerosol can wastes in general to be handled \nas universal wastes.7  Moreover, additional states allow particular categories of aerosol \ncan wastes ( e.g., aerosol paint wastes  or pharmaceutical aerosol wastes ) to be managed as \nuniversal wastes.8  Indeed, even the federal universal waste rule appears to cover aerosol \npesticide wastes  in some circumstances.  See 40 C.F.R.  \u00a7 273.3 (covering, for example, \nunused pesticide products that are collected and managed as part of a waste  pesticide \ncollection program).  As far as we are aware, all of these programs have been successful \nin facilitating the proper management of the aerosol can wastes that they cover.   \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above and in the preamble for the propos ed rule , aerosol cans are \nideal candidates for inclusion in the universal waste rule.  Such a change would be of substantial \nbenefit to the retail industry, but would also benefit a host of other business, government, and \nother institutional generators of aerosol wastes, as well as federal and state environmental \nagencies.  We therefore urge EPA to finalize the proposed rule (with the changes and \nclarifications discussed in detail below) as soon as p ossible . \n \n5. EPA Should Modify the Scope of the Universal Waste Rule for Hazardous A erosol \nCan Wastes to Ensure the Rule Is Workable and Provides Maximum Benefits  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  are strongly supportive of adding hazardous aerosol can wastes \nto the universal waste rule, we are concerned that EPA \u2019s proposal unnecessarily and \ninappropriately limits the scope of the rule by (a) narrowly defining the term \u201caerosol can,\u201d (b) \nexcluding aerosol cans with \u201cevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage,\u201d and (c) including an \nexclusion for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans that is expressed in a manner that may cause some to believe \n                                                 \n7  See California Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16; 6 Color ado Code Regs. 1007 -3, Section 273.2(d); New \nMexico Admin. Code 20.4.1.1001; Utah Admin. Code Rule 315 -273-6(b); Ohio Admin.

Code 7:26A -1.3 (defining universal wastes to include oil -based finishes, and \ndefinin g oil-based finishes to include \u201caerosol paint cans\u201d); 25 Pennsylvania Admin.

Code \u00a7 335.262 (classifying and regulating \u201cpaint and paint -related wastes\u201d as \nuniversal wastes); Michigan R. 335.262 (classifying and regulating pharmaceutical wastes as universal wastes); \nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality, \u201cUniversal Waste Ph armaceutical s\u201d (July 2012) (Attachment 8) \n(\u201cUniversal Waste Pharmaceuticals \u2026 may be liquid, solid, paste, or aerosol \u201d (emphasis added)).   \n \n- 14 - \n \n \nthat certain empty aerosol cans are ineligible for management as universal wastes.  As discussed \nbelow, these limits have no rational basis .  In addition, by requiring generators to make fine \ntechnical judgments about each individual aerosol can that they generate as wastes, these limits \nwould render the universal waste rule unworkable, especially in the retail sector (which EPA \nestimates represents approximately two -thirds of the affected generat or universe).   This is one of \nthe things that the universal waste rule was specifically designed to avoid.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. \nReg. at 25,513 ( stating that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule is that it \n\u201celiminates [the need for] identifyin g, documenting, and keeping separate regulated waste and \nunregulated waste\u201d ).  Accordingly, we urge EPA to eliminate these limitations in the final rule.    \n \n 5.1 Definition of Aerosol  \n \nUnder the proposed rule, an aerosol can would be defined as \u201can intact container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray \nor foam.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,664  (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 260.10 and \n273.9).  As discussed below, the Retail Associations  are concerned that this definition is \nunnecessarily and inappropriately narrow, and that it would complicate and potentially \nundermine implementation of the universal waste rul e.  Accordingly, we request that EPA \nexpand the definition, for example by aligning it with the corresponding definition under \ninternational dangerous goods regulations.  We also request that EPA delete the reference to \n\u201cintact,\u201d because it is unnecessary and likely to create confusion, especially in light of the \nseparate proposed exclusion for aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage \nthat could cause leakage (discussed further below).    \n \nThe proposed definition would exclude two sig nificant categories of products commonly viewed \nas aerosol products, each of which is discussed separately below:  \n \n(1) Products that use compressed/liquefied gas to expel materials without aerating them or \nproducing a spray or foam  \u2013 Common examples of pro ducts in this category that might \nbe found in a retail store would include cans of shaving gel, \u201cspray\u201d cheese, and novelty \nplastic string streamers.  There is no apparent reason for excluding these types of \nproducts from the universal waste rule.  Indeed,  the DOT Hazardous Materials \nRegulations (\u201cHMR\u201d) classify these products as aerosols and regulate them in the same \nmanner as products that aerate materials and produce sprays or foams.9  Similarly, the \nNFPA defines an aerosol container in a way that is independent of whether the material \nbeing dispensed is aerated or produces a spray o r foam.10  Accordingly, we believe that \nthe universal waste rule should similarly cover these products.  \n \n                                                 \n9  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.8 (defining an aerosol as \u201can article consisting of any non -refillable receptacle \ncontaining a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a \u2026 liquid, \npaste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device allowing the contents to be ejected by the gas\u201d).   \n \n10  See NFPA Code 30B, Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 (defining an aerosol container as a metal can or plastic \ncontainer that uses \u201cliquefied or compressed gas [to] expel[ ] the cont ents \u2026 when [a] valve is actuated\u201d).   \n \n \n- 15 - \n \n \n(2) Products that contain and expel only gas  \u2013 Common use examples of products in this \ncategory that might be found in a retail store would include  compressed gas dusters and \npneumatic horns.  The proposed regulatory definition of aerosol would not necessa rily \nexclude these products, since they are articles in which \u201cgas under pressure is used to \naerate and dispense any material [in this case the gas itself] through a valve in the form of \na spray .\u201d  However, the preamble to the proposal seems to indicate th at EPA intends to \nexclude gas -only products.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (\u201ccompressed gas canisters \u2026 \nwould not be included\u201d).  The only rationale the Agency gives is that these products \nallegedly \u201cpresent a greater risk than aerosol cans.\u201d   Id.  However, as far as we can tell, \nthere is no evidence of such increased risk.  Indeed, international rules for the transport of \ndangerous goods explicitly classify gas -only products as aerosols and regulate them in the \nsame way as aerosols that expel other materials .11  Moreover, under the existing DOT \nregulations, gas -only products are regulated in much the same way as aerosols, and DOT \nis currently considering a petition to align the definition of aerosol under the HMR with \nthe international definition in order to explicitly cover gas -only products.12  Accordingly, \nwe believe that these products pose essentially the same risks as products with gases that \nexpel other materials, and that they should therefore also be covered by the universal \nwaste rule.  \n \nNot only would the exclusion of these products be unnecessary and inappropriate, but it would \nalso substantially complicate and undermine implementation of the rule.  If these products are \nexcluded, generators and other handlers might effectively be required to inspect e ach and every \naerosol can to determine whether it is a non -aerating product or a gas -only product ineligible for \nmanagement as universal waste.  Failure to do so might require the generator/handler to handle \nall of its aerosol wastes as (non -universal) haz ardous wastes, which would render the universal \nwaste rule a nullity.  However, performing the inspection would be extremely challenging and \nmight even be a non -starter.  This is especially true in the retail sector, given the exceptionally \nbroad range of aerosol products carried by many stores, and the generally limited experience and \nhigh turnover of personnel in the sector.        \n \nIn the preamble to the proposal, EPA also states that the proposed definition would have the \nadvantage of \u201ckeep[ing] consist ency with the existing state [universal waste] programs [covering \naerosols].\u201d  However, two state universal waste programs already cover non -aerating products \n                                                 \n11  See, e.g. , United Nations Recommendations on Transport of Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations (\u201cUN \nModel Regulations\u201d), Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9) (\u201cAerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a \nnon-refillable receptacle \u2026 containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved under pressure, with or without a \nliquid, paste or powder , and fitted with a release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid \nparticles in suspension in a  gas, as a foam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state \u201d (emphasis \nadded)).   \n \n12  See 49 C.F.R. 173.306 (rules for limited quantities of compressed gases, including those in aerosol and \nnon-aerosol products); Petition of the Consumer Sp ecialty Products Association, the Council on Safe Transportation \nof Hazardous Articles, Inc., the National Aerosol Association, and the American Coatings Association to DOT \n(September 28, 2017) (Attachment 10) (stressing the safety of \u201cpure gas units used in consumer and industrial \n[applications]\u201d).   \n \n \n- 16 - \n \n \nand/or gas -only products.13  Moreover, as noted above, regulations that apply across the nation \nand/or internationally generally include these products.  Accordingly, the best way to maintain \nconsistency with existing regulatory regimes would be to define aerosol cans in a way that \nincludes non -aerating and gas -only products.    \n   \nIn light of the abov e, we urge EPA to change the proposed definition of aerosol can to enable \nnon-aerated and gas -only products to be managed as universal wastes, for example by adopting \nthe definition used in international dangerous goods regulations : \n \n   Aerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a  non-refillable receptacle \u2026 \nmade of metal, glass or plastics and containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved \nunder pressure, with or without a liquid, paste or powder, and fitted with a release device \nallowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a \nfoam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state . \n \nSee, e.g. , UN Model Regulations, Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9).   \n \nWe also urge EPA to delete the requirement that aerosol products be \u201cintact\u201d to be considered \naerosol cans.  This requirement seems unnecessary since the proposal includes a separate \nprovision (discussed further below) excluding aerosol cans that show evid ence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage that could cause leakage from the universal waste rule.  Moreover, inclusion \nof the word \u201cintact\u201d may cause significant confusion by raising questions as to whether the \nstandard for an intact aerosol can is different fr om the standard for determining whether an \naerosol can shows evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage (although \nthe preamble to the proposed rule indicates that the standards are meant to be the same, saying \nthat \u201c[t]hrough this ex clusion [for leaking/damaged aerosol cans], EPA intends that hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans that are not intact  continue to be subject to the full hazardous waste \nstandards,\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (emphasis added)).    \n \n 5.2 Exclusion for Leaking/Damage d Aerosols  \n      \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage \nunder reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d   See 52 Fed. Reg. a t 11,665 (proposed to be codified at \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)( 4)).  EPA claims that this exclusion is necessary because \u201cthe proposed \n[universal waste] management standards \u2026 rel[y] in part on the fact that the aerosol cans to be \nmanaged \u2026  are not leaking or otherwise damaged [in a way] where contents or propellants \ncould be dispersed \u2026 [or where there might be] an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  As \ndiscussed below, this exclusion is inconsistent with the current rules for other universal wastes, it \n                                                 \n13  See, e.g. , Ohio Admin.

N one of the existing federal universal waste rules for \nother products exclude leaking or damaged products.  Instead, the rules simply require more \nprotec tive packaging for leaking/damaged products:  \n \no For batteries, handlers \u201cmust contain any universal waste battery that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions\u201d in a container that is \u201cc losed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents \nof the battery, and \u2026 lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions .\u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(a)(1) and \n273.33(a)(1).   \n \no Universal waste pesticides must be contained in a container that is \u201c closed, structurally \nsound, compatible with the pesticide, and that lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ,\u201d or in a \ncontain er that does not meet these standards ( e.g., a leaking container), \u201c provided that the \nunacceptable container is overpacked in a container that does meet the requirements .\u201d  \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( b)(1)-(2) and 273.33( b)(1)-(2).           \n \no Handler s of universal waste mercury -containing equipment \u201c must place in a container \nany [such] equipment with non -contained elemental mercury or that shows evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions ,\u201d and the container must be \u201cclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the device, must lack evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions, and must be reasonably designed \nto preve nt the escape of mercury into the environment by volatilization or any other \nmeans. \u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( c)(1) and 273.33( c)(1). \n \no With respect to universal waste lamps, handler s \u201cmust place in a container any lamp that \nshows evidence of breakage, le akage, or damage that could cause the release of mercury \nor other hazardous constituents to the environment ,\u201d and such c ontainers must be \u201cclosed, \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the lamps and must lack evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of mercury or other \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foreseeable conditions. \u201d   \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( d)(2) and 273.33( d)(2). \n \nEPA has provided no meaningful rationale for departing fr om this approach for aerosol cans.  \nNor do we believe any such rationale exists.  Just as with leaking/damaged batteries, pesticide \ncontainers (which may include some aerosol cans), mercury -containing equipment, and lamps, \nleaking/damaged aerosol cans can safely be managed as universal wastes if they are packaged in \nsuitably protective containers ( e.g., containers that are closed, structurally sound, compatible \nwith the contents of the aerosols, and lack evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could \n \n- 18 - \n \n \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ).  The use of protective containers is \nalready required for all aerosol cans under EPA\u2019s proposed rule.14  Thus, there is n o need to \nexclude leak ing/damaged aerosol cans.15 \n    \nMoreover, the criteria that E PA proposes for determining when aerosol cans would be excluded \nare so vague that they would create confusion in the regulated community and invite arbitrary \nenforcement by regulators, effectively undermining the benefits of the entire universal waste rule  \nfor aerosol cans.  We recognize that the criteria are similar to the standards that currently trigger \nmore protective packaging for other universal wastes ( i.e., whether the aerosol cans \u201c show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leak age under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions \u201d).  However, the criteria are uniquely problematic for aerosol cans, in part because \naerosol cans \u2013 unlike other universal waste items (with the exception of aerosol pesticides and \nperhaps some other types of pes ticide containers) \u2013 are designed specifically to disperse \nchemical products.  It is not uncommon for aerosol containers to have on the outside dried \nsplatters or drips of the chemical products they dispersed during use ( e.g., due to failure to shake \nthe cans properly prior to use, overspray in a confined area, backspray in a windy area, a \ndefective nozzle, or sputtering as the aerosol can neared the end of its useful life).  However, \nregulators or inspectors could potentially view such splatters or drips as \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage\u201d making the cans ineligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nIn addition, in the absence of certainty about how the splatters/drips will be viewed be regulators \nor inspectors, some generators/hand lers might conservatively assume that all aerosol cans \nbearing these marks should be handled as full y regulated  (non-universal) hazardous wastes.  \nBecause many, if not most, used cans will have such splatters/drips, the universal waste rule for \naerosol can s could effectively become unusable, thereby  undermining all the potential benefits of \nthe proposed rule . \n \nSimilar issues would arise in a variety of other situations.  Aerosol cans that are fully intact may \nnevertheless show evidence of corrosion \u2013 especi ally if the chemical products they contained and \ndispersed are corrosive ( e.g., certain cleaning products) and/or if they are stored for extended \nperiods in damp conditions.  Aerosol cans may also have missing actuator buttons, for a variety \nof reasons tha t have nothing to do with their basic structural integrity, such as that the actuators \nmay have fallen off ( e.g., if they were not attached correctly to begin with), they may have \ninadvertently been knocked off during handling or use, or they may have been  intentionally \nremoved ( e.g., under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(2)(iii) and 273.33(e)(2)(iii), which authorize \n                                                 \n14  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,666 (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(1) and 273.33(e)(1)) \n(proposing to require han dlers to accumulate universal waste aerosol cans \u201cin a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d).   \n \n15  Further protections for leaking/damage d aerosols are also provided by other regulatory regimes, such as the \nDOT hazardous materials transport regulations and local fire codes (as discussed generally in Section 4 above in the \ncontext of Criterion #5).  For example, the DOT rules require that ae rosols that are damaged, defective, or leaking to \nthe point where they do not meet applicable design standards must be transported in special aerosol salvage drums \nmarked \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE\u201d or \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE DRUM.\u201d  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(k)(2).  Inasmuch \nas DOT has determined that such salvage drums are protective during transport (including storage incidental to \ntransport), there is no reason to exclude these aerosol cans from the universal waste rule.           \n \n- 19 - \n \n \nhandlers to \u201c[r]emov[e] actuators to reduce the risk of accidental release \u201d).  In addition, intact \naerosols may be dented or scratched (more so than ot her universal wastes, like lamps which \nwould generally break rather dent, or batteries that do not have a gas -filled cavity and are more \nsolid/dense).  Any one of these conditions could potentially be viewed as \u201c leakage, spillage, or \ndamage \u201d under the prop osed rule, which might prevent the aerosol cans from being managed as \nuniversal wastes.  In this way, EPA\u2019s proposed exclusion has the potential to become the \nexclusion that swallows the entire rule.  \n \n 5.3 Exclusion for Empty Aerosols    \n \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that meet the standard for empty containers.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,66 5  \n(proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3) ).  EPA explains in the preamble that \u201c[a]n \naerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR 261.7 is not subject to \nhazardous waste regulation, and may be recycled as scrap metal.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  The Agency \nstates that the exclusion  applies to  \u201caerosol cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product).\u201d  Id.  The Retail Associations  have several concerns with this part of the \nproposal.  \n \nFirst, even though EPA states in the preamble that empty aerosol cans are \u201cnot subject to \nhazardous waste regulation,\u201d th e Agency in the past has indicated that empty aerosols might \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity and thus remain subject to hazardous waste regulation.  See \nEPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) (Attachment 12) \n(\u201cIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the aerosol cans [may] be a RCRA hazardous waste \nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  As discussed in Section 8  \nbelow, we do not believe that any aerosol cans \u2013 much less emp ty aerosol cans \u2013 qualify as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  However, if any empty aerosols are deemed to be reactive, the \nexclusion of empty cans from the universal waste rule could potentially be interpreted to mean \nthat such \u201creactive\u201d empty cans would have  to be managed as full y regulated (non-universal) \nhazardous wastes.16  Such a result would make no sense, given that full or partially full aerosol \n                                                 \n16  We note that t here is some uncertainty with respect to this point, because of the confusing way that the \nexclusions in proposed 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b) are structured.  That provision states that the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rule do not apply to aerosol cans tha t (1) are not wastes, (2) are non -hazardous, (3) are empty, or (4) \nshow evidence of leakage, spillage or damage.  It is our understanding that for the first two categories ( i.e., aerosol \ncans that are not waste or are non -hazardous), EPA\u2019s intent is that g enerators would not be required  to handle the \ncans as universal wastes, but would allowed  to do so (or to handle the cans completely outside the RCRA regulatory \nprogram).  On the other hand, for the last category ( i.e., cans with evidence of leaking or dam age), the Agency\u2019s \nintent apparently is that generators would be prohibited  from handling the cans as universal wastes (and would have \nto handle them as fully regulated hazardous wastes, assuming they are solid and hazardous wastes).  Thus, the \n\u201cexclusions \u201d for these categories apparently are intended to mean very different things.   \n \nFor aerosol cans that are empty and non -reactive (which, as noted above, we believe would include all empty cans), \nEPA presumably intends the exclusion to operate in the same manner as for the first two categories, i.e., to mean \nthat generators are not required  to handle the cans as universal wastes, but are allowed  to do so (or to handle the \ncans completely outside the RCRA regulatory program).  However, to the extent EPA may believe that any empty \naerosol cans are reactive (which, as noted above, we do not believe is the case), it seems unlikely that the Agency \nwould intend the exclusion to work the same way (since that would allow \u201creactive\u201d empty cans to be managed \n \n- 20 - \n \n \ncans exhibiting the reactivity characteristic (to the extent that any such cans might be deemed by \nEPA to be reactive) would be eligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nMoreover, if \u201creactive\u201d empty aerosol cans cannot be managed as universal wastes, retailers and \nother generators would have to identify and segregate such cans so that the rest cou ld be \nmanaged as universal wastes \u2013 an almost impossible task, especially given the lack of clarity \nabout what constitutes an empty aerosol and/or a reactive aerosol, as well as the generally limited \nexperience and high turnover of personnel in the retail sector.    \n \nWe doubt that EPA intended such results from its proposed exclusion of empty aerosols.  \nPerhaps the Agency intended its statement in the preamble that empty aerosols are \u201cnot subject \nto hazardous waste regulation\u201d to clarify that empty container s are not subject to regulation as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  If so, we support such a clarification, but ask EPA to make this point \nmore explicit, so as to avoid any potential confusion.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the \n1987 EPA guidance refe renced above did not actually conclude  that empty aerosols could be \nreactive, but rather responded to a question that was posed to the Agency assum ing that they \ncould be reactive.  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) \n(Attachm ent 12) (\u201c[W]ould aerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still  potentially reactive \nbecause of contained  propellant be  regulated as hazardous waste?\u201d).   Thus, a statement now that \nempty aerosol cans are not reactive would not actually reverse prior EPA guidance.  And, as \ndiscussed in Section 8  below, it would be supported by the fact that even full or partially full \naerosols are not properly viewed as reactive.   \n \nA second problem with EPA\u2019s proposal on empty aerosol cans is that it provides no clear \nstandard for when an aerosol can qualifies as empty such that it would be excluded from the \nuniversal waste rule.  The proposed regulatory exclusion covers \u201c[a]erosol c ans that meet the \nstandard for empty containers  under part [sic] 261.7.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,665  (proposed to \nbe codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3)) ; see also id . at 11,660 (addressing \u201c aerosol can [s] that \nmeet [ ] the definition of empty container in  40 CFR 261.7 \u201d).  However, EPA has long side -\nstepped the issue of when aerosol cans qualify as empty under Section 261.7, leaving generators \nwithout any meaningful standard to apply.17   \n \n                                                 \ncompletel y outside the RCRA regulatory program).  For these aerosol cans, EPA might intend the exclusion to \noperate in the same way as the exclusion for damaged/leaking aerosol cans, such that the \u201creactive\u201d empty cans \nwould have to be managed as fully regulated ha zardous wastes, rather than as universal wastes.  This is the potential \ninterpretation discussed in the main text above.  However, it is possible that EPA may intend the exclusion for \n\u201creactive\u201d empty cans to operate in yet a third (unspecified) way.         \n     \n17  See, e.g. , Letter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to John DiFazio, \nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11780)  (\u201cDenit Letter #1) \n(Attachment 13) (\u201cWe have \u2026 been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of \n\u2018empty\u2019 under 40 CFR 261.7.  \u2026 [I]f the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to determine whether they \nare \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria listed in 40 CF R 261.7. \u2026 However, in order to dispose of a can as non -hazardous \nwaste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to determine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7\u201d); \nLetter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Gregory L. Crawford, Vice President, \nRecycling Operations, Steel Recycling Institute (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11782) (\u201cDenit Letter #2) \n(Attachment 14) (same).   \n \n \n- 21 - \n \n \nMoreover, the preamble to the proposed rule further muddies an alread y muddy picture by \nintroducing a new standard for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans and conflating it with a standard previously \noffered by the Agency for entirely different purposes.  In particular, EPA states in the preamble \nthat the proposed exclusion covers \u201caeroso l cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product),\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660, even though this standard is not in the \nproposed regulatory text, has no precedent we are aware of, and leaves unanswered what it \nmeans to be emptie d of propellant and product.  In addition, EPA states in the preamble that \nempty aerosol cans as defined under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7 \u201cmay be recycled as scrap metal,\u201d even \nthough past Agency guidance states that the standard for recycling aerosol cans as scrap metal is \nwhether they \u201c contain a significant amount of  liquid ,\u201d not whether they meet the standard of \nempty in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7.  See, e.g. , Denit Letter #1 (\u201cif the [aerosol] cans are being recycled, \nit is not necessary to determine whether they are \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria in 40 CFR 261.7.  As \nlong as an aerosol can being recycled does not contain significant liquids, t he can is exempt as \nscrap metal\u201d); Denit Letter #2 (same).  Complicating matters even further, EPA has previously \nstated that one way  to ensure an aerosol can does not contain a significant amount of liquid is by \npuncturing and draining it, id., which  has left the misimpression in the minds of some  that this is \nthe only way  to achieve this standard.  And, by blurring the distinction between th e \u201cno \nsignificant liquids\u201d standard and the definition of empty container, EPA may be leaving the \nmisimpression that  the only way to render an aerosol can empty is by puncturing and draining it.   \n \nIn light of the above, the Retail Associations urge EPA to clarify that empty aerosol cans are not \nreactive and thus do not have to be managed as either universal or hazardou s wastes (although \nthey may be managed as universal wastes on a voluntary basis), and further to clarify when \naerosol cans qualify as empty (including, but not limited to the fact that emptying does not \nrequire puncturing and draining).   We elaborate furth er on the guidance needed on these and \nrelated issues in Section 8 below.  \n \n6. EPA Should Clarify That As Soon As It Finalizes the Proposed Rule, Aerosol Can \nWastes May Be Transported in All States Without a Hazardous Waste Manifest or \na Hazardous Waste Transporter  \n \nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA indicates that the designation of hazardous aerosol can \nwastes as universal wastes under the federal regulations would not take effect in authorized states \nunless and until such states adopted the same de signation under state law.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at \n11,662 -63.  Moreover, because such designation would generally make the state programs less \nstringent  than they currently are  (except in the case of the few states that already designate \naerosol cans as unive rsal wastes), the states \u201cwould not have to adopt the universal waste \nregulations for aerosol cans.\u201d  Id. at 11,663.  These statements leave open the possibility that \nsome states may never adopt the universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and/or that there may be \nan extended period of time during which there will be a patchwork of regulation for aerosol \ncans.18 \n                                                 \n18  To minimize this patchwork and fully realize the benefits of a universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, we ask EPA to encourage states to quickly adopt the new rule, as the Agency has done for previous \nuniversal waste rules.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,53 6 (May 11, 1995) (final original universal waste rule)  \n(\u201cEven though States are not required to adopt today\u2019s rule, EPA strongly encourages them to do so\u201d) ; 64 Fed. Reg. \n \n- 22 - \n \n \n \nThe proposed rule does not address how this patchwork will work.  However, this issue is of \nvital importance, especially to retailers and other gener ators that may be generating hazardous \naerosol can wastes in multiple states, to persons developing/operating national or regional \ncollection and recycling/disposal programs for aerosol can wastes , and to generators and \ntransporters moving aerosol cans across state lines to appropriate destination facilities .  Of \nparticular importance are the requirements (if any) that may apply to the transport of such wastes \nfrom, to, or through states that have not yet (or never will) classify aerosol cans as universa l \nwastes.  \n \nAs discussed below, EPA has previously addressed essentially the same issue in the context of \nother universal waste rules.  However, when it has done so, it has ignored relevant law and the \nAgency\u2019s own guidance, and arrived at a conclusion that  inappropriately and unnecessarily \nundermined implementation of the universal waste rule.  The Retail Associations urge the \nAgency to rectify the situation by clarifying, once and for all, that once a waste is designated as a \nuniversal waste under federal law, the waste may be transported nationwide without a hazardous \nwaste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  \n \nIn prior universal waste rulemakings, EPA has stated that federally designated universal wastes \nremain subject to full hazardous waste regula tion as long as they are in states that have not (yet) \nadopted the federal universal waste rule, with the result being that transport from, through, or to \nsuch a state must be performed by a hazardous waste transporter and must be accompanied by a \nhazardou s waste manifest.19  However, these statements overlook ed the fact that federal rules for \ntransportation of hazardous materials (including hazardous wastes) generally preempt state rules \nthat are more stringent.   \n \n                                                 \n36,466, 36,4 72 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps)  (\u201cEPA hopes to encourage  \u2026 states to regulate \nspent lamps  as universal waste an d therefore  promote greater consistency in  regulatory approaches across state  \nborders \u201d); 70 Fed.

See, e.g. , Memorandum \nfrom Steve Herman, Assistant Administrator, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Ass urance, EPA, and Elliott P. \nLaws, Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA, to EPA Regional \nAdministrators (April 10, 1996) (RCRA Online #11960) (Attachment 15) (\u201cBy finalizing 40 C.F.R.

Reg. 25,492, 25,537 -38 (May 11, 1995) (final  original universal waste rule); 64 Fed. Reg. \n36,466, 36,482 -83 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps); 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,516 -17 (August 5 , \n2005) (final universal waste rule for mercury -containing equipment).   \n \n \n- 23 - \n \n \nEPA itself has previously noted  the preemp tive effect of federal rules for transport of hazardous \nwastes, stating for example that  \u201c[even though] p reemption authorities are quite foreign to \nRCRA [ they] are introduced into the transporter arena by the statutory directive in RCRA to \nmain tain consist ency with the DOT framework [for transportation of hazardous materials  under \nthe Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (\u201cHMTA\u201d) ].\u201d20  Indeed, e ven state hazardous waste \ntransport requirements that have been authorized by EPA pursuant to RCRA are not immune  to \npre-emption under the HMTA.21   \n \nIn the present case, if  hazardous aerosol can wastes are classified as universal wastes, any state \nrules requiring such items to be shipped as ordinary hazardous wastes would be preempted.  \nConsider, for example, the req uirement that hazardous wastes be transported with a manifest.  \nUnder EPA\u2019s proposed rule, hazardous aerosol can wastes would not have to be shipped with a \nmanifest for purposes of federal law.  The HMTA explicitly provides that state shipping paper \nrequir ements (including manifest requirements) are preempted if they are not \u201csubstantively the \nsame\u201d as the corresponding federal requirements.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5125(b)(1)(C).

Thus, any state manifest \nrequirements for aerosol cans  would clearly be preempted.  \n \nAs EPA itself stated in 1984, federal law \u201cprohibit[s] States from requiring separate State \nmanifests or other information to accompany  waste shipments  [if such documents or information \nare not required by federal law] .\u201d22  DOT echoed these statements in its own 1984 not ice, saying \nthat \u201cno carrier could be required to carry  any State manifest form that differs from the EPA \n                                                 \n20  See Letter from Mich ael Shapiro, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Richard J.

As in the case of state manifest requiremen ts, state rules governing packaging, \nlabeling, or release reporting during transportation are explicitly preempted if they differ in any \nrespect from the federal rules.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  5125(b)(1)(B), (D).  State rules for licensing or \nregistration of tra nsporters are also preempted if they operate as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the goals of the \nfederal hazardous materials law.26  Of course, state rules related to handling of aerosol cans at \nstationary facilities will generally not be preempted, because they do not in volve transportation .27       \n \nThe Retail Associations recognize that EPA may be inclined to defer on the issue of preemption \nto the department that is responsible for implementing the federal hazardous materials \ntransportation law (i.e., DOT).  However, EPA\u2019s prior statements on interstate transport  of \nuniversal wastes have sufficiently clouded the issue that it is now essential that the Agency set \nthe record straight (in consultation with DOT, if necessary).  EPA, in fact, has been willing to do \nso in the past.28  The Agency should be eager to do so in the current case, because preemption \nwill significantly advance the goal of facilitating nationwide recycling of aerosol cans .  At a \nminimum, EPA should disavow the statements in prior universal waste rules, a nd clarify that \nthey were not intended to represent determinations that state rules requiring hazardous waste \nmanifests or hazardous waste transporters were not preempted.    \n                                                 \n23  See 49 Fed.

Reg. 62,527, 62,53 7-38 (December 6, 1995) (New York regulations requiring additional \nmanifest information are preempted, because there are no corresponding federal requirements); 58 Fed.

Harmon , 951 F.2d 1571 (10th Cir. \n1991) (Colorado permit requirements for hazardous material transporters are preempted  because they are an obstacle \nto the congressional goal of promoting safety through uniform standards).   \n \n27  One possible exception relates to loading, unloading, and storage activities that are incidental to \ntransportation.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 61,906, 61,9 38 (October 30, 2003) (revising 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.1(c) to clarify that \ntransportation includes loading, unloading, and storage incidental to transportation) and 61,923 -24 (explaining that \nstate and local requirements related to these activities may be preemp ted). \n \n28  See, e.g.,  49 Fed. Reg. at 10,495 (\u201cStates through which hazardous waste shipments pass are not allowed to \nplace additional information requirements on the transporter as a condition of transportation.\u201d); RCRA/CERCLA \nHotline Report (May 1985) (RC RA Online #12399)  (Attachment 19) (\u201cStates through which [a] waste shipment \ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements.\u201d).   \n \n- 25 - \n \n \n \nFinally, the Retail Associations recognize that EPA may also be reluctant to add ress the \npreemption issue due to concerns about the potential reactions of state regulatory agencies.  \nAlthough such agencies may generally be protective of their sovereign authority, we believe that, \nin the present case, they generally recognize the benefits of uniform national regulations for \nhazardous aerosol can wastes.  Indeed, they may welcome preemption as important step forward \nin meeting recycling goals for such wastes .  Moreover, EPA would not be establishing new law \nby addressi ng the preemption issue.  Rather, it would simply be recognizing that, under existing \nlaw, the effect of the new federal universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol can wastes would be \nto preempt more stringent state rules for transportation of such wastes . \n \n7. EPA\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis Dramatically Underestimates the Potential Cost \nSavings That Would Be Achieved Under the Universal Waste Rule   \n \nIn the Regulatory Impact Analysis (\u201cRIA\u201d) for the proposed rule, EPA\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d analysis \nestimates that the costs savings associated with the proposal would be only $3.0 to $3.5 million \nper year.  See RIA at 24.  The Agency also includes an \u201calternative\u201d analysis in an appendix, \nwhich results in an estimate of $56.7 to $63.3 million per year, but discounts this analysis by \nsaying that \u201cthe analysis presented in this appendix \u2026 may overestimate cost savings.\u201d  Id. at 48 -\n49.  As discussed below, EPA\u2019s primar y analysis dramatically underestimates the likely cost \nsavings, in part because it fails to take into account the unique characteristics of affected \nfacilities in the retail sector, which the Agency itself acknowledges represent about two -thirds of \nthe uni verse of affected hazardous waste generators.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Indeed, even \nEPA\u2019s alternative analysis likely understates the cost savings significantly.  \n \nThroughout the RIA, EPA notes that the \u201ccost savings [under the proposal] are largely \nattributable to facilities changing generator status as a result of no longer having to count aerosol \ncans towards their HW [hazardous waste] generator status.\u201d  See RIA at ES -4, 24, and 47.  The \nRetail Associations  agree, but take issue with the Agency\u2019s es timates of the number of facilities \nexpected to change generator status, especially under the primary analysis.  According to that \nanalysis, only about 500 facilities nationwide across all industries would change generator status \nunder the proposal, repres enting less than 0.8% of the aerosol -generating L arge Quantity \nGenerator (\u201cL QG\u201d) universe and 3.7% of the aerosol -generating S mall Quantity Generator \n(\u201cSQG\u201d) universe.  Id. at ES -4 and 19.  However, these figures seem extremely  low.  Some \nindividual retail  companies are likely to have more than 500 facilities  change generator status as \na result of a universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and the number across the entire retail sector \nwould clearly be many times that figure (not even counting the number of f acilities in other \nindustries).  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Retail Associations and the retail sector as a \nwhole ha ve been urging the Agency so strongly over the last several years to classify and \nregulate aerosol cans as universal wastes.  \n \nBased on our review of the RIA, we believe there are three main sources of EPA\u2019s error, each of \nwhich is discussed briefly below:  \n \n \n- 26 - \n \n \no Use of  SQG  Data Skewed Heavily to the Manufacturing Sector .  EPA apparently \nestimated the percentage of SQGs that would become  VSQGs under the proposal by \nreviewing the admittedly very limited data on SQGs in its 2015 Biennial Report (\u201cBR\u201d) \ndatabase, and determining for each SQG facility in that database how the exclusion of \naerosol cans from counting toward the SQG threshold mig ht affect the status of the \nfacility.  See RIA at 18 (explaining the methodology) and 8 (explaining that the BR \ndatabase is a \u201csignificant underrepresentation\u201d of the SQG universe, because \u201conly LQGs \nare required to make BR submissions\u201d).  However, the BR data on SQGs are heavily \nskewed toward the manufacturing sector.  Only 8% of the aerosol -generating SQGs in the \nBR database are from the retail sector, even though EPA itself acknowledges that the \nsector represents fully 65% of the aerosol -generating unive rse.29  In contrast, almost half \nof the aerosol -generating SQGs in the BR database are in the manufacturing sector.   See \nRIA at 7.   \n \n In light of the above, EPA\u2019s estimate of the percentage of SQGs that would become \nVSQGs under the proposal  is based primarily on manufacturing facilities, even though \nretail stores represent by far a greater number of affected facilities and have \ncharacteristics that make it far more likely that they will change generator status.  \nMember s of the Retail Associa tions  have reported that aerosol cans frequently account \nfor 50% (by weight) or even more of all the potentially hazardous unsold/returned \nproducts handled by retailers.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 16.  We \nsuspect that few, if any, manufactur ing facilities would have such a high proportion of \naerosol can wastes.  Moreover, given the fundamental difference s in the operations of \nretail stores and manufacturing facilities, we suspect that retail stores in the SQG \ncategory are much more likely to generate waste quantities only slightly above the SQG \nthreshold and/or to exceed that threshold only on an episodic basis.  Taken together, these \ncharacteristics make it much more likely that SQG retail stores would become VSQGs \nunder a universal waste rul e for aerosols.30   \n \nBy basing its estimate of the effects primarily on facilities in the manufacturing sector \n(and in other sectors that likewise are substantially different from the retail sector that \nrepresents the bulk of affected generators), EPA has d ramatically understated the \npercentage of SQGs that would become VSQGs under the proposal .  The effects of this \nerror on the bottom -line estimate of cost savings are very substantial.  EPA\u2019s alternative \nanalysis estimates that approximately 80% of aerosol -generating SQGs will become \nVSQGs under the proposal.  See RIA at 48.  That figure seems much closer to reality, and \n                                                 \n29  See RIA at 7 (indicating that the BR database has only 59 aerosol -generating SQG retail facilities out of a \ntotal 710 aerosol -generating SQG facilities across all industries, which corresponds to 8%); 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655 \n(\u201c[the] top economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the largest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade \nindustry \u2026 representing 65% of the affect ed \u2026 universe\u201d).   \n \n30  See, e.g. , Retail Associations NODA Comments at 24, n.26 (\u201cSeveral members of the Retail Associations \n\u2026 estimate that well over half  of their stores would be reclassified as CESQGs if all aerosols were exempted from \n\u2018counting\u2019 for purposes of determining generator status [as would be the case under the universal waste rule]\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  \n \n \n- 27 - \n \n \nby EPA\u2019s estimates would increase the annual cost savings from the $3.0 -$3.5 million \nrange to the $56.7 -$63.3 million  range.  \n \no Failure to  Account for Expected Change in the Status of Large Numbers of Retail \nLQG Facilities under the Upcoming Rule on Low-Concentration Nicotine Products.   \nAs noted above, EPA\u2019s primary analysis projects that only a handful of the estimated \n6520 aerosol -generati ng LQG facilities in the country will change generator status as a \nresult of the proposed rule.   See RIA at ES -4 and 19.   In fact, however, it is likely that \nlarge numbers of these facilities will change status under the universal waste rule for \naerosols.  The reason is that the vast majority of these LQGs (4 ,225, according to EPA\u2019s \nprimary estimate) are retail stores, see id . at 7,  and we believe that most of these facilities \nare LQGs only because they generate more than 1 kg of low -concentration nicotine \nproducts ( e.g., nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, prescription liquids, and e -cigarettes), \nwhich are currently classified as acutely hazardous wastes under RCRA.31  EPA has \nproposed to reclassify these products as non -acutely hazardous wastes or to exclude t hem \nfrom RCRA regulation, either one of which would likely cause many of these facilities to \nbe reclassified as SQGs.   See 80 Fed. Reg. at 58,071 -73.  Like other SQG retail facilities, \nthese newly -SQG retail facilities would be highly likely to change to V SQG facilities \nunder the universal waste rule for aerosols.   \n \n If these newly -SQG retail facilities are included in the analysis, the effects on the  bottom -\nline estimate of cost savings would be substantial.   EPA has estimated that the annual \ncost savings  per facility of changing from an SQG to a VSQG would be $3600 to $3800 \n(assuming that virtually all of these facilities will be Small Quantity Handlers of \nUniversal Wastes (\u201cSQHUWs\u201d)).  See RIA at 25.  Thus, if there are 3,000 newly -SQG \nretail facilities that would become VSQGs as a result of the universal waste rule for \naerosols,32 the total annual cost savings for these facilities alone would be $10.8 to $11.4 \nmillion \u2013 a few times EPA\u2019s primary estimate of the annual cost savings for the entire \ncountry .  Assuming EPA finalizes its rule on low -concentration nicotine products before \nit finalizes the proposed universal waste rule for aerosols, it should revise its RIA to \naccount for these substantial additional savings.  \n \no Underestimate of Baseline Numbers o f LQG and SQG Facilities Generating Aerosol \nWastes.   EPA\u2019s primary analysis in the RIA estimates that there are currently 6,520 \nLQGs and 13,019 SQGs that generate aerosol can wastes, while the Agency\u2019s alternative \n                                                 \n31  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.33(e) (EPA Hazardo us Waste No. P075) (acute hazardous waste listing for nicotine); \n80 Fed. Reg. 58,014, 58,017 (September 25, 2015) (\u201cunused nicotine patches, gums and lozenges are finished \ndosage forms of nicotine and therefore are regulated as P075 when discarded\u201d); Retai l Associations NODA \nComments at 9 (stating that \u201cMembers of the Retail Associations report that low -[concentration] nicotine products \nare the sole reason why the vast majority of stores handling such products are classified as LQGs\u201d and estimating \nthe numb ers of such facilities in the several thousands).   \n \n32  This figure corresponds to approximately 70% of the 4,225 aerosol -generating retail industry LQGs \nidentified by EPA in its primary analysis.  We note that even if the actual percentage of retail LQGs that would be \naffected in this way is lower than 70%, the 3,000 facility figure may be reasonable, given that EPA\u2019s baseline figure \nof 4,225 retail LQGs generating hazardous aerosol can wastes is probably far too low (as discussed further below).   \n \n- 28 - \n \n \nanalysis estimates the figures at 7,239 an d 14,454, respectively.  See RIA at 19 and 48.  \nThe Retail Associations  believe that these baseline numbers are likely all too low.  With \nrespect to LQGs, the 2013 BR data showed a total of 20,771 LQGs.  See EPA, \n\u201cRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potent ial Costs, Benefits, and Other Impacts of the \nFinal Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule \u201d (September 2016) (\u201cGenerator \nRule RIA\u201d)  (Attachment 20), Exhibit 2 -6.  It seems likely that virtually all of these LQGs \ngenerate at least some aerosol can wast es, if nothing else from cleaning offices and \nbathrooms.  Yet, the current RIA estimates suggest that only about one -third of these \nLQGs generate any aerosol can wastes.  Focusing just on the retail sector, the 2013 BR \ndata showed 5,563 LQGs in the industr y, virtually all in retail categories, such as health \nand personal care stores, that can almost invariably be expected to sell aerosol products \n(and thus to generate significant quantities of aerosol wastes).  Id.  Yet, the current RIA \nestimates that only 4,225 retail LQGs generate aerosol wastes.   \n \n The apparent underestimates are magnified in the RIA, since EPA bases its estimates of \naerosol -generating SQGs on its estimates of aerosol -generating LQGs.  In particular, \nEPA arrived at its SQG estimates by m ultiplying the LQG estimates by a factor of two \n(2.0).  See RIA at 8 -9.  However, there are several reasons to question this methodology.  \nFirst, as noted above, the underlying estimates of the number of aerosol -generating LQGs \nseem low.  Second, in the RI A for the 2016 hazardous waste generator rule, EPA \nestimated that the ratio of SQGs to LQGs was significantly higher, namely between 2.4 \nand 3.1.  See Generator Rule RIA, Exhibit ES -2.  Although these ratios were not focused \nspecifically on aerosol -generat ing generators, there is no apparent reason why the ratios \nwould be significantly different for such generators, as opposed to generators of \nhazardous wastes as a whole.  Third, EPA based its factor of 2.0 on data from just 3 \nstates, and for one of those s tates, the Agency acknowledged that it had to use indirect \n(and probably incomplete) means to identify the relevant facilities.  See RIA at 8.  Fourth, \nEPA in the 2014 NODA estimated that the number of SQGs in the retail sector alone was \n16,774 (virtually all of which would be expected t o generate significant quantities of \naerosol wastes) , which is substantially greater than the number of SQGs that EPA is now \nestimating for all industries  (i.e., 13,019 under the primary analysis, and 14,454 under the \naltern ative analysis) .  See RIA at ES -4 and 19 (estimate from the primary analysis) and \n48 (estimate from the alternative analysis); 79 Fed. Reg. 8,926, 8,932 (February 14, \n2014) (NODA estimate).     \n \n These deviations raise serious questions about EPA\u2019s methodo logy, and suggest that the \nbaseline estimates of the affected universe of generators \u2013 and therefore the ultimate \nestimate of the costs savings \u2013 are substantially too low.  As noted above, even a \nrelatively modest increase in the number of generators whos e status would change under \nthe universal waste rule could increase the expected cost savings by millions of dollars \neach year.  \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above, the Retail Associations  believe that EPA has dramatically \nunderestimated the likely cos t savings that would result from a universal waste rule for aerosol \n \n- 29 - \n \n \ncans.  Adding up all the estimates discussed above, we believe that the total cost savings will \nlikely be at least $80 million per year, and potentially significantly higher.        \n \n8. EPA Should Follow Through on Its Commitment to Issue Guidance on the Extent to \nWhich Aerosol Cans Are Subject to RCRA Regulation in the First Instance  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  believe that EPA\u2019s proposal to classify and regulate hazardous \naerosol can wastes as universal wastes is a major step forward in improving the regulatory \nframework for such materials, we also believe it is imperative for the Agency issue guidance on \nwhen aerosol cans qualify as solid and hazardous wastes, and are subject to R CRA regulation, in \nthe first instance.  Since a t least as far back as 2014, the Retail Associations have stressed that an \neffective strategy for aerosol cans requires not only a universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, but also new guidance o n these fundamental issues.  See, e.g. , Retail Associations \nNODA Comments at 20 -25.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , underscored the importance \nof guidance (as well as a universal waste rule) in its 2017 comments on EPA\u2019s regulatory reform \nefforts under Executive Order 13777.  See RILA Regulatory Reform Comments at 8-12.  In its \n2016 Retail Strategy, EPA acknowledged the need for additional guidance, committing, for \nexample, to develop a \u201cguide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subti tle C \nrecycling exclusions .\u201d  See EPA , \u201cStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA\u2019s \nRegulatory Framework \u201d (September 12, 2016) (Attachment 27)  at 6.  We urge EPA to follow \nthrough on this commitment, and would welcome the opportunity to assist the Agency in this \neffort.   EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste \nrule, if that can be done without dela ying the universal waste rule.  However, the first priority \nshould be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be \nfollowed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.   \n \nWe believe that guidance is needed on four main issues , each of which is discussed briefly \nbelow:  \n \no Applicability of the Definition of Solid Waste to Aerosol Cans Destined for \nReclamation .  EPA should clarify that aerosol cans (whether full, partially full, or empty) \nare not solid wastes when th ey are destined for reclamation ( e.g., recovery of metals in \nthe housing of the dispenser, useful propellants such as hydrocarbons suitable for use as \nfuel, and/or the chemical products originally intended t o be dispensed).  The Agency has \nlong stated that  aerosol cans, as well as the propellants and chemical products inside, are \n\u201ccommercial chemical products.\u201d33  As commercial chemical products, the aerosol cans \n                                                 \n33  See, e.g., Memorandum from Sylvia K. Lowrance, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Karl E.  \nBremer, Chief, RCRA Permitting Branch, EPA Region 5 (December 30, 1992) (RCRA Online #11717)  (\u201cLowrance \nMemorandum\u201d) (Attachment 21) (\u201cthe remaining propellants in  the cans [are] unused \u2026 [and] would be classified \nas commercial chemical products\u201d ); id.

EPA has long suggested that waste aerosol cans, \nwhether full or empty,  have the potential to qualify as reactive hazardous wastes on the \nbasis that they are \u201ccapable of detonation or explosive reaction if [they are] subjected to a \nstrong initiating source or if heated under confinement.\u201d37  However, as the Retail \nAssociations  have demonstrated, aerosol cans do not, in fact, exhibit the reactivity \ncharacteristic.  See generally  Retail Associations NODA Comments at 20 -23.   \n \n                                                 \n \n34  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(3) (listed commercial chemical products  are not solid wastes when destined for \nreclamation ); 50 Fed. Reg. 14,216, 14,219 (April 11, 1985) (specifying that the ru les for listed commercial chemical \nproducts also apply to characteristic commercial chemical products) ; see also  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1(c)(4)  (defining \nreclamation to include \u201cprocess[ing] to recover a usable product\u201d ). \n \n35  See, e.g. , 73 Fed.

As the Retail \nAssociations explained in detail in comments on the 2014 NODA, none of the components of these products are \nsubject to RCRA regulation.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 23 -25.  The chemical product intended to \nbe dispensed in this situation  is non -hazardous, and thus clearly not a RCRA hazardous waste.  The metal housing \nlikewise is non -hazardous (and would be excluded or exempt from regulation if it were also reclaimed).  Moreover, \nEPA has clearly stated that the only remaining component \u2013 the propellant \u2013 would not be a solid waste.  See \nLowrance Memorandum  (Attachment 21) (\u201cSince [butane and propane propellants] are fuels and being burned for \nenergy recovery, they would not fall within the definition of a solid waste and would consequentl y not be considered \nhazardous wastes\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(2)(ii) (commercial chemicals products destined to be used as fuels or to \nmake fuels \u201care not solid wastes if they are themselves fuels\u201d).  Inasmuch as none of the components would be solid \nor haz ardous wastes, the aerosol cans would also not be subject to RCRA regulation.  \n \n37  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027)  (Attachment 12) (\u201cIrrespective \nof the lack of contained waste, \u2026 aerosol cans [c]ould be a RCRA hazardous w aste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.23(a)(6) (supposedly relevant part of the definition of \nreactivity).   \n \n \n- 31 - \n \n \n In general, DOT requirements for the design, manufacture, and testing of aerosol cans \nensure that the pr oducts will not burst \u2013 much less explode or detonate \u2013 when heated to \nthe types of temperatures contemplated by the RCRA reactivity characteristic ( e.g., 140\u00b0F \nor 160\u00b0F), or when subjected to the types of initiating sources contemplated by the \ncharacteris tic (e.g., jostling, bumping, tipping, and dropping).38  Moreover, EPA has long \nstated that the reactivity characteristic is intended to capture only a \u201cfairly narrow \ncategory of wastes\u201d that are \u201cclearly\u201d hazardous, even \u201cto the generator\u2019s own \noperations. \u201d39  Aerosol cans do not exhibit any of these indicia of reactivity, given that \nthey are ubiquitously generated and EPA itself has expressed uncertainty about when \naerosol s might be reactive.40  Thus, we urge EPA to issue guidance cla rifying that aerosol \ncans do not exhibit the RCRA characteristic of reactivity.             \n \no Point at Which Aerosol Cans Are \u201cEmpty.\u201d    As EPA noted in the preamble to the \nproposed rule, \u201c[a]n aerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR \n261.7 is not subject to hazardous waste regulation.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660.   \nHowever, it is unclear under the referenced definition when aerosol cans qualify as \nempty.  For this  reason, we urge EPA to provide  guidance on this issue.  In general, we \nbelieve such guidance must provide a practical means for generators to determine when \naerosol cans are empty, recognizing that aerosols are used and/or generated as wastes in \nan extrao rdinarily wide range of circumstances by persons of widely ranging degrees of \nknowledge and experience with hazardous wastes , and that aerosol cans are closed and \nopaque units that prevent direct observation of the contents and limit direct access to the \ncontents.  \n \n                                                 \n38  See, e.g. , 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(ii) (requiring metal aerosol cans to be \u201ccapable of withstanding without \nbursting a pressure of one and one -half times  the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 130\u00b0F\u201d (emphasis added)); \n\u00a7 173.24(b)(1) (requiring all packagings, including aerosol cans, to be \u201cdesigned, constructed, maintained, filled, \n[their] contents so limited, and closed, so that under conditions normally incident to transportation \u2026 there will be \nno identifiable \u2026 release of hazardous materials to the environment\u201d); Memorandum from John J. Skinner, \nDirector, Office of Solid Waste, EPA,  to David Wagoner, Director, Air & Waste Management Division, EPA \nRegion VIII (November 30, 1984) (RCRA Online #12339) (Attachment 23) (concluding that small caliber \nammunition up to 0.50 caliber are not reactive, based on tests showing that they do not de tonate or explode at 160\u00b0F \nor when subjected to \u201cdrop tests \u2026 to simulate handling errors\u201d).  \n \n39  See EPA, \u201cBackground Document : Reactivity  Characteristic\u201d  (May 1980)  (Attachment 24) at 10 (\u201cthe \nproblems posed by reactive wastes appear to be confined to a f airly narrow category of wastes\u201d); 51 Fed. Reg. \n21,648, 21,649 (June 13, 1986) (\u201ccharacteristics define broad classes of wastes that are clearly hazardous\u201d \n(emphasis added)); 45 Fed. Reg. 33,084 , 33,110 (May 19, 1980) (\u201c[m]ost generators of reactive wastes  are aware \nthat their wastes possess this property \u2026 because such wastes are dangerous to the generators\u2019 own operations\u201d).   \n \n40  See, e.g. , Letter from Elizabeth A. Cotsworth, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to T.L. \nNebrich, Jr., Technical Di rector, Waste Technology Service, Inc. (May 19, 1997) (RCRA Online #14235) \n(Attachment 25) (\u201cOver the past several  years  we have received numerous  questions concerning the regulatory \nstatus of used aerosol cans under the \u2026 hazardous waste regulations.  We are not at this time able to make a \ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range of products \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  \n   \n \n- 32 - \n \n \nUnder the regulations, aerosol s can and should be deemed empty once they are no longer \ncapable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for \nthe intended application  (e.g., once the can starts sputtering or other wise delivering an \nuneven spray) .  At that point, \u201c[a]ll waste s have been removed that can be removed using \nthe practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container [ i.e., \nan aerosol can] ,\u201d see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(i), since it wo uld not be common to keep \nusing an aerosol can once it is no longer dispensing the product properly.  In addition, at \nthat point, the aerosol can would almost certainly contain no more than 1 inch of \nchemical product  inside , as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(ii), since the chamber \nwith the chemical product is rarely (if ever) more than 8 inches tall and manufacturers \nseem unlikely to design a product that leaves more than 1/8th of the chemical product \nstranded inside after use.  Further, at this point , some significant portion of the propellant \nis likely to have been discharged, and in this sense the pressure would have \n\u201capproache[d] atmospheric,\u201d as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)( 2).  Thus, there is a \nsolid basis for issuing practical guidance that  an aerosol can qualifies as empty once it \nstops dispensing the chemical product in a proper way.41 \n \no Use of Statistics to Determine the Quantity of Aerosol Cans to be Counted Toward a \nGenerator\u2019s Status.   Under the proposed rule, VSQGs would not have to manage their \nhazardous aerosol can wastes in accordance with the universal waste rule (although they \ncould do so at their option).  We believe that a generator should be able to use statistical \ninformation ( e.g., from similar facilities) to determine the p ercentage of aerosol cans that \nneed to be counted toward the VSQG limit, without making a determination for each \nindividual can as to whether it is a hazardous waste, empty, etc.  EPA has previously \nallowed this type of approach for another situation in wh ich individual wastes of a \nparticular type may be either hazardous or nonhazardous,42 and we urge the Agency to \nconfirm that a similar approach may be used for aerosol cans.    \n \n9. Conclusion      \n \nFor the reasons discussed above,  the Retail Associations  strongly support the classification and \nregulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under RCRA.  Indeed, we believe \naerosol cans are particularly well suited for addition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all \n                                                 \n41  We also urge EPA to issue similar guidance on the issue of when aerosol cans no longer contain \n\u201csignificant liquids,\u201d which (as discussed in Section 5.3 above) is the standard that EPA has established for when \naerosol cans (whether \u201cempty\u201d or not) may be recycled as scrap metal.  \n \n42  See Letter from Michael Shapir o, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Lynn L. Bergeson (July 13, \n1995) (RCRA Online #14003) (Attachment 26) (\u201cwe believe that it would be appropri ate for a generator to rely on \n\u2018knowledge \u2019 of the waste \u2026 based on studies done to characterize the freq uency of \u2018hazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze \ngenerated (relative to the generation of \u2018nonhazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze), in order to characterize the total volume of \nhazardous waste generated.  [For example, if] data \u2026 indicate that up to 40% of the spent antifree ze flushed from \nradiators may be hazardous \u2026 it would be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total \nconsolidated volume of spent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60% nonhazardous. \u2026  [T]his \napproach would be appro priate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the purposes of being \neligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators\u201d).    \n \n- 33 - \n \n \nof the criteri a specified in the regulations for classification as universal wastes.  However, we urge \nEPA to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated and gas -only products, by \nremoving or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leakin g or damage, and by \nclarifying the status of empty aerosol cans.  Such changes are needed to make the rule workable \n(especially for retailers, which EPA estimates represent approximate two -thirds of the affected \ngenerator universe) and to maximize the bene fits of the rule .  The Agency should also clarify that as \nsoon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all \nstates without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.   \n \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings that would result from the rule are likely far \ngreater than EPA estimated in its RIA \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 million per year or more.  Although \nthis would be a major step forward in improving the r egulatory framework for aerosol cans , we \nalso believe it is imp ortant for the Agency issue guidance clarifying (a) that aerosol cans destined \nfor recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that aerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of \nreactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty once they are no longer capable of dispensing \nthe chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for the intended application , and \n(d) that generators may use statistical information to determine the quantity of a erosol cans that \nneed to be counted in determining their hazardous waste generator status.  EPA should try to \nissue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste rule, if that can be done \nwithout delaying the universal waste rule.  Howeve r, the first priority should be to issue a final \nuniversal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be followed up afterwards, if \nnecessary, with the guidance.    \n \nOnce again, we appreciate this opportunity to provide our comments on this pro posed \nrulemaking. We would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input and/or to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made above.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nAusten Jensen  \nVice President, Government Affairs  \nRetail Industry Leade rs Association  \n \n \n\n \n- 34 - \n \n \n \nStephanie K.

Manage the drained electrolyte as a hazardous waste unless you\nevaluate it asnon-hazardous. For more information on evaluating wastes, see MPCA fact sheet #w-hw1-01,\nEvaluate Waste, at: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw1-01.pdf.\nYou may also discharge universal waste batteriesif you can do so safely using eitherthe method recommended\nby the batterymanufactureror a complete discharge device (CDD). Do not simply short-circuit batteriesto\ndischarge them; it may cause a ire or batteryexplosion. Lithium batteriesdischarged toless thanone volt may\nbe managed asnon-hazardous waste in Minnesota, but mayremain subject to HMRtransport requirements.\nYou may accumulate different types of universal waste batteriestogether as long as you ensure they will not\nshort-circuit or cause a fire during accumulation.

You may need to enclose\neach batteryin anon-conducting bag or wrap, insulate terminals, or pack batteriesto prevent them from\ntouching each otheror conductive materials.\nLamps\nUniversal waste lamps include any hazardous waste bulb or tube portion of an electrical lighting device.\nuniversal waste lamps include, but are not limited to fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), mercuryvapor,\nlow and high pressure sodium (LPS and HPS), metal halide, and neon (includes lamps containing other noble\ngases such as argon, krypton, or xenon).\n'Greentip' fluorescent lamps\nCertain models of fluorescent lamps aredesigned to pass the hazardous wastetest for mercury, and are\ncommonly labeled as'low mercury' or by having green-colored metal end caps, known as'greentips'. These\nlamps do still contain mercury, and in Minnesota must still be recycled. 'Greentip' fluorescent lamps from\nbusinesses may not be disposed as solid waste.\nLEDs\nAlthough the bulb portions of most light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are not hazardous and thus not universal waste\nlamps, the attached circuit boards are regulated electronic wastes in Minnesota. See MPCA fact sheet\n#w-hw4-15, Managing Electronic Wastes, at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-15.pdf.\nOn-site crushingorcracking\nIn Minnesota, you may not crush the hazardous portion of universal waste lamps on your site unless you can\ndemonstratethat no hazardous constituents (such as mercury) will be released to the environment from the\nentire crushing process, including filterchanges.The MPCAis notawareofanycommerciallyavailablelamp\ncrushing equipment that can currentlymeet this standard.\nThe MPCA discourages cracking the shell of a universal waste lamp to attempt to remove the hazardous portion\nof the lamp. The hazardous portion of many universal waste lamps is contained in an inner sealed arctube or\ncapsule. Heat and chemical reactions in the arc tube may cause the glass to become brittle. This createsa high\nrisk for da mage a nd mercury release if you attempt to extract the tube from the la mp.\nAccumulation\nIf you accumulate more than 1000 universal waste lamps that you did not generate yourself, you must establish\nfinancial assurance with the MPCA.

However, some aerosols and compressed gas cylinders may\npresent unusual safety risks when punctured and be inadvisable for on-site management.\nSee MPCA fact sheet #w-hw4-00, Waste Aerosols and Compressed Gas Cylinders, at\nhttps://www. pca. state. mn. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-00. pdf.\nPage 5 of 6 I February 2018 ~ w-hw4-62\n\nMore Information\nGuidance and requirements in this fact sheet were compiled from the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 40,\nSection 273; Minnesota Statutes, Chapters \u00a718B and \u00a7115A; Minnesota Rules, Chapters 1509, 7001, and 7045;\nand incorporate regulatory interpretation decisions made by the MPCA on September 9, 2008; October 27,\n2008; December 31, 2008; and April 27, 2011; and June 10, 2015.

Waste Identification\nA company generates aerosol paint and solvent cans from\npainting and cleaning operations. The cans are empty as\nper common industry practices used to empty such devices\nto less than 3% by weight of the total capacity of the\ncontainer (40 CFR 261.7(b)(1(1) & (111)). The cans may\nstill contain propellant, making the cans reactive if\nput in contact with a strong initiating force (i.e.,\nintense pressure or heat). Since for all practicable\npurposes the cans are free of contents that might have\nbeen hazardous wastes, would this be regulation of the\naerosol cans themselves? RIL #43 specifically excluded\nthe regulation of the cans, and solely addressed only\nthe potentially hazardous contents. Therefore, would\naerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still\npotentially reactive because of contained propellant be\nregulated as hazardous waste?\nIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the\naerosol cans would be a RCRA hazardous waste\nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous\ncharacteristic of reactivity (40 CFR 261.23(a)(6)).\nSource: Mike Petruska (202) 475-6676\nResearch: Andy O'Hare\nRO 13027\n\nATTACHMENT 13\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOCTOBER 7, 1993\nMr. John DiFazio\nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association\n1913 Eye Street, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20006\nDear Mr. DiFazio:\nOver the past several years we have received numerous questions from you and others\nconcerning the regulatory status of used aerosol cans under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. I understand that confusion about these issues may be\nhindering your cooperative efforts with the Steel Recycling Institute (SRI) to increase steel aerosol can\nrecycling in this country. As environmentally protective recycling is an important part of the Agency's\nwaste management goals, I hope that this letter will help to answer some of these questions.\nRESIDENTIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFirst, I would like to emphasize that under the federal RCRA regulations, household waste\n(including aerosol cans) is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.4 (b) (1)).\nThus, any aerosol cans generated by households are not regulated as hazardous waste. Because this\nexclusion attaches at the point of generation (i.e., the household) and continues to apply throughout the\nwaste management cycle, household aerosol cans collected in municipal recycling programs and\nsubsequently managed in recycling programs continue to be excluded from the hazardous waste\nmanagement regulations.\nThe data submitted by SRI` appear to confirm that the majority of used residential aerosol cans\ncontain very little residual product or propellant. Along with your experience working with many of the\n600 or more communities currently recycling these cans, the data. suggest that aerosol cans can be\neffectively recycled.\nThe Agency does recommend that communities running residential steel recycling programs\neducate their participants to recycle only empty steel aerosol cans. Participants could also be educated\nto: 1) purchase only the amount of consumer products that they need to minimize the quantities of\nunused products, 2) give unused products to someone else who can use them, 3) take unused or\npartially full containers to a household hazardous waste collection program if available, or 4) dispose of\nthe partially full containers as directed on the label.\nCOMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFaxBack # 11780\n\nI understand that you and SRI are also interested in facilitating the recycling of aerosol cans\ngenerated by commercial or industrial generators. The remainder of this letter discusses only these non-\nhousehold waste items.\nWe have been asked whether aerosol cans e~chibit the characteristic of reactivity. At this time,\nthe Agency is not able to determine whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range\nof products are reactive. However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount of\nliquid would clearly meet the definition of scrap metal (40 CFR 261.1 (c)(6)), and thus would be\nexempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iv) if it were to be recycled. Therefore, a\ndetermination of reactivity or any other characteristic would not be relevant. Aerosol cans that have\nbeen punctured so that most of any liquid remaining in the can may flow from the can (e.g., at either end\nof the can), and drained (e.g., with punctured end down), would not contain significant liquids.\nIt should be noted that since the process of emptying the aerosol cans is part of a recycling\nprocess (i.e., scrap steel recycling), this activity would be exempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (except as specified in 40 CFR 261.6(d)). The Agency recommends that these activities be\nconducted in a safe and environmentally protective manner and that care be taken to properly manage\nany contents removed from the container (both liquids and gases). Any liquids or corrtained gases\nremoved from aerosol cans may be subject to regulation as hazardous wastes if they are listed in\nSubpart D of 40 CFR Part 261 or if they e~ibit any characteristics of hazardous waste as described in\nSubpart C of 40 CFR Part 261.\nWe have also been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of\n\"empty\" under 40 CFR 261.7. Again, if the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to\ndetermine whether they are \"empty\" under the criteria listed in 40 CFR 261.7 As long as an aerosol can\nbeing recycled does not contain significant liquids, the can is exempt as scrap metal. However, in order\nto dispose of a can as nonhazardous waste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to\ndetermine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7 (or that the product it contained was not\nhazardous), and that the can itself is not hazardous. If a can is to be disposed of, and either contains or\nis hazardous waste, it must be managed under all applicable regulations.\nPlease be aware that this letter addresses only the federal hazardous waste regulations.\nAuthorized State agencies implement the RCRA program in their states (although some parts of the\nprogram may be implemented by the U.S. EPA Regions), and that state regulations may be more\nstringent than the federal regulations. Anyone managing aerosol cans should contact the appropriate\nstate environmental agency or U.S. EPA Regional Office to determine how the regulations of that\nparticular state will apply to their activities.\nI hope this information is useful in your efforts to increase steel recycling.

Laws, Assistant Administrator\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nTO: Regional Administrators\nOn May 11, EPA promulgated a final rule which promotes the environmentally sound collection\nof several hazardous waste categories for recycling or proper disposal under the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This rule, known as the Universal Waste Rule (40 CFR Part\n273), creates a framework for streamlined regulatory requirements for hazardous waste batteries,\ncertain pesticides and mercury -containing thermostats (universal wastes). The Universal Waste rule is\ndesigned to achieve the following three goals: 1) encouraging resource conservation while ensuring\nadequate protection of human health and the environment, 2) improving implementation of the current\nSubtitle C hazardous waste regulatory program, and 3) removing these universal wastes from the\nmunicipal waste stream by providing incentives for individuals and organizations to collect currently\nunregulated wastes and then ensuring that treatment of those wastes meets the hazardous waste\nmanagement standards. To achieve these goals, environmentally sound collection systems must be\ndeveloped for universal wastes. As such, another goal is to foster the development of an appropriate\ncollection infrastructure in all of the States as quickly as possible.\nThe Agency encourages the timely development of the types collection systems allowed by this\nnew regulation. EPA recognizes that both States and private industry may delay the implementation of\nuniversal waste collection programs until States adopt and become authorized for this rule. To facilitate\nthe speedy implementation of the Universal Waste rule, EPA is encouraging States to quickly adopt the\nrule. Because most States are already authorized for the base RCR.A program, authorization for the\nUniversal Waste rule should be swift and uncomplicated. Therefore, Regions should make authorization\nof States for this rule a high priority in Regional State Authorization Programs and should process\nStates' authorization applications as quickly as possible.\nBy finalizing 40 C.F.R. Part 273, EPA has taken the position that managing wastes in\nFaxBack # 11960\n\ncompliance with those standards is environmentally protective. Therefore, where States are\nimplementing the Part 273 standards but have not yet received authorizarion, Regions should\ntalce enforcement actions involving universal wastes only where handlers of such wastes are not in full\ncompliance with the Part 273 standards. Regions should continue to address universal waste\nmanagement practices that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and\nthe environment under the authority provided in section 7003 of RCRA.\nIf you or your staff have any technical questions or concerns regarding the Universal Waste Rule\nor the policies contained in this memorandum, please contact Krishna Meson at (202) 260-5736 or\nBryan Groce at (202) 260-9550 of the Office of Solid Waste.\n\nATTACHMENT 16\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nFEB 13 1997\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT : Universal Waste Questions and Answers Document\nFROM: Mike Shapiro\nOffice of Solid Waste\nTO: Senior RCRA Policy Managers\nRegions I-X\nSince the promulgation of the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule (60 FR 25492),\nseveral States have begun to adopt the Federal program. As a result, many questions have been\nraised with respect to State implementation and enforcement for hazardous wastes covered\nunder the Universal Waste Federal program. Further, States have asked the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) Regional Offices for guidance on adding other types of hazardous\nwaste to their State universal waste programs. To assist those States during their\nimplementation process and to provide you with the Agency's position on these issues, the\nOffice of Solid Waste has prepared a Questions and Answers (Q&A) document. The Q&A\ndocument also addresses other issues related to universal waste management (e.g., universal\nwaste generation and transportation issues). I have attached the document for your information\nand encourage you to share it with the appropriate State Officials.\nIf you have any questions regarding State authorization, please contact Wayne Roepe\nat (703) 308-8630. If you have other questions regarding universal waste management, please\ncontact Bryan Groce of my staff at (703) 308-8750.\nAttachment\ncc: RCRA Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nState Authorization Section Chiefs, Regions I-X\nRCRA Community Relations Coordinators, Regions I-X\nRCRA Enforcement Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nFaxback# 14088\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - -UNIVERSAL WASTES (UW)\n1. Can a state include additional wastes in its UW program at the same time that it establishes\nthe program and then submit both the program and the additional UW to EPA for\nauthorization review at the same time? For example, can a state adopt a UW rule that\nregulates fluorescent bulbs and antifreeze as UW?\nYes, a state can designate additional waste streams as UW at the same time that it creates its\nown UW rule. However, it must find that the wastes meet its criteria for inclusion in the UW\nprogram, and its criteria must be analogous to the federal criteria set out in 273.81. See\npreamble to final UW rule at 60 FR 25512, 25537. The state need not submit the new wastes\nto EPA for authorization. EPA will review and authorize the state's UW program (including\nthe criteria for adding wastes to the program) and the 3 waste streams included in the federal\nprogram. EPA will not conduct any authorization review on any additional, state-only UW.\nEPA, however, requests that states send copies of tentative decisions to include new\nwastes (and proposed management standards for such wastes) to the appropriate FPA\nRegional Office to give EPA an opportunity to comment. See the response to question 5 for\nmore detail on this process.\n2. Can a state itself petition the Agency to add wastes to the federal UW rules - or does the\npetition have to come from a private party?\nA state itself can petition.\n3. a. How will the petition process work at the state level? Will it require public participation\nand rulemaking to add a UW to an authorized state program?\nEPA is requiring states to adopt petition procedures equivalent to the federal petition\nprocedures. This requires states to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on\nany tentative decision to grant or deny a petition to include new universal wastes. See the\npreamble at 60 FR 25537. EPA also assumes that the state will need to follow its normal\nrulemaking procedures to create any new management standards needed for the new UW.\nb. How will EPA adopt a UW -using the Federal Register and public comment process?\nYes. As required by 40 CFR 260.20 (c), if EPA receives a UW petition, it will publish a\nnotice of tentative decision and announce a comment period in the Federal Re  ~ister. After\nconsidering all comments, EPA will publish notice of its final decision in the Federal Re eci.\nThe same process applies to both decisions to grant and to decisions to deny petitions.\n4. a. Can a state add wastes that are state-only hazardous wastes?\nYes. State hazardous waste programs can be more stringent and broader in scope than federal\nprograms. Consequently, states may regulate as \"state-only\" hazardous wastes materials that\n\nare only solid wastes under the federal program. States may streamline their regulation of\nthese \"state-only\" hazardous wastes by including them in their UW programs.\nb. Can a state add wastes that are non-hazardous?\nYes. A state could add non-hazardous solid wastes to its UW program by designating such\nwastes as state-only hazardous wastes and then designating them as UW wastes. Such wastes\nwould be subject to the state's ordinary hazardous waste requirements for treatment and\ndisposal. EPA assumes that states would want this result, because they probably would\ndesignate nonhazardous wastes as universal wastes to divert them from the nonhazardous\nwaste disposal facilities that curently handle them. If, however, a state determined that some\naspects of its hazardous waste management regime should not apply to these state-only\nhazardous wastes, it could create exemptions. (Exemptions would be permissible since the\nwastes would not be regulated as hazardous wastes under the federal program.)\nOne exception applies. A state may not designate as a UW any waste that is hazardous\nunder the federal program due to a rule promulgated under HSWA authority for which the\nstate is not authorized. (For example, a state that was not authorized for the Toxicity\nCharacteristic could not designate a waste that exhibited the TC as a universal waste. See the\npreamble to the final rule at 25537.)\n5. After a state has adopted and is authorized for the UWR -does the state have ultimate\ndecision-making authority to add wastes or does EPA still have involvement? And what is\nEPA's role during the petition process, post authorization?\nStates authorized for the UW rule will not be required to submit program revisions for any\naddition of wastes to their UW program. EPA requests that states send a copy of their tentative\nfindings and any draft regulations for managing the new, state-only universal wastes to the\nappropriate EPA Regional Office. This will provide EPA with an opportunity to comment on\nthe state's proposed action. EPA encourages states to coordinate EPA's review and comment\nwith the opportunity to comment that the state must provide for the public. If EPA finds that a\nstate has added wastes that do not qualify, or that the management standards are not\nsufficiently protective, and that, as a result, the state's program is less stringent than the federal\nprogram, EPA has authority to withdraw authorization of the state's hazardous waste program\nas provided in Part 271.\nEPA will not conduct any authorization review of the new state-only UW and new\nmanagement standards. EPA takes the position that, when it authorizes a state to add wastes\nto the UW category, it authorizes in advance the state's new, state-only universal wastes and\nthe management standards for such wastes. All changes to state regulations needed to\nimplement a UW program for the new UW automatically become part of the authorized state\nprogram once they take effect under state law.\n6a. When will the EPA rule on fluorescent lights be final (designation as a Federal UW vs.\nmanagement as solid waste)?\nEPA has not yet decided when it will promulgate a final rule regarding regulation of\nfluorescent lamps as discussed in the July 1994 proposal.\n\nb. What happens if a state adds fluorescent lamps to its UWR and then EPA decides to come\nout with a conditional exemption for fluorescent lamps?\nIf the conditional exemption is less stringent than the state UW rule, the state would have the\noptio n of adopting the exemption, but would not be required to do so.\n7.a. Where do LDR recordkeeping requirements fit in --- only at the final destination facility?\nYes.\nb. Is the destination facility responsible (liable) for identifying the treatment\nstandards/technologies and filling out certification forms?\nYes. The destination facility is the first entity that handles a UW that is responsible for\ncompliance with any of the LDR requirements, including recordkeeping. For UW handlers\nthat are not subject to the LDR rules, the prohibitions on dilution under the UW program\nprovide the same protection as the dilution prohibition under the LDR program. (See. e.g., 40\nCFR 273.11.)\n8.a. Are all batteries included in the Federal UWR, or just those considered hazardous?\nEPA's federal UW program does not apply to all batteries. The exceptions are listed in 40\nCFR 273.2(b). Generally, the battery must first be a waste. (Note that unused batteries are\nnot always wastes -- someone must first make a decision to discard them (i.e., treat, recycle, or\ndispose of the unused batteries)). Next, the battery must be classified as a hazardous waste\nunder either a hazardous waste listing or a characteristic test and must not be generated by a\nhousehold. One category of batteries which are both wastes and hazardous wastes is\nnevertheless exempt from the UW regulations in Part 273: spent lead-acid batteries managed\nunder 40 CFR Part 266. Finally, the recently enacted \"Mercur}~Containing and Rechargeable\nBattery Management Act\" changes states' options for regulating some batteries which are\nhazardous waste under RCRA. Specifically, the law prohibits states from imposing\nrequirements that are not identical to those found in the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule\nfor the following types of hazardous waste batteries: used rechargeable batteries, lead-acid\nbatteries not covered by 40 CFR part 266 subpart G, rechargeable alkaline products, certain\nmercury-containing batteries banned from domestic sale, and used consumer products\ncontaining rechargeable batteries that are not easily removable. The law does allow states to\nimplement and enforce collection, storage, and transport requirements identical to those\nincluded in the Universal Waste rule.\nb. Do lead acid batteries fall under the UWR or do they stay under the lead-acid battery\nexemption?\nUnder the federal program, lead acid batteries are managed under Part 266, subpart G rather\nthan the UW program. EPA chose to retain the Part 266 standards for these batteries to avoid\ndisrupting the existing recycling program for such batteries because they provide for\n\nprotection of human health and the environment and because they have been highly successful\n(with recycling rates in excess of 90 percent). States, however, retain the authority to regulate\nlead-acid batteries more stringently. Hence, they may choose to regulate lead acid batteries\nunder their UW programs.\n9. A handler who transports UW is considered a UW transporter. Is this for any quantity of\nUW (i.e., in the used oil regulations a used oil generator can transport up to 55 gallons of their\nown used oil without being considered a used oil transporter)?\nYes, all handlers who transport any quantity of UW must meet the UW transporter\nrequirements. There is no de minimis exemption like the one in the used oil program.\n10. Would a program consisting of astate-sponsored network of handler locations at private\nbusinesses be considered a \"waste pesticide collection program\"?\nYes. Part 273 does not require states to operate the waste pesticide collection programs\ndescribed in 40 CFR 273.3(a)(2) in order for the pesticides managed under such programs to\nbe eligible for the UW program.\n11. As the UWR is implemented, do the traditional liability issues change? For example, who\nis liable for any mismanagement of a UW at a handler location, in transit, and at the\ndestination facility? Are any and all handlers liable for mismanagement at a destination\nfacility or at subsequent handlers? Or, just the \"final handler\" that chooses the destination\nfacility? Do we lose cradle-to-grave responsibility with UWR?\nUnder the full Subtitle C program, only the waste handler that violates a hazardous waste\nregulation is \"liable\" (i.e., subject to enforcement) for that violation. Generators of hazardous\nwaste are not responsible for mismanagement by subsequent waste handlers. The UW rule\ndoes not change this allocation of responsibility.\nGenerators are responsible for subsequent mismanagement under CERCLA, however.\nThe UW rule does not change CERCLA liability. Since UW are still hazardous wastes,\npersons who generate UW remain liable under CERCLA for remediation of any releases of\nUW.\n12. When UW is shipped to a destination facility, does it have to be relabeled as HW at that\nfacility, or will UW labeling be sufficient?\nUniversal wastes remain hazardous wastes. Destination facilities must comply with all\ncurrently applicable requirements for hazardous waste management facilities. However, none\nof these regulations require facility owners or operators to relabel the containers holding\nuniversal wastes.\n13a. Handlers can keep UW on site up to one year after the date it is received or generated. A\nyear after a handler has received a UW, can the UW go to another handler, or must it go to\ndestination facility?\n\nUniversal waste can only be sent off-site to another universal waste handler, destination\nfacility, or foreign destination. Theoretically, each receiving facility could accumulate the\nwaste for an entire year before sending it off to another handler, however, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\nb. Within that year, can the UW go to several handlers?\nYes, but states can adopt a more stringent rule that would prevent this. Also, although\ntheoretically wastes could go from one collection facility to another forever, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\n14. Pesticides that are included in FIFRA recalls can be managed under the UWR. Does this\napply to pesticides that have been included in past FIFRA recalls or just recalls instituted after\nthe UWR is adopted?\nThe timing of the recall is not significant. The UW rule is not limited to pesticides that are\nrecalled after the UW rule takes effect.\n15. Pesticides that are managed by farmers in accordance with 40 CFR 262.70 are not subject\nto the UW rules. Can farmers continue to dispose of pesticides recalled under FIFRA under\n262.70?\nYes, if a recall under FIFRA allows a farmer to dispose of a pesticide on his own property, he\nmay do so by complying with 262.70.\n16. How are mixtures of UW and HW regulated -- as a HW if the HW is listed or the mixture\ne~ibits a characteristic? If the HW is not listed, and the mixture of UW and HW does not\nexhibit a characteristic, does LDR apply to the mixture?\nThe UW rules apply only to wastes meeting the criteria for being classified as UW. They do\nnot apply to mixtures of UW wastes and ordinary, \"norruniversal\" hazardous wastes. Such\nmixtures are subject to the regular hazardous waste regulations.\nHowever, the status of mixtures of characteristic UW and characteristic hazardous\nwastes needs clarification. If the mixture no longer eachibits a characteristic, it would no\nlonger be classified as a hazardous waste, but would remain subject to the land disposal\nrestrictions. Formerly characteristic wastes are not excused from compliance with LDR\ntreatment standards merely because they cease to exhibit a characteristic.\nIn addition, two exceptions apply. First, mixtures of UW and conditionally exempt\nsmall quantity generator (CESQG) hazardous wastes are subject to UW rules. This is because\nCESQG hazardous wastes are exempt from regular Subtitle C regulation. See the UW\npreamble at 25510. By the same logic, mixtures of UW wastes and hazardous wastes\nexempted under the household hazardous waste provision are subject to the UW provisions\nrather than the regular hazardous waste provisions.\n\nThe normal hazardous waste mixture rules would apply to mixtures of UW and\nnonhazardous solid wastes. If the UW waste were a listed waste, the mixture would be\nregulated as HW (although initial handlers would be subject only to the UW rules). If the UW\nwere a characteristic waste, and the mixture ceased to exhibit the characteristic, the mixture\nwould be nonhazardous but LDR treatment requirements would continue to apply.\n17. A large quantity universal waste handler (LQHLJW) is required to notify EPA of its\nuniversal waste management, unless it had already so notified and received an EPA ID\nnumber. However, won't the LQHUW have to modify the initial notification to explain this\nadditional activity?\nNo. If a handler has previously notified EPA of his hazardous waste management activities,\nhe is not required to renotify. First time notifiers can submit aone-time notification described\nin 40 CFR 273.32(b), or alternatively, the 8700-12 notification form. If the 8700-12\nnotification form is used, the LQHUW must write \"LQHIJW\" or \"Universal Waste\" on the\nportion of the form where activity is checked.\n18. Does the UWR prohibit a generator from handling a UW in accordance with full RCRA C\nrequirements, if desired?\nThe UWR requires a generator to handle their UW under 273. However, if the generator\nhandles UW under full RCRA C then it would likely be complying with 273.\n19. If a generator originates a shipment of hazardous waste that is considered a UW in the\nreceiving state, how does the generator get a signed manifest?\nThe initiating facility (i.e., the generator) would complete a manifest and give copies to the\nhazardous waste transporter as required under 40 CFR 262.23(a). The initiating facility must\nensure that the manifest is forwarded to and signed by the UW receiving facility (i.e., the\ndesignated TSD facility) and then sent back to the initiating facility.\n20. a. Because a manifest is now not required, how will handlers know how and when their\nUW finally arrives at an appropriate destination facility?\nDepending on whether the UW are shipped to another UW handler or a UW destination\nfacility, the initiating facility (i.e., the generator) may not know if their UW arrives at an\nappropriate destination facility. For example, if the universal waste is shipped to another\nuniversal waste handler (i.e., an interim facility) before it is shipped to a designated facility,\nthe originating facility would only have knowledge of the initial receiving facility. (See\nresponse to question 11). However, if the originating facility (i.e., the generator) sent the\nuniversal waste to a destination facility, Part 273 requires the originating facility to receive\nprior consent by a receiving facility (i.e., the destination facility) before the waste can be sent\noff-site.\n\nb. Does EPA intend for the original handler to \"designate\" all the handlers and final\ndestination facility?\nNo. The original handler (i.e., the initiating facility) is only responsible for designating the\nnext UW handler (though the original handler is free to elect to designate the final destination\nfacility)\n21. What happens when UWR is adopted by a state but is not yet authorized by EPA? What\nis EPA obligated to enforce?\nEPA may only enforce the authorized state program. The authorized program would continue\nto impose regular hazardous waste management standards on UW handlers until EPA\napproved the state's UW rule. Note, however, that once the rule is approved, designations of\nnew, state-only UW and management standards for such wastes become part of the authorized\nprogram without action by EPA. See the response to question 5 above.\nThe Agency has also issued a memorandum (See the April 10, 1996 Memorandum\naddressed to the Regional Administrators from Steven A. Herman, Assistant Administrator of\nthe Office of Enforcement and Compliance and Elliot P. Laws, Assistant Administrator of the\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response) which asks the EPA Regional offices to\nexercise enforcement discretion (vis a vis unmanifested universal wastes) in States that are\nauthorized for the RCRA base program and that are implementing the Part 273 standards but\nhave not yet received final EPA authorization to do so. The memorandum further provides\nthat the Regions should take enforcement actions involving universal waste only where\nhandlers of such wastes are not in full compliance with the Part 273 standards. In other words,\nthe Agency will not take federal action against handlers who manage hazardous waste\nbatteries, hazardous waste pesticides, and mercurycontaining thermostats pursuant to Part 273\nstandards in States that are currently in the process of adopting the universal waste rule.\nStates, of course, may still pursue enforcement action against these handlers. The Agency\nhopes that the April 10, 1996 letter will facilitate implementation of the universal waste rule\nby states nationwide.\n22. How are recycling facilities that receive UW regulated?\nRecycling facilities are excluded from the definition of UW \"handlers\". See 40 CFR 273.6.\nThey are subject to normal hazardous waste management requirements. Under those\nrequirements, storage prior to recycling is regulated and requires a permit. See 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (1). Many types of recycling processes are largely exempt from regulation (see 40\nCFR 261.6(d)); others (such as burning to recover energy or materials) are regulated and\nrequire permits.\n\nATTACHMENT 17\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOFFICE OF\nSOLID WASTE AND\nEMERGENCY\nRichard J. Barlow, Chair\nNortheast Waste Management Officials' Association (NEWMOA)\n129 Portland Street, Suite 601\nBoston, MA 02114-2014\nDear Mr. Barlow:RESPONSE\nI am pleased to respond to your May 23,1996 letter, in which you support the\nState of New York Department of Environmental Conservation rulemaking petition\nregarding 40 CFR Part 263 relative to the transportation of hazardous waste. I also\nunderstand that you have serious concerns about the recent preemption determination\nby the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) which was published on December 6,\n1995. (See 60 FR 62527). Specifically, you desire more regulatory oversight than is\ncurrently provided by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)\nregulations for hazardous waste activities at transfer facilities.\nAs you know, the recent DOT preemption decision cited in your letter arose from\na challenge lodged by the transporter industry against certain New York State\nregulations pertaining to activities at hazardous waste transfer facilities. Briefly, the\nState had enacted regulations which, among other things, prohibited certain load\nmixing activities at transfer facilities, and imposed secondary containment requirements\nin areas of these facilities reserved for off-vehicle storage. There is no federal\ncounterpart to these state regulations in EPA's Part 263 regulations, and DOT's\nregulations do not impose similar restrictions. In the decision published in the Federal\nRegister of December 6,1995, DOT held that each of the challenged State regulations\nwas preempted, because each was inconsistent with the uniform scheme of federal\nregulation which Congress intended for the control of interstate transportation of\nhazardous materials.\nWe are well aware of the long-standing interest of the States in the issues\nsurrounding the regulation of hazardous waste transfer facilities. I also understand that\nunless and until there are revisions to the federal regulations governing transfer\nfacilities, States which act alone to fill the perceived gaps in the federal RCRA\ntransporter regulations (40 CFR Part 263) are likely to face similar challenges under the\nstrong preemption authorities included by Congress in the 1990 amendments to the\nHazardous Materials Transportation act (HMTA).\nRO 14135\n\nWhile I understand the resource issues that States are facing when they are\nforced to defend the validity of their laws before DOT or the courts, I note that this\npredicament arises primarily from the manner in which the Congress has allocated\nresponsibility among the federal agencies and the States in the transportation area. The\nCongress has spoken in fairly unequivocal terms in RCRA 3003(b) that RCRA\nrequirements addressing transporters must be consistent with the HMTA and\nregulations issued thereunder. The HMTA in turn provides DOT with considerable\nauthority to preempt inconsistent State laws, particularly in certain of the so-called\n\"covered areas\" of hazardous materials regulation affected by New York's contested\nrequirements, or, in those instances where inconsistent State laws would pose an\nobstacle to accomplishing or cat-tying out the HMTA's scheme of regulation. See 49\nU.S.C. '5125. These types of strong preemption authorities are quite foreign to RCRA,\nbut they are introduced into the transporter area by the statutory directive in RCRA to\nmaintain consistency with the DOT framework.\nOn March 1,1996, the Office of Solid Waste (OSW) stated to Commissioner\nZagata of New York that OSW could not at this time commit our scarce federal\nrulemaking resources to the transfer facility problem without diverting resources from\nwhat I believe to be greater priorities for the RCRA program as a whole. This is still true\ntoday. However, at such time as our resources and priorities permit, we will revisit the\nmerits of committing resources to resolving the transfer facility concerns. I do, however,\nappreciate NEWMOA's interest in supporting such a rulemaking.\nI would like to be able to respond more positively to your letter at this time, but I\nknow that our state partners understand that in these times, we must allocate our\nresources and energies judiciously. Thank you for bringing these concerns and\nsuggestions to my attention. We appreciate the efforts of NEWMOA and its state\nmembers for their strong support for improving the RCRA program\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 14135\n\nATTACHMENT Z S\n\n9461.1994(02)\nSTORAGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AT TRANSFER FACILITIES AND THE\nAUTHORIZATION OF STATES REGULATING THIS STORAGE\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nAugust 17, 1994\nCharles Dickhut\nChemical Waste Transportation Institute\n4301 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nSuite 300\nWashington, D.C. 20008\nDear Mr. Dickhut,\nThank you for your letter of June 3,1994, in which you\nrequest that EPA clarify and reaffirm its interpretations and\npolicies regarding the storage of hazardous waste at transfer\nfacilities, the authorization of states for provisions regulating\nthis storage, and the preemption of such provisions by the\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) under the Hazardous Materials\nTransportation Act (HMTA).\nIn your letter you request that EPA reaffirm specific\nprevious interpretations of the 10-day storage limitation for\ntransfer facilities. RCRA regulations at 40 CFR 263.12 state that\n\"a transporter who stores manifested shipments of hazardous waste\nin containers meeting the requirements of 262.30 at a transfer\nfacility for a period of ten days or less is not subject to\nregulation under Parts 270, 264, 265, and 268 of this chapter with\nrespect to the storage of those wastes.\" These regulations do not\nrestrict the use of multiple transfer facilities for one shipment\nnor do they place further restrictions on the number of days\navailable at each facility (i.e., they do not limit the total\nnumber of days spent at all transfer facilities to 10). Of course,\neach transfer facility must meet the definition found at 260.10.\nA key element of the 260.10 definition is the \"normal course\nof transportation.\" Storage of manifested shipments of hazardous\nwaste at a transfer facility must be within the normal course of\nRO 13692\n\ntransportation. As the Agency has stated in the past, EPA can\nenvision situations in which hazardous waste maybe stored atone\ntransfer facility for 10 days, and then be stored at a second\ntransfer facility for. an additiona110 days, and remain within the\nnormal course of transportation (see the attached June 7,1990\nletter from Sylvia Lawrence to Robert Duprey and the June 22,1994,\nletter from Michael Petruska to Kevin Igli).\nYour letter also asked for clarification of the phrase \"normal\ncourse of transportation.\" The 10-day storage limitation at\ntransfer facilities was based on information provided by the\ntransportation industry, which indicated that shipments of\nhazardous waste normally take no longer than 15 days, including\nboth the actual transportation and the temporary holding of the\nshipment (see 45 FR 86966, December 31,1980). Individual\ncircumstances, however, may prevent shipments from being completed\nwithin this time period. EPA believes that what constitutes \"the\nnormal course of transportation\" depends on the particular facts of\neach case. Therefore, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to\nset a generic time limit beyond which a shipment would\nautomatically be outside the normal course of transportation.\nYou next inquire whether the authorization of a provision\naffecting the storage of hazardous wastes at transfer facilities\nunder 3006 of RCRA would make that provision no longer subject to\npreemption under the HMTA because it was \"otherwise authorized by\nFederal law.\" (See 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a).) EPA formulated its\ncurrent position on RCRA state authorization and preemption under\nthe HMTA during the 1992 authorization of California for the base\nRCRA program. EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to use\nthe RCRA Subtitle C authorization process to make specific\ndeterminations of possible preemption under the HMTA. Pursuant to\nthe HMTA, the DOT has established procedures both for making\npreemption determinations and providing waivers from preemption.\nA possible issue of preemption under HMTA would not affect the\nprogram's eligibility for RCRA authorization where the preemption\nconcern is unrelated to RCRA authorities. (See 57 FR 32726, July\n23,1992, and the attached October 29, 1992, letter from Devereaux\nBarnes to Cynthia Hilton). Thus, EPA still believes that the RCRA\nauthorization decisions provide no basis for shielding state\nregulations touching upon hazardous materials transport from\npossible preemption challenges raised under the HMTA.\nFinally, you ask whether EPA has the authority to review a\nRO 13692\n\nstate's interpretation of an authorized provision. You cite the\nArkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology's (DPC&E)\ninterpretation of the 10-day transfer facility storage limitation\nas a cause for concern. According to your letter, the DPC&E\nenforces a 10-day storage limitation that applies to the total\nstorage time at all transfer facilities, not the storage time at\neach one. Although EPA has a different interpretation than what\nyou have described for the DPC&E, the state of Arkansas is\nauthorized for the transporter requirements, and thus has primary\nauthority for implementing them. EPA's response to a state's\ninterpretation of an authorized provision would depend on how it\nwas implemented in a particular situation, and factors such as any\nrelevant state court decisions or an enforcement action. EPA is\ncurrently not aware of any instance where this differing\ninterpretation has been implemented. Further, EPA believes that\nthe question of whether Arkansas' interpretation deviates from\nnational HMTA transportation standards should be addressed under\nthe HMTA preemption process, rather than through RCRA state\nauthorization.\nI hope that this clarification is of assistance to you.\nFurther guidance regarding the issues you have raised maybe\navailable in the future, as a result of EPA discussions with DOT.\nIf you have further questions regarding the authorization of states\nfor the regulation of hazardous waste transporters and transfer\nfacilities, please contact Wayne Roepe of my staff at 703-308-8630.\nIf you have further questions regarding the EPA regulations\nregarding the transportation of hazardous waste, please contact Ann\nCodrington of my staff at 202-260-4777.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 13692\n\nATTACHMENT 19\n\n9541.1985(07)\nRCRA/SUPERFUND HOTLINE MONTHLY SUMMARY\nMAY 85\nManifest Use and State Authorization\n3. A spent solvent, which is hazardous by characteristic only (e.g.\nignitable D001), is transported from the generator in Montana, to a\nreclamation facility in Texas. Both Montana and Texas are states with\nfinal authorization for the RCRA program. The transporter will also go\nthrough Wyoming which is anon-authorized state (i.e., it is under the\nFederal RCRA program).\nPursuant to 40 CFR ~261.6(a), characteristic hazardous wastes which are\nreclaimed are not subject to RCRA regulations. According to ~261.2(c)\nas amended by the January 4,1985, Federal Register (50 FR 614), however,\nall spent solvents, characteristic or listed, will be defined as \"spent\nmaterials\" and will be regulated as \"solid wastes\" prior to reclamation.\nThus, per ~261.6(b), in the January 4,1985, rule, generators and\ntransporters of recyclable hazardous materials (e.g., spent solvents) are\nsubject to Parts 262 and 263 (generator and transporter standards,\nrespectively). The complicating factor is that this new definition of\nsolid waste and respective recycling regulations may go into effect at\ndifferent times through the country depending on whether a state is\nauthorized or not.\nThe January 4, 1985, rule will be effective in non-authorized states on\nJuly 5,1985. States with final authorization, such as Montana and\nTexas, may have up to January 4,1987, to adopt this rule. Therefore,\na characteristic ignitable spent solvent will be a regulated hazardous\nwaste prior to reclamation in non-authorized states on July 5,1985. In\nthe transport situation described above, is the transporter required to\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest in Wyoming, since the spent\nsolvent is a \"hazardous waste\" in Wyoming on July 5,1985?\nIf the spent solvent is transported from Montana to Texas (EPA-\nauthorized states) after July 5,1985, the transporter need not\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest, even though the spent\nsolvent is transported through Wyoming, which regulates the\nsolvent as a RCRA waste. States through which the waste shipment\ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements per 49 FR 1049\nRO 12399\n\n(March 20, 1984). When either the generator state (Montana) or\nthe designated state (Texas) determines that the waste is\nhazardous, that waste will be subject to the Uniform Manifest\nrequirements.\nSource: Denise Hawkins (202) 382-2231\nRO 12399\n\nATTACHMENT ZO\n\nRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potential Costs,\nBenefits, and Other Impacts of the Final Hazardous Waste\nGenerator Improvements Rule\nPrepared for\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nOffice of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR)\n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW (Mailstop 5305P)\nWashington DC, 20460 USA\nSeptember 2016\n\n2.3 HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED FACILITIES\nThis section characterizes the hazardous waste generation of facilities in the regulated universe. The\noverall tonnages of hazardous waste and the number of waste streams are relevant to estimating the cost\nof managing this waste in compliance with the provisions of the final rule. The methodology for\nestimating the quantities of hazardous waste generation varies by generator status. Where possible, this\nRIA relies on generation data from EPA's 2013 BR database. The BR database is used to develop annual\naggregate and per facility generation estimates for LQG facilities. For other facility types, however, the\ndata available from the BR database are insufficient to develop nationwide hazardous waste generation\nestimates. Consequently, this RIA derives generation estimates for SQGs and VSQGs by combining the\nlimited data available in the BR database with facility-level generation data obtained from individual\nstates.\n2.3.1 LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION\nEPA's 2013 BR database is the primary data source for estimating hazardous waste generation for LQG\nfacilities. In 2013, LQGs generated approximately 35.2 million tons of hazardous waste in aggregate.\nCombining this value with the LQG facility count presented above suggests that LQGs, on average,\ngenerate approximately 1,692 tons of hazardous waste per facility per year.14 The BR data also suggest\nthat LQGs reported an average of 13 different waste streams per facility, with a few large facilities\nreporting several thousand waste streams. The SO largest LQGs generated 29.2 million tons of hazardous\nwaste, or 83 percent of the total amount reported in the 2013 BR.\nExhibit 2-5 reports the overall and average per facility hazardous waste quantities generated on an annual\nbasis as well as the average number of waste streams per facility for LQGs by state. As shown in the\nexhibit, the Gulf States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi account for approximately 63 percent of all\nhazardous waste generated by LQGs in the United States. In contrast, New York and California, which\nhave the largest number of LQG facilities, collectively account for just 5 percent of all hazardous waste\ngenerated by LQGs.\nExhibit 2-6 provides information on the distribution of LQGs by industry. Facilities in the BR database\nmay be characterized by one or several North American Industry Classification System (NAILS) codes.\nTo avoid double-counting, this RIA uses the first (or primary) NAILS code listed in the BR database for a\nfacility. As shown in the exhibit, the five largest industries (in terms of hazardous waste generation)\naccount for approximately 95 percent of all hazardous waste generated by LQGs, while comprising less\nthan 20 percent of all LQGs. These industries include: chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); petroleum\nand coal products manufacturing (NAILS 324); waste management and remediation services (NAILS\n562); primary metal manufacturing (NAILS 331); and mining (NAILS 212). In terms of the number of\ngenerators, the largest industries \u2014accounting for approximately 50 percent of the LQG universe \u2014\ninclude: health and personal care stores (NAILS 446); chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); utilities\n(NAILS 221); fabricated metal product manufacturing (NAILS 332); and general merchandise stores\n(NAILS 452).\n~~ This average (mean) value includes a small number of facilities that generate more than one mill(on tons of hazardous waste per year. Thus,\nwhereas the mean generation value per LQG is 1,692 tons per year, the median (50'~ percentile) is only 7.6 tons per year. Because the cost and\nbenefit calculations in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively, do not use LQG waste generation as an Input (incremental costs and benefits for LQGs\nunder the rule are not dependent on waste quantities), the choice of using the mean or median has no impact on the estimated costs and benefits\nof the rule.\n2-9\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nSTATE\nANUMBER OF\nFACILITIES\nIN BR DATA\nBTOTAL HAZARDOUS\nWASTE GENERATED\n(TONS)\nCPERCENTAGE OF\nTOTAL\nHAZARDOUS\nWASTE\n[D]HAZARDOUS WASTE\nGENERATED PER\nFACILITY\n(TONS)\nE=C/BAVERAGE\nNUMBER OF\nWASTE STREAMS\nPER FACILITY\n[F]\nAlabama\nAlaska386\n27708,436\n2,272\n73,948\n405,592\n1,519,549\n37,0002.0%\n0.0%1,835\n8413\n20\nArizona\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nColorado\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nDistrict of Columbia210\n101\n2,775\n108\n416\n60\n36\n386\n517\n90.2% 352 17\n1.2% 4,016 27\n4.3% 548 13\n0.1%\n0.1%343\n4760\n19,666 12\n14,886\n551\n107, 387\n280, 866\n165\n466,293\n4,624\n613,053\n1,026,7080.0% 248 40\n0.0% 15 8\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nGuam\nHawaii\nIdaho\nIllinois\nIndiana\nIowa\nKansas0.3%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n1.3%\nO.OY\n1.7%\n2.9%278 16\n543 11\n18 70\n23\n23\n836-710\n144\n21320,274 35\n201 28\n733 10- -- -- -----1,446 13\n51, 095 0.1 % 355 9\n1,349,985 3.8% 6,338 9\nKentuc\nLouisiana\nMaine\nMa land297\n368\n87\n469\n415\n493\n340\n~ 164\n330\n62\n1194,945 0.6% 656 27\n4,789,750 13.6%\n0.0%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n1.8%\n1.0%\n4.5%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n0.0%13,016 11\n3,048 35 8\n47,995 102 9\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMississippi\nMissouri\nMontana\nNavajo Nation\nNebraska\nNevada29,285 71\n1,274\n1,029\n9,695\n854\n114\n3\n424\n15614\n17\n9627,889\n349,886\n~ 1,590,017 7\n281,820 11\n7,065 9\n3\n29, 225\n14,688\n3,293\n396,104\n889,2564\n22\n13\n42\n_ 48\n8769 0.1 %\n94\n1340.0%\nNew Hampsh ire\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico0.0%\n1.1%25\n711 557\n41 2.5%_\n21,689\nNew York 3,095 234,378\n77,163\n375,751\n00.7% 76 4\n22\n6\n0North Carolina 675 0.2%\n1.1q\n0.0%114\n14,452\n0North Dakota 26\nNorthern Marianas 0\nOhio 975 1,539,561 4.4% 1,579 16\nOklahoma 170 100, 331 0.3% 590 7\nOre on 210 56,930 0.2% 271 10\nPenns lvania 1,004 257,716 0.7%\n0.1%\n0.0%257\n382\n598\n22\n17Puerto Rico 94 35,902\nRhode Island 103 6,083\nSouth Carolina 386 176,950 0.5% 458 8\nSouth Dakota 31 1,460 0.0% 47 7\nTennessee 363 97,020 0.3% 267 6\nTexas 970 15,624,473 44.4% 16,108 7\nTrust Territories 0 0 0.0% 0 0\nUtah 127 40,359 0.1% 318 28\n2-10\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nPERCENTAGE OFHAZARDOUS WASTE AVERAGE\nNUMBER OF TOTAL HAZARDOUS TOTAL GENERATED PER NUMBER OF\nFACILITIES WASTE GENERATED HAZARDOUS FACILITY WASTE STREAMS\nSTATE IN BR DATA (TONS) WASTE (TONS) PER FACILITY\n[A] B C D [E=C/B F]\nVermont 43 3,323 0.0% 77 12\nVirgin Islands 1 10,064 0.0%~ 10,064 17\nVirginia 397 58,641 0.2%~ 148 12\nWashington 258,975 0.7% 568 16 456\nWest Virginia 144 52,027 0.1% 361 10\nWisconsin--424 204, 520__\n0.6% 482 9\nWyoming 22 3,493 0.0~ 159 13\nTOTALz 20,771 35,151,466 100.0% 1, 692 13\nNotes:\n1.

Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (OS-300)\nTO: Karl E. Bremer, Chief\nRCRA Permitting Branch\nOffice of RCRA, Region 5 (HRP-8J)\nThis is in response to your memorandum of November 20,1992\nregarding Heritage Environmental Services, Inc. in Lemont,\nIllinois, and the burning of a propellant mixture (mostly butane\nand propane) in the company's boiler. You specifically asked\nwhether the burning of this mixture constitutes burning of a\nhazardous waste which would require them to comply with the boiler\nand industrial furnace (BIF) regulations.\nSubpart H of 40 CFR Part 266 regulates the burning or\nprocessing of hazardous waste in boilers and industrial furnaces.\nHowever, before a substance can be classified as a hazardous waste,\nit must first meet the definition of a solid waste. In determining\nwhether the butane and propane propellants are solid wastes, it\nmust also be decided whether the burning of these materials\nconstitutes the burning for energy recovery of a propellant (is a\nsolid waste), or use as a fuel (is not a solid waste) for the\nreasons stated below.\nAs stated in your memo, Heritage plans to recover the\nmaterials from the aerosol cans and separate them into three\nstreams: (1) scrap metal (crushed cans), (2) a liquid phase\n(household chemicals), and (3) a gaseous phase (propellants, mostly\nbutane and propane). Heritage then plans to burn the recovered\npropellants from the aerosol cans in their on-site boiler for\nRO 11717\n\nenergy value.\nAccording to 40 CFR Section 261.2(c)(2)ii regulations,\ncommercial chemical products that are listed in 40 CFR Section\n261.33 as well as non-listed commercial chemical products that\nexhibit hazardous waste characteristics (see attached Apri111,\n1985 Federal Register notice explaining the regulatory status of\nnon-listed commercial chemical products), are not classified as\nsolid wastes when burned for energy recovery if they are themselves\nfuels. Since propane and butane are materials that are normally\nboth used as fuels, when unused, they can be burned as fuels\nwithout being considered solid wastes.\nTherefore, if the aerosol cans are full (not used), or\npartially full (in which case they would be considered off\nspecification with the remaining propellants in the cans also being\nunused), then the butane and propane propellants would be\nclassified as commercial chemical products. Since these products\nare fuels and being burned for energy recovery, they would not fall\nwithin the definition of a solid waste and would consequently not\nbe considered a hazardous waste.\nFor the reasons stated above, Heritage would not be required\nto comply with the BIF regulations to burn the butane and propane\npropellants in their on-site boiler. However, this determination\nassumes that other hazardous constituents have been separated from\nthe butane and propane propellants, and that the butane and propane\nare indeed being burned for energy recovery rather than to destroy\nother hazardous constituents contained in the aerosol cans.\nIf you have any additional questions or would like to discuss\nthis further, please contact Karen Randolph of my staff on (703)\n308-8651.\nAttachment\ncc: Christine Dibble, OSW; Mike Petruska, CAD; Steve\nSilverman, OGC; Bob Holloway, WMD; Sonya Sasseville, PSPD\nbcc: Juana Rojo, Region 5; Waste Combustion Permit Writers'\nWorkshop; Karen Randolph PSPD\nRO 11717\n\nATTACHMENT 22\n\n9432.1988(04)\nAEROSOL CANS, ON-SITE DEPRESSURIZATION OF\nOFFICE OF SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nSEP 1988\nKurt E. Whitman, Project Coordinator\nSWInc.\nP.O. Box B\nSaukville, WI 53080\nDear Mr. Whitman:\nThis is in response to your July 1,19881etter requesting\nclarification on EPA's current interpretation on whether the\ndepressurization of aerosol cans on-site would be considered\ntreatment, requiring a RCRA permit. You also requested\npertinent information on Ril #43 and on whether or not it has\nbeen rescinded. I am enclosing per your request a copy of Ril\n43 and the 1985 memorandum which I believe is the one you are\nrequesting.\nYou revealed in a July 26, 1988 telephone conversation with\nDoreen Sterling of my staff that your main interest in this\nissue was to determine the requirements for disposal of a wide\nvariety of aerosol cans located at a number of Department of\nDefense facilities throughout the country.\nThe Agency is aware that conflicting interpretations have\nbeen given by the EPA Regional Offices, EPA Office of Solid\nWaste, and the RCRA Hotline regarding whether certain aerosol\ncan disposal methods constitute treatment and whether or not a\npermit is required for this activity. The Agency is currently\nevaluating this problem and may decide to issue more specific\nguidance in the future if it is warranted. It is our policy,\nhowever, to refer issues of this nature to the Region in which\nthe facility is located since they are normally best able to\nmake acase-by-case determination on whether: (1) the waste in\nquestion is hazardous according to our regulations and\n(2) treatment is occurring.\nRO 13225\n\nAccording to our regulations, cans are hazardous if: (1)\nthey contain a commercial chemical product on the 40 CFR\n261.33(e) or (f) lists or exhibit one or more of the hazardous\nwaste charactreistics, and are not empty as defined under Sec.\n261.7; and/or (2) they exhibit any of the characteristics of\nhazardous waste identified in Part 261, Subpart C.\nTreatment, as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, means any method,\ntechnique, or process, including neutralization, designed to\nchange the physical, chemical, or biological character or\ncomposition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such\nwaste, or so as to recover energy or material resources from the\nwaste, or so as to render such waste nonhazardous, or less\nhazardous; safer to transport, store, or dispose of; or amenable\nfor recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume.\nIt should be noted that if any of the aerosol cans are\nincluded as part of household waste (i.e., from military\nhousing), those cans are exempt from RCRA Subtitle under\nSection 261.4(b)(1).\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact Doreen\nSterling of my staff at 202-475-6775.\nSincerely\nOriginal Document signed\nSylvia K Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nEnclosures\nRO 13225\n\nATTACHMENT 23\n\nPPC 9443.1984(10)\nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION REACTIVITY, OFF SPECIFICATION\n30 NOV 1984\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT: Classification of Small Arms Ammunition\nWith Respect to Reactivity\nFROM: John H. Skinner, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (WH-562)\nTO: David Wagoner, Director\nAir &Waste Management Division\nRegion VIII\nRecently, a question arose as to the status under RCRA of\noff-specification small arms ammunition (ball or sporting\nammunition of calibers up to and including 0.50) intended for\ndisposal. The issue concerned whether such wastes are \"reactive\nwastes\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6) and, therefore,\nsubject to RCRA hazardous waste requirements. Because the\nammunition contains an ignition source that maybe shock and heat\nsensitive and is designed to generate high pressure during use, it\nhad been our opinion that it is probably \"reactive.\" However, on\nthe basis of information that was received from the Remington\nArms Company and the Army, we now conclude that such materials\nare no \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).\nSection 261.23 (a)(6) of Title 40 provides that a solid\nwaste which is \"capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it\nis subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under\nconfinement\" is \"reactive.\" As discussed in the May 19, 1980,\npreamble to 40 CFR 261.23, shock and thermal instability are\nimportant elements of this definition. While presently there is\nno Agency guidance regarding these criteria, the Remington Arms\nCompany of Independence, Missouri, and the U.S. Army have provided\ninformation which addresses both of these factors.\nRemington Arms Company submitted details on the effects of\nheat and impact to small arms ammunition. There was no explosion\nRO 12339\n\nwhen a box of ammunition was set afire. Small arms, when subjected\nto the SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute)\nImpact Test, showed no evidence of mass propagation or explosion.\nThe Department of the Army has a rigorous safety and hazard\ntesting program on all munition items. The tests, which include\ndrop tests from 5, 7, and 40 feet to simulate handling errors\nand \"heating under confinement,\" 160\u00b0F for 48 hours, also\nshowed no evidence of detonation or explosion with respect to\nsmall arms ammunition. The tests were performed on both the\nindividual munition and a package containing a prescribed number\nof items.\nAs noted above, we feel that results from these tests show\nthat off-specification small caliber ammunition up to and including\n0.50 is not \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR ~261.23(a)(6).\nWe, therefore, believe that the disposal of such ammunition is not\nsubject to Subtitle C hazardous waste requirements.\nWe appreciate your cooperation. If you have any questions\nregarding the matter, please call David Friedman or Florence Richardson\nat FTS 382-4770.\ncc: Air &Waste Management Divisions Directors\nRegions I-VI and VIII-X\nRO 12339\n\nATTACHMENT 24\n\n9B A C K G R O U N D D O C U M E N T\nIDEI~T.CIFICATION AND LISTING OF HAZARDWS WASTE\nt3NDER RCRA, SUBTITLE C, SEGTrON 3001\nReactivity Characteristic\n(40 CER 261.23 )\n4xhis document (ms. 1941.25) pxovides background information\nacid suppo~, for EPA's hazardous waste regulations\nU.S. ENVI~NMEI~FrAL PR(7I'ECTIQN AC~NCY\nDiay 1980\nREPRODUCED BY\nU.S. DEPARTMENT Off' COMMERCE\nNATIONAL TECHNICAL\nINFORMATION SERVICE'\nSPRINGFIELD, VA 22161\n\n,~Q\nr\nr\nt\n\nR~'OKf DOCUMENTATION ~ 1.

Section 3001 of that Subtitle requires EPA to\nidenkify the characteristics of and list hazardous wastes.\nWastes identified ox listed as hazardous will be included in\nthe management control system creaCed by Sections 3002-3005\nand 3010. Wastes not identified or listed will be subject to\nthe requirements far non-hazardous waste imposed bq the States\nunder Subtitle D. The Agency has determined that reactivi:v\nis a hazardous character~skic,because improperly managed\nreactive wastes (i.e. , explosives, etc.) pose a substantial\npresent or potential danger to human health and the environment.\nThe purpose of this document is to explain the Agency's\ndefinikion of reactive wastes, to discuss the comments received\non the proposed definition of reactive waste (43 FR 58956,\nDecember 18, 2978) and the changes subsequently made.\nII. Proposed Regulation\nReactive waste. (1) Definition - A solid waste is a\nhazardous waste if a representative sample of the vasCe:~\n(i) Is normally unstable and readily undergoes violent\nchemical change without detonating; reacts violently with\neater, Forms potentially explosive mixtures with water, o-\ngenerates toxic gases, vapors, or fumes when mixed with water;\n-2-\n\nor is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate\ntoxic gases, vapors, ox fumes when exposed to mild acidic or\nbasic conditions.\n(zi) Is capable o~ detonation or expZasive reac~ion but\nrequires a strong initiating source or which must be heated\nunder confinement before initiation can take place, or which\nreacts explosively with water.\n(iii) Is readily capable of detonation ar of explosive\ndecomposition or reaction at normal temperatures and pressuzes.\n(iv) Is a Forbidden explosive as defined in 49 CF R\n173.51, a Class A explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.53, or a\nClass B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.58.\nNOTE --Such waste includes pyrophoric.substances,\nexplosives, autopolymeri'zation material and oxiaizing\nagents. If it i~ not apparent whether a waste is a\nhazardous waste using this description, then the\nmethods cited below or equivalent methods can be used\nko determine if the waste is hazardous waste.\nIdenti~ication method. (1) Thermally unstable waste\ncan he identified using the Explosion Temperature Test cited\nin Appendix II of this Subpart (waste for which explosion,\nignition, ar decomposition occurs at 125\"C after 5 r~nutes is\nclassed as hazardous waste).\n(i) Waste unstable to mechanical shock can be i~entif~ed\n\u2022 using the Bureau of Explosives impact apparatus and the tests\ncited in 49 CFR 173.53 (b), {c), (d}, or {f), as aparooria~e.\n_,~\n\nIII. Rationale for Proposed Regulation\nA. Rationale far proposing a reactivity characteristic\nReactivity was chosen as a characteristic of hazardous\nwastie because improperly managed reactive wastes present a\ndanger to human health and the environment. By definition,\nreactive wastes are those which are capable of violently\ngenerating heat and pressure, reacting vigorously with air or\nwater, reacting with water to generate toxic Fumes, etc. The\ndangers which these wastes pose to transporters, waste disposal\npersonnel, and the public are thus for the most part obvious.\nIn the past, there have been a number of incidents of damage\nto persons or property which have resulted from the improper\nrtanagement of reactive wastes. Sorne of these damage incidents\nare listed and discussed in Appendix I.\nBecause of their acknowledged danger, reactive materials\naxe often controlled by federal and state regulations and\nsuggestions for their safe use or management are oFten\npublished by public or private organizations. Some o\u00a3 these\nfederal and state regulations and the guideline's for reactive\nmaterials prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association\n(NFPA) .are lzsted and discussed in Appendix II.\nB. Rationale for proposed reactivity definition\nReactive substances can be described as those which:\nI) autopolymerize\n2) are unstable with respect to heat or shock\n3) are explosive\n_~-\n\n4) are strong oxidizers\n5) react vigorously with air or Water\n6) react with water to generate toxic fumes\nAs can be seen from this description, Lhe tern \"reac~ivitq\"\nencompasses a diverse and somewhat loosely conjoined class of\nphysical properties or effects. These effects are not mu~ually\nzxclusive and a particulaz substance might exhibit several of\nthe properties mentioned above. For instance, ce::ain\nperoxides would fall into four of the above six ca~egories.\nAdditionally, these categories overlap not only wi:h each\nother, but also with the other characteristics. For exa~~le,\nthe difference between flammability ~confla\u00a2rzCioa} and eti-\nplosiveness (deflagration) is only one ofdegree -- an illustra-\nlion of the fact that the properties enbrac?d by tie terx\n\"reactivity\" are, like the term \"reactivitq\" itse?~, relztive\nproperties which have meaning only in a relative sense.\nThe Agency has aCtempted where possible to de_ine\nhazardous waste characCeristics in terms of speciric,\nnumerically quanti.\u00a3ied properties measurable by standardized\nand available testing protocols. This has aroven 3ifficult\nin the case o~ reactive wastes. The first oroble~ ~:ith\nconstructing a numerically quantified definition cf reactive\nwastes arises from the fact that Che tern \"reacti~ity\" e~~races\na wide variety of different (though overlapping) ~\u00b0sects,\neach of which can be triggered by an eaually Wide variety of\ninitiaCing conditions or forces. IC would 3e cum:?rsome, if\nnot completely impractical, to construct a :\u25bauneri~ally\n_5_\n\nquantified definition which included all these different\neffects and their potential initiating farces. The second\nproblem arises from the Fact, as noted above, that the\npropez~ies embraced by the term reactivity are relative\nproperties. The determination that something \"reacts vigorously\nwith air or water\" or a.s \"unstable with respect to heat or\nshock\" is a relative determination, not an absolute one. The\neffects bezng measured proceed along a continuum. Thus, it\nis ditfi.cult to draw the line at any particular point.\nThese problems are reflected in the testing methods\nwhich might be used to identify reactive substances. These\nmethods suffer from the following generic deficiences:\n1. The available tests are too specific and do not\nreflect the wide variety of waste management\nconditions.\nThe available tests are used to determine how a specific\naspect or manifestation of waste reactivity behaves under a\nspecia]. and specific type of stress. For example, DTA\n(Differential Thermal Analysis) measures how the rate of\ntemperature rise of the waste (one specific aspect of waste\nreactivity.) correJ.ates with the slow input of thermal energy\n(one special and specific type of stress) . This would not\nindicate how the waste reacts to mechanical shock (a drop\ntest would be necessary to determine that); electrical shock,\nwhether the waste is a strong oxidizer, or even what is\nproducing the rate of temperature cYiange (pressure buildup,\ntoxic or nontoxic L-'umes, heat of mixing, etc.). ~'he in~ormation\nderived fxom the available tests; then, is too specialized\n\nand does not reflect the wide varieCy of stresses and initiating\nforces likely to be found in a disposal environment.\n2. Reactivity of a sample may nor reflect reactivity of\nthe whole waste:\nIn the case of wastes which are thermally unstable, the\nreactivity of the sample map not adequately reflect the\nreactivity of the whole Waste. The kinetics of reaction are\nnot only a \u00a3unction of the available initiating sources and\nambient temperature, but are also a function of the mass,\nconfiguration, geometry, etc. of the sample. Foz a \"runaway\"\nreaction to occur, the system must transcend that steady\nsCate where the energy (heat) produced by reaction is equal\nto the energy transferred to the surroundings from the re-\nacting mass. When this critical temperature is reached, the\nmass experiences catastrophic self-heating. This heat\ntransfer phenomena is a tunct~on of sample s1ze, density, and\ngeometry. As demonstxaCed in equation 1:5\nCdtldt QVp exp (-E/RT) + hS (T - To) (1)\nC me (m=mass and c = specific heat)\nT = Temperature of the material\nQ ~ Heat of decoaposition\nV A Volume\np = Aensity\nE Activation energy\nR Gas constant\nh Keat transfer coefficient\nS = Surface are of the material\n_~_\n\nAs can be seen from this equation the rate of temperature\nrise will be affected both by the intensive properties of the\nwaste, such as density, and the expensive properties of the ,\nwaste, such as surface area and geometry. Since the extensive\nproperties o~ the sample are likely to be different from tie\nextensive properties of the whole waste, the reactivity of\nthe sample may not reflect the reactivity of the whole was~e.\n3. The test zesuZts are in most cases subjective or\nnet directly applicable.\nThe ideal test to use in a regulatory program is usually\none which zequires minimal interpretation. 'I~e majority o\u00b0\navailable reactivity testing methods are not o~ the \"nass-\nfail\" type. Rather, these testing methods usually produce\ntest results which consist o\u00a3 a first order differential\nplotted against time or against a standard, from which relative\nreactivity can be assessed. When a test of this sort is run,\nit is not run to determine \"reactivity\" per se 'gut rather ~a\nelicit information concerning how \"fast\" a material reacts\n(i.e. kinetic information) or how vigorously it reacts (thermo-\n3ynamic information). Thus, the decision as to whether a\nwaste is reactive requires subjective interpretation o~ the\ntest results.\nAdditionally, the information derived From such tests\nmay not be directly r~lated~to reactivity. for example, tie\ntest results might provide znformatian on the activateion\nenergy - a useful, but potentially misleading bit of information\nsince it reflects the speed of the reaction rasher than the\n\nreaction's effects. The inapplicabiLitq of some of the rest\nresults emphasizes the indefinite meaning of the term\n\"reacCivity\", a term which draws its meaning \u00a3rom the context\nof its use. A chemist might think of a \"reactive\" subsCance\nas one with a small activa[ion enezgy the energy difference\nbeCween the reactive substance's initial and transition\nstates), i.e., one which reacts easily. The Agency, however,\nunlike the hypothetical chemist, is not just interested in\nthings that react \"easily\" but also i.n~Chings which react\nvigorously. It consequently needs to take into account not\njust the activation energq of a substance but also the heat\no\u00a3 reaction, the molecu~arity o\u00a3 the reaction and a~her ,\nfactors - information which the available tests often do not\nsupply. It is, in other words, not really interested in\nperforming a Chermodynamic measurement, but rather in observing\ni\u00a3 a waste be:~aves in such a wzy as to pose a danger under\nnormal handling conditions.\n4. 'the standardized methods that do exist were not\nc~eveloped for waste testing.\nUse of the available testing methods on waste materials\noften resulCs in the applicaEion of standardized methods to\nnon standardized samples and the application of standardized\nmethods to samples with physical consistencies the method Was\nnat designed for. If such methods are used., the results\nmight be difficult to interpreC with cerCainty.\nThe available reacCi.vity testing methods are individuaLl.y\n-9-\n\ndescribed and evaluated in Appendix 3*. As is evident from\nthose specific evaluations and From the oreceeding discussion\nof the generic shortcomings of the available testing methods,\nnave of these \"type\" methods are suitable for use to\nunequivocally determine if a waste presents a reactive hazard.\nFar essentially the same reasons, a numerically quantified\ndefinition of reactive waste is not feasible. This is not as\nAig a problem as might be thought on initial reflection.\nMost generators whose wastes are dangerous because they are\nreactive are well aware of this property of their waste.\nReactive wastes present special problems in handXing, storage\nand transprot. Also, reactive wastes are rarely generated\nfrom unreactive feed stocks oX in processes producing unreactive\nproducts or intermediates. Furthermore, the problems posed\nby reactive was~es appear to be confine8 to a Fairly narrow\ncategory of wastes. The damage incidents show that the major\nproolems seem to be the formation of hydrogen sulfide (A2S)\nfrom either soluble sulfides or biological degradation o.f\nsulfur containing wastes, the formation of hydrogen cyanide\n(HCN) from soluble cyanides, and the explosion o\u00a3 some\n*These evaluations are taken from \"A Seeond Appraisal of\nMethods for Estimatin Selt Reaction Hazards\", E.

IC will thus onlq be in a\nrare insCance that a generator would be unsure of the reactivity\nclass of the waste, or would be unable Co assess whether the\nwaste fits a prose definition, and would require the application\nof testing p~orocols to determine the reactivity of Chis\nwaste. Since the available testing methods are not ideal\nfor identifying those wastes cateQoriz~d as hazardous due to\nreactivity, the approach chosen is to prescribe a.prose\ndescription of reactive waste far self-determination bq\ngenerators and to list wastes which meet this description and\nh ave been identified as reacCive.\nThe prose definition chosen is a paraphrase of the top\nthree of the reactive classes of the National Fire Protection\nassociation ~NFPA) reactivity classification system. The\nother two classes in the NFPA classification scheme are not\nincluded since Chese would include materials which are inert\nunder normal handling conditions. This definition is used\nbecause it includes all aspecks and types o~ reactivity which\npresent a danger* and is already Familiar to persons handling\nreactive materials. The Chemical Manufacturers Associativnl\nuses this definition to classify reactive wastes in its\n\"LaboraCory Waste disposal Manual\". Also., a paraphrase of\nthis classificaCion system is used by the Navyz in.kheir\nhazardous waste disposal guide and is used in other hazardous\nmaterials handing guides 3~4 as a classification sysCem.\n*All wasCes which have been identified as having caused\ndamage are identified under this definition as are all\ncommonly defined types of reactivity.\n-11-\n\nFurthermore, the States of California and Okl~~oma use this\nsystem to define reactive wastes.\n-12-\n\nReferences\n1. \"Laboratory Waste Disposal Manual\" Chemical Manufacturers\nAssociation (19.75).\n2. \"NEPSS Hazardous Aaste Disposal Guide\", naval Environ-\naental Protection Support Service (1976).\n3. \"Handling Guide for Potentially Ha~atdaus Katerials\",\nMaterial Sa\u00a3ety Management Inc.

Comments Received on the Proposed ~aracteristics\nand the Agency's Response to These Comments\nThe Agency received approximately forty comment letters\naddressing reactivity. These letters contained approximately\nsixty discrete recommendations or comrr.~n~s on tre proposed\nregulation (in some letters more than one point was addressed).\nSeveral of the commenters \u00a3elt that the proposed reactivity\ndefinition was adequate and pznvides dssirable flexibility\nfor the generator to. use judgement. A~wever, the large\nmajority o\u00a3 comments expressed concern with the Agency's\nreactivity characteristic. These cominen~s have been categorized\nby either contend or the portion of tre regulation addressed.\nA discussion of these follows:\nA. A large majority of the comments ~eal~ with the asserted\nlack of spee~fic~ty and ambiguity of tze prose definition.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued t~a~ the prose definition\nemployed by the Agency is, as a General mater, too\nvague and should be replaced by ~ numerically quanti-\nfied definition accompanied by aparopriate testing\nprotocols. This comment leas beer_ fully addressed in\nPart III above and need not be ac3ressed further here.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued ~z~t the inclusion in\nthe definition of wastes which \"Generate toxic gases,\nvapors, ox fumes when mixed wi`.~ water\" and of \"cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes] wn~~~. can generate toxic\ngases, vapors, oz fumes when e~~~s.e3 to mild acidic\n-14-\n\nor basic conditions\" needs to be made amore specific.\nSeveral of the commenters suggested that a phrase\nsuch as \"in harmful quantita.es\" be irse~tec into the\nproposed regulat~.ons as follows: \"...or ger_erates\ntoxic gases, vapors, or fumes in harnful aLantities\nwhen mixed with water\"; \"or is a cya~i~e or sulfide\nbearing waste which can generate toxic gases, vapors,\nor fumes in harmful quantities when exposed to mild .\nacidic or basic conditions.\" The comments on the\ncyanide and sulfide bearing. wastes all poi.^.fed out\nthat everything contains sulfides anc r,.ost =kings\ncontain cyanides (albeit in trace amoun~s) ~n3 many\no\u00a3 these can generate minute quai:tities of 1y3r~gen\nsulfide or hydrogen cy~nic~e under mildly acidi..c or\nbasic conditions. The Agency is sym~~.~:zeti^ ~o these\nconceicns, and, in antici.pata.on of such. orob'_e~s, had\nattempted to make clear in the preamble and background\ndocuments that khe Agency was leavi,na the determination\nof reactivity hazard up to the reasonable ~idc~ement\nof the generator based upon the generator's past\nexperience with the waste. Taka.ng t'nis coffin sense\napproach, such material as soil or flyash w~~.:~ suicides\n.contamination (examples of sulfide an3 ~yan~de bearing\nwastes supplied by the commenters) woul3 cls~,~ly rot\nmeet the reactivity definition. D~spit~ th'_s, the\npoint made by tY~e commenters is certainly v=lid. ^here-\nfore, so that there will be no confus=on; t::~ r~gen~y has\n-15-\n\nchanged the final regulation to make it more specific, as\nfollows: \"...or generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes:\nin quantities sufficient to preszrt a danger to public ,\nhealth or the environment when mixed with water; or is a\ncyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate toxic\ngases, vapors or fumes in quantities sufficient to pxesent a\ndanger to public health or the environment when exposed. ..\"\nThis would certainly better reflect our regulatory intent.\nA number of commenters advocated that the Agency specify\nwhat is meant by mildly acidic or basic conditions. One\ncommenter specified a pH range (5 to 9'), but offered no\nrationale as to why this particular range should be used.\nSince a 5ubstantal percentage of the commenters found the\nphrase \"m~idTy acidic or basic\" to be rather nebulous, the\nAgency has decided that a specific p~ range should be speei-\nfeed. The pH range chosen is thaw w'~ich is considered non-\nhazardous by the corrosivity charac~eristic (2 < pH <12.5).\n'Phis range was chosen because any li\u2022~uid outside the range\nis hazardous and requires management within the Subtitle C\nregulations. Only liquid wastes inside this range can be\nlandfilled without regard to the strictures on compatibility\nimposed by the Subtitle C regulations and co-disposed with\nwastes containing soluble cyanides or sulfides. These are\nthen the most stringent pH cvnditio~s which a waste could be\nsubjected to outside of a Subtitle C Facility. (natural\nwaters are unlikely to be outside this pH range).\n-16-\n\n\u00b0 Several commenters suggested that the definition of\ncyanide bearing waste should distinguish between \"\u00a3xee\ncyanide\" and ferro cyanide\" since the latter would not\nbe available to generate hydrogen cyanide under mild\nacidic or basic conditions. Thp Agency beleives that\nsuch a clarification is nat necessary. If the cyanide\nis unavailable under the s~eci\u00a3ied acidic or basic\nconditions then toxic hydrogen cyanide fumes cannot he\ngenerated and the wastes containing these unavailable\ncyanides are not reackive. To s~ec~fy these as exemp-\ntions would be redundant and by implication might lead\ngenerators to conclude that other unavailable sulfides\nor cyanides NOT specifically exempted, do neet the\nreactivity chazacteristic.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated~speci~ying the cancen-\ntration of sulfide or cyanide needed to make cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes hazardous. As explained above,\nthe identity of wastes which generate toxic gases under\nthe conditions specified in the ~efinition~should be\nobvious to the generator and thus, this level o\u00a3 sophi-\nstication~is unnecessary.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency specify a\nrate of evolution of toxic gas, but included no sugges-\ntions as to how to do so. The tigency is unsure of how\na laboratory test method measuring gas evolution rate\n-17-\n\ncould be developed which could then be neaning`ully\nrelated to field conditions. Therefore, an evoluticn\nrate of toxic gas will not be included in the final\nregulations.\n\u00b0 One commenter argued that sulfides and cyanides should\nnot be singled out in-the regula4ians and further\nskated that all other poCential Toxic fume generators\nbe included or, alternatively, that no toxic fume gen\u2014\nerators be included. The Agency disagrees. According\nto information which the Agency has in its possession\n(see Appendix F), the primary wastes implicated in the\ngeneration of Coxic gas are su?f'_des and cyanides. Thus,\nthe Agency would be remiss if it did not speci_`y these\ntypes of wastes. If others are identified, :hey will\nbe included also.\nB. A number of commenters argued that the test protocols\nproposed in 5ecti.on 250.13 (c)C2) of the regulations were\nexpensive, unreliable and nak specific enough. Additionaliq,\nseveral ocher commenters had problems wiCh specific test\nprotocols. For instance, same commenters argued t~a.t the\n125\u00b0C temperature adopted for the Explosion Tempera~ure Test\nwas not a reasonable temperature and hat decomposi=ion, a~\nused in this test, needs to be defined.)\nAs a result of some preli.ninary cork undertakes 3y k`e\nAgency on khe explosion Temperature 7es~* and after :evie~ n~\n*Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?:acedures aa3 ~arieus\nHazard Ldentification Tests (Final ~eoort)\", NUS C~roora~ion,\nSeptember, 1979, (see Appendix IV).\n\u201418--\n\nthe comments received on these test pTOtgCO~S* (and in ciew of the\ngenetic problems with such tests, discussed above and.iz ~ppen3i~\nIII), the Agency has decided tp remove Lhe test ~rotoco?s from\n\u00a7261.23 of the regulations. The A~encq agrees in general that\ntheq are are unsuitable in defining a \"reactive\" waste ;or RCR~\nregulatory purvoses. T.he A~encY has accordingly zemoved the des-\nignated test protocols from the regulations except to tie extent\nthaC the DepartmenC of Transportation's definiCion of C1ass.A\nexplosives requires use of the shock instability test. As a rzsult\nof this decision, the Agency does not believe it is necessary to\ndiscuss the individual concerns on the various test pro~ocols.\nC. A number of commenters argued that only under land=ill coa-\nditions will a waste be subjected to strong initiating sources\nor heated ander canfinemant. Therefore, they stated [hat since\nno landFillin~ of explosive waste is permitted, these conditions\nwill never occur and Section 25Q.13(c}C1}iii) is unnecessary.\nThis argument is completely circular. If Section 250.13\nCc)(1)(ii) were removed from Che re~ula4ions, exalosive Wastes\nwould not be considered hazardous and c'ould be disposed of in\na sanitary landfill, thus subiectin~ Che castes to the very\nconditions which the commenters contend will cause the waste\nto explode'.

A number of commenters advocated exe~ptin~ emergency\nsituations i.e., homemade bombs) from coverage of RCRA so\nthat emergency Ceams can dispose Qf these explosive materials\nas expeditiously as possible without delay (i.e. , without\nrequiring a manifest, etc.) .\nThe regulation already makes acco~~odation for cases of\nimminent hazard in 5263.30. Thus, emergency handling of\nexplosive wastes would be exempted by this section.\nE. Other Comments\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated that all the character-\nistics 'be made as flexible as the reactiviCy character-\nistic.\nThe Agency disagrees with these commenCs; the broad\nmeaning and generic character of the reactivity \"uni-\nverse\" requires a flexible characteristic. The Agency\nwould have preferred Co define reactivity by speC~fic\ntest pro[ocols. However, this is not possible. Thy\nother character~sitics, (except imitable solids) can\nbe delineated o..r gauged by measurzmeat of one Cor a\nfew) specific chemical/physical ~roverties; therefore,\nthe Agency will continue to define the ignitable.\ncorrosive, and toxicity characteristic as proposed.\n-~0-\n\n\u00b0 Ong commenter argued that just because a was~e may\nundergo a violent chemical change with another waste\n~s no reason to consider a waste hazardous. To illu-\nstrate this point, the commenter pointed out tha~ an\nacid and base when mixed will undezgo vio~en~ chemical\nchange, but that such mixing (ne~~~.ralization) is a\nnecessary part of many treatment systems an3 should\nnot be prohibited.\nThe Agency believes this commenter to be under a mis-\napprehension about the scope of the reactivi~y d~\u00a3i-\nnition. The definition of reactivity refers to wastes\nwhich undergo violent change in an uncontrol'ed ~:anner\neither by themselves, or when mixed with water. There-\nfore, the example o~ neutralization given by the commen.~er\nis inanpropria~e, in as much as that example invalves ~~e\nmixing of wastes. Furthermore, tie Agency does ~.o~\nbelieve that the example given Uy the commencer is a fair\nrepresentation of the hazards posed by wastes caoabLe\nof undergoing a violent chemical change. 'Lhe exartple\ngiven involves the controlled interaction he~ween two\nwastes which is a treatment technique and. thLs dies not\nreflect the hazards presented by uncontrolled violent\nchemical change characteristic o\u00a3 waste mana~eme~t\nsituaeions.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the definition. o~ zsactive\nwaste be subdivided into sections which mig:~~ be later\n-21_\n\nindexed into a compatibility chart.\nThe primary purpose of Section 3001 is to identify\nhazardous Wastes, and not to dictate management tech-\npiques. Section 3004 will address the various management\nCechniques including incompatible wastes ~se.e X265.17\nof the regulations). An appendix to the regulations\n(Appendix 5 in Part 265) is provided with just such infor-\nmatron.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency allow a genera -\nfor to use any tesk that is believed appropriate \u00a3or\ndetermining reacCivity. Similarly, one commenter\nsuggested that Appendix III to this background document\nbe removed because it might discourage ase of a su~Cable\ntest.\nThis comment must be evaluated zn Light of the\nAgency's decision not to prescribe any tesCs nor mea-\nsuria~ reactivity. Ordinarilq, when the Agency pre-\nscribes a specific test for measuring a characteristic,\nthe generator is free to employ a different test if he\ncan demonstrate, in accordance with the equivalency\nprocedurees set forth in Subpart E, that his test is\nequivalent to the Agency -prescribed test. 5z~ce Che\nagency has elected not to prescribe any test protocols\nfor measuring reactivity, the question 'of equivivalent\ntest methods is largely mooted: test results are no\nlonger determinative of whether a waste is reac~ive\nand there is nothing against which to measure equivalency.\n\u20142Z'\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the use of tests by\nthe generators is precluded. The generator is \u00a3xee\nto conduct any tests which aid him in assessing whether\nhis waste fits within the prose definition of reactivity.\nHowever, the Agency is not bound in any way by these\ntests and will make its assessment of whether a wasCe\nis reactive by reference to the prose definition.\nIf a generator devises a rest method which he be-\nIieves adequatelq measures the reactivity of a waste, he\nshould submit that Cest method to the Agency nor evalua-\nlion.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the agency address reacti-\nvity over time in the \u2022definition since a material maq\nundergo physical and chemical changes as it ages and\nbecome extremely reactive, whereas it might not be\nreactive when first generated.\nThe Agency agrees with the commenter Chao some\nmaterials, such as certain ethers, can become more re-\nactive with time. However, the Agency has no information\n(such as damage incidents) concerning any wastes which\nmight present this type of preblem. Additionally, khe\nAgency is not aware of any testing method by which such\nwastes might be identified. Therefore, the final regula-\nlion will not address reactivity over time per se; as\nChese wastes are identified by the Agency then mill be\nlisted in Subpart D of Part 261 of the regulations.\n-23-\n\nOne commencer objected to the Agency defining as reactive\nthose wastes which are capable of detonation or explosive\nreaction i\u00a3 subjected to a strong initiating source or\nheated under confinement. The commenter asserted that\nmany inert, non-reactive materials, including Cap Water,\ncan be triggered to detonate or explode under confinement\nwhen subjected to strong, heat, pressure, or a combinaCion\nof these and other initiating sources.\nThe Agencq disagrees with this commenter and rakes\nspecific issue with Che assertion thzt mane relatively\ninert substances could be made to explode when subjec^\nted to extreme heat and pressure. Ia any event, even\nif relatively inert substances could be made to explode\nwhen subjected to str~ttg heat and pressure, these sub-\n.stances would noC be considered reactive under the pro-\nposed definition. The Ageney is only concerned with\nsubstances capable of exploding under reasonable confine-\nwent conditions -- i.e., those confiae~ent conditions\nlikely to be encountered in disposal environments.\nV; Promulgated Regulations\nAs a result of EPA's review of the conaents regarding\nthe rea'ctivi'ty characteristic, EPA is promuL~ating a reactivity\ncharacteristic which significantly differs `rim ~~e proposed\nzegulations in two aspects: the thermal instability and shock\ninstability Cest protocols cited in the pro?osed regulation\nhas been removed and the section relaCive to generation o\u00a3\ntoxic gas, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sul`ide has been\n-24-\n\nmade amore svecific.

We are not at this time able to make a\ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a\nwide range of products exhibit the characteristic of reactivity. It remains the\nresponsibility of the generator of any particular waste to make this determination (see\n40 CFR 262.11). However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount\nof liquid (e.g., a can that has been punctured and drained) would meet the definition of\nscrap metal (40 CFR 261.1(c)(6)), and, if it is to be recycled, would be exempt from\nregulation under 40 CFR 261.6 (a)(3)(iv). Scrap metal that is recycled is exempt from\nRCRA regulation under this provision even if it is hazardous waste, so generators need\nnot make a hazardous waste determination. Scrap metal that is not recycled, however,\nis subject to the hazardous waste regulations if it is hazardous, so generators must make\na hazardous waste determination.\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

Bergeson\nWeinberg, Sergeson, and Neuman\n1300 Eye Street, N.W.\nSuite 1000 West\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nDear Ms. Bergeson:\nThank you for your letter of October 14, 1994 requesting clarification of the regulatory\nrequirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) applicable to the collection,\ntransportation and recycling of spent antifreeze generated at automobile service centers, in particular, at\nwhat point spent antifreeze becomes a solid waste.\nThis request was posed in order in the context of a spent antifreeze recycling program, wherein\nspent antifreeze generated from radiator flushes done at automobile service centers (specifically,\nValvoline Instant Oil Change stores) is collected, stored and sent for recycling at Union Carbide's\nGlycol Recovery Unit in Institute, West Virginia. The specific questions you raised relate to the\npractical difficulties of generating and characterizing spent antifreeze, where one radiator flush may be\nhazardous and the next flush nonhazardous. Please forgive the delay in responding to your request.\nThe following discussion of the RCRA regulations applicable to the spent antifreeze recycling\nprogram that your clients, Union Carbide Corporation and Ecogard, Inc., plan to establish comes after\ncareful consideration of this recycling program and extensive phone conversations between Tom\nOvenden and my staff.\nAt this time, EPA has not determined what point of generation will be applied to \"like wastes\"\n(wastes of a similar composition) through any future Agency rulemakings. As you know, the Agency\nhas solicited comment in its Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) Phase III proposed rule on different\noptions to designating the point of generation for like-wastes. See 60 FR 11702, 11715-11717\n(March 2, 1995). The three specific options presented in the preamble would view the collection of\nmany streams as a single waste for purposes of identifying a point of generation.\nFaxBack # 14003\n\nAs an alternative to designating a point of collection of many streams, the Agency could\nestablish a point of generation for like-wastes upstream of the collection point of like-wastes (e.g., an\nautomotive radiator in the case of spent anti-freeze). However, at least with respect to anti-freeze, we\nare not certain that this represents the most practical way to approach antifreeze management when\nanti-freeze is routinely aggregated and collected in drums and tanks and the characteristic of the\nantifreeze in those containers is the best indicator of potential environmental risks if the material were\nreleased to the environment.\nGiven the facts of the situation, we also realize that it would be impractical to require each\nindividual radiator flush to be tested for a hazardous characteristic. We also realize that assuming that\neach radiator flush is characteristically hazardous may limit the volume of spent antifreeze that\nautomobile service centers will store and this make available for recycling and, ultimately, may impact on\nthe cost-effectiveness of the overall spent antifreeze recycling program.\nBearing this in mind, even if the Agency were to determine that the point of generation should be\nat the radiator, we believe that it would be appropriate for a generator to rely on \"knowledge\" of the\nwaste (as per 40 CFR 262.11(c) (2)) based on studies done to characterize the frequency of\n\"hazardous\" spent antifreeze generated (relative to the generation of \"nonhazardous\" spent arrtifreeze), in\norder to characterize the total volume of hazardous waste generated. Study data. may also be used to\ncharacterize the consolidated volume of spent antifreeze. As you cite in your letter, data. collected by\nvarious parties indicate that up to 40 % of the spent antifreeze flushed from radiators may be hazardous,\nprimarily due to lead. Thus, the Agency believes that, absent facility-specific data. to the contrary, it\nwould be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total consolidated volume of\nspent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60%nonhazardous. Note, however, that\nfacility-specific data. gathered by spent antifreeze generators or authorized regulating agencies could\noverride this 40% presumption and show higher or lower percentages of hazardous wastes.\nThis use of \"knowledge\" of the wastestreams, as applied to the total volume of spent antifreeze\ngenerated, would be an appropriate alternative to testing the spent antifreeze. And, just to clarify, this\napproach would be appropriate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the\npurposes of being eligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators.\nWe agree with you that commingling \"40% hazardous\" spent antifreeze with \"60%\nnonhazardous\" spent antifreeze in a common tank or container by the generator prior to the recycling of\nthe spent antifreeze (and the subsequent treatment and disposal of the residues from recycling in\ncompliance with Part 268) would not constitute impermissible dilution under 40 CFR 2683. Given that\nthis mixing would be done to facilitate proper treatment \u2014recycling and subsequent treatment which\ndestroys, removes or immobilizes hazardous constituents before land disposal \u2014the dilution would not\nbe impermissible.\nIn response to your inquiries regarding the application of the dilution prohibition to the burning of\nmetal-bearing wastes and the burning of the still bottom residues of the spent antifreeze recycling\nprocess, the Agency would consider the still bottoms to be newly generated wastes. Assuming that the\n\nstill bottoms were hazardous, they could appropriately be burned for energy recovery in a regulated unit\nprovided that they have sufficient BTU value. Therefore, the Agency would not consider the burning of\nthe metal-bearing/high BTU bottoms to be impermissible dilution.\nAs for your inquiries regarding the applicable notifications and certifications for the purposes of\nthe land disposal restrictions, insofar as the generator mixes hazardous and nonhazardous spent\nantifreeze such that the resultant mixture is no longer hazardous and meets the applicable treatment\nstandards, the generator must comply with the notification and certification requirements of section\n268.9.\nIn summary, 'the Agency were to determine the radiator to be the point of generation for spent\nanti-freeze, we believe that one possible scenario for the spent antifreeze program is where an\nautomobile service center could commingle each individual radiator flush in a tank or container,\nassuming (absent facility-specific data. to the contrary) for the purposes of waste characterization and\nquantity of hazardous waste generated that 40% of the total volume generated in a month is hazardous\n(D008). The generator could also consider the accumulated total volume of spent antifreeze to be\nnonhazardous.\nThe generator would comply with the one-time notification and certification requirements of\nsection 268.9(d). And, because the commingled mixture of the spent antifreeze is no longer hazardous,\nno hazardous waste manifest would be required.\nThe recycler receiving the nonhazardous spent antifreeze would not require a hazardous waste\nstorage permit or be subject to other hazardous waste management requirements for this wastestream.\nThe recycler should characterize any residues from the distillation/recycling of spent anti freeze\nto determine if they are hazardous wastes. If any of the residuals are hazardous, the recycler must\ncomply with the applicable land disposal restrictions requirements of Part 268 (e.g., notification and\ncertification).\nAssuming, as discussed in your letter, that the residues are hazardous metal-bearing/high BTU\nwastes, these residues may be transported (with a hazardous waste manifest, and land disposal\nrestrictions notification) to a permitted hazardous waste combustion unit for treatment. The final\ntreatment facility would certify compliance with the applicable treatment standards prior to disposal of\nthe residues. You should note, however, that this would be pursuant to the Federal regulatory program.\nAs you know, States that are authorized for RCRA program may have more stringent requirements.\n\nThank you for your interest in the development of a recycling program to manage a common,\nand somewhat problematic, wastestream in an environmentally sound manner.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\n\nATTACHMENT 27\n\nStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA's Regulatory Framework\nSeptember 12, 2016\nI. Introduction\nA. Background\nRegulation of hazardous waste generated by the retail sector under the federal Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act (RCRA) presents unique challenges that are not found in more \"traditional\" RCRA- regulated\nindustries. The retail sector as a whole handles a very large number of diverse products', which change over time\nand may, in many instances, become regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA when discarded 2. As a result,\nretailers are required to make hazardous waste deternvnations for a variety of products at stores located across the\ncountry.\nAdditionally, the reverse distribution 3 process where retail stores generally send unused goods to reverse logistics\ncenters and rely upon arrangements with suppliers/vendors 4 to determine the ultimate disposition of these goods is\nawell-established business practice in the retail sector. Nevertheless, how the reverse distrbution processes is\nregulated, or should be regulated, under RCRA has resulted in a number of questions from both retailers and\nregulators. This issue becomes more complicated for retail chains with store locations in many different states,\nwhere states have taken various positions on how RCRA regulations apply.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) began a review of how RCRA hazardous\nwaste regulations apply to the retail sector in order to better understand challenges in complying with RCRA\nregulations. EPA's review consisted of discussions with various members of the retail community and states\nthrough meetings, conferences and site visits.\nOn January 11, 2011, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO)13563 regarding the retrospective review of\nregulations, which required federal agencies such as EPA to develop a plan to \"...determine whether any such\nregulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's regulatory\nprogram more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.\"\nEPA published a Notice of Data Availability (NODA) for the Retail Sector, dated February 14, 2014 (79 FR\n8926) as part of the Agency's continuing efforts to better understand concerns from all stakeholders regarding\nRCRA's applicability to the retail sector, as well as to obtain information and feedback on issues affecting the\nretail sector. The NODA was also intended to satisfy EPA's corrunitment under this EO to solicit public comment\non issues associated with the retail sector. Additional information regarding the NODA is presented in Section\nII.A.\n1 Although the terms \"products\"and\"goods\" are used and generally described at times as \"items\"or \"materials\" in this document, use of\nthese terms is not intended to indicate if or when such items/materials become wastes either at the store or during the reverse distribution\nprocess.\n2 The term discarded is defined at 40 CFR 261.2(a)(2). When a material, such as a retail item, is discarded is a key question because, once\na decision to discard is made, the material becomes a solid waste and the person making this decision is a generator of solid waste. At\nsuch point and time, the generator would be required to make a hazardous waste determination.\n3 EPA is aware that the term \"reverse distribution\" is often used for pharmaceuticals, whereas \"reverse logistics\" is used for non-\npharmaceuticals); however, the former term appears throughout this document and is intended to apply to all retail items under this\nprocess.\n^ The terms \"supplier\"and \"vendor\" (latter more commonly used in the retail industry) appearmore often in this document, as compared\nto\"manufacturer,\" since it is more likely the flow ofgoods/products occurs between retailers and suppliers/vendors (or agents thereof,\nalthough suppliers themselves may also be manufacturers or product formulators.\n\nEPA's ongoing outreach efforts, combined with the comments received on the NODA, have improved the\nAgency's understanding of the challenges arising when managing unused/intact consumer goods that have\nbecome unsalable at retail stores and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\nB. Objective\nEPA's considerable engagement with the retail sector and regulators to date has resulted in development of this\nstrategy, which lays out a cohesive plan to address the unique challenges faced by the retail sector in complying\nwith RCRA regulations while reducing burden and protecting human health and the environment.\nIn crafting this strategy, EPA recognizes that RCRA regulations, which were developed primarily for\nmanufacturing settings, are not necessarily the best fit for the retail sector. EPA is also aware that the Agency has,\nin the past, made efforts to tailor RCRA regulations to address certain types of unique waste management\ncircumstances (e.g., used oil, universal wastes, spent lead-acid batteries, academic laboratory waste).\nEPA further recognizes that there are occasions when unused/inta.ct consumer goods, including customer returns,\ncannot be sold by the original retailer for a variety of reasons such as mandatory or voluntary recalls, seasonal\nchanges, overstock and expired shelf-life.\nFinally, the Agency is taking into account retail sector practices already in place, such as the reverse distrbution\nprocess, to promote sustainability by ensuring that retail items remain marketable as commodities for donation or\nliquidations, thus reducing the amount of waste generated and encouraging recycling of wastes that are generated,\nas opposed to being disposed as solid or hazardous waste. b\nWith this in mind, our strategy consists of athree-pronged approach, which is further discussed in Sections III and\nIV of this document:\n1. Issue Agency policy, guidance and rulemaking to ensure a better fit between RCRA regulations and the retail\nsector.\n2. Research retail hazardous waste management practices and related issues in the area of reverse distrbution,\nuniversal waste and other challenges.\n3. Using the results of our evaluation and research, identify additional approaches to address outstanding RCRA\nretail sector issues if needed.\nII. Identification ofRetail Sector Issues\nA. Retail NODA\nThe objectives of the 2014 Retail NODA were to share information EPA had collected and, more importantly, to\nobtain additional information that would allow the Agency to better understand and address issues encountered by\nindustry and regulators with respect to the application of RCRA regulations, guidance and policy to the retail\nsector.\nIn the NODA, EPA requested comment on a series of topics related to retail operations, waste management\npractices and management of materials that may become hazardous waste when discarded. This specifically\nincluded requests for information regarding aerosol cans (e.g., quantity generated, classification and management\n5 The term \"liquidation\" (also known as salvage) is used in this document to describe sale of products on the secondary market for use by\nconsumers.\nRoutine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials, as well as the occurrence of damaged/leaking products no longer\nconsidered commodities and \"unknowns\"(item contents cannot be identified), also result in waste generation.\n2\n\noptions, including handling as universal waste), since aerosol cans comprise a large percentage of the retail\nsector's hazardous waste stream. The NODA comment period closed on May 30, 2014.\nEPA received comments from 44 stakeholders, with comments consisting of feedback from: (1) companies\nconsisting primarily of retailers [nine commenters]; (2) industry/trade Associations [nine commenters]; (3)\ngovernment and related organizations [seven commenters]; (4) recyclers [three commenters]; (5) waste\nmanagement and treatment, storage and disposal facilities [three commenters]; (6) law firms [three commenters];\n(7) reverse logistics provider [one commenter] and (8) anonymous [nine commenters]. The NODA and supporting\ndocuments, along with comments on the NODA, are available at http://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-\nwaste-management-and-reta il-sector.\nB. Summary of Comments on Retail NODA\nAs part of developing this strategy, EPA has reviewed all NODA comments to identify stakeholder\nissues/concerns, including suggestions on how to better address the retail sector under RCRA. Feedback from\nNODA commenters reinforced EPA's understanding that the retail sector differs from the\nindustriaUmanufacturing sector in the following key respects:\n\u2022 Large number of stores in many locations handling consumer goods that, in many situations, could become\nhazardous waste upon discard\n\u2022 Numerous varieties of goods, which are generally manufactured by someone else and whose ingredients are\noften not fully known, make hazardous waste determinations difficult\n\u2022 Unpredictable quantity of waste generation due to episodic generation (e.g., recalls and customer returns)\n\u2022 Hazardous waste training at the store level is difficult due to high employee turnover\n\u2022 Use of the reverse distribution process to manage unsalable products \u2014including those that become hazardous\nwaste when discarded\nEPA gouped suggestions from NODA commenters into the following major categories (approximate percentage\nof commenters suggesting a particular approach is shown in parentheses)':\n\u2022 Address Pharmaceuticals (42%)\no Remove P-listing for nicotine -containing products (23%)\no Manage as Universal Wastes (17%)\n\u2022 Endorse Reverse Distribution Retail Paradigm \u2014encompasses point of generation and waste determination\nissues (40%)\no Exclude Retail Goods Managed under the Reverse Distribution Process from the Definition of Solid\nWaste (15%)\nExpand Universal Waste Regulations to Other Waste Categories\no Aerosol Cans (35%)\no Pesticides (19%)\no Electronics (17%)\no All Retail GoodsB (14%)\n\u2022 Provide Flexibility for Episodic Generation and Hazardous Waste Quantity Determinations (19%)\n\u2022 Exclude Retail Goods as Household Hazardous Waste/Expand \"Household Hazardous Waste\" Exemption\n(10%)\n\u2022 Revise and Update Satellite Accumulation Area Requirements (9%)\nEPA identified the following additional NODA commenter suggestions that did not fall into major categories:\n~ Universal waste percentages include instances where certain items (pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics) were\nidentified individually and where retail goods as a whole were mentioned.\n8 Assumed to include, but would not necessarily be limited to, pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics.\n\n\u2022 Determine the actual extent of the retail sector \"universe\" in terms of the numbers of retailers, types of retail\nitems handled and amount of wastes generated, as well accurately designating generator categories (i.e., la.rge\nquantity, small quantity and conditionally exempt small quantity generators).\n\u2022 Coordinate with other federal agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation and Food and Drug\nAdministration) when issuing guidance/policy or developing regulations that may affect management of\nmaterials/wastes in the retail sector in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts or duplication of effort.\n\u2022 Clarify the Agency's position regarding whether aerosol cans are considered a reactive hazardous waste.\nConduct outreach activities such as identifying/providing opportunities for training and offering compliance\nassistance.\n\u2022 Support use of e-Manifest and other electronic means of documenting compliance with RCRA regulations.\n\u2022 Recog~vze challenges associated with waste management under differing state regulations.\n\u2022 Eliminate the requirement for large quantity generators to store ignitable or reactive waste at least fifty feet\nfrom the facility's properly line.\nTo the extent they are not already being addressed through policy, guidance and rulemaking or other EPA actions,\nthe Agency will consider the aforementioned issues as part of implementing this strategy.\nIII. Response to Household Hazardous Waste Exemption NODA Comments\nSome NODA commenters suggested that EPA expand the \"household hazardous waste\" exclusion at 40 CFR\n261.4(b)(1) to include either retail goods as a whole or certain types of retail goods. The Agency has already\naddressed this issue as part of a previous rulemaking that responded, in part, to a petition from the American\nRetail Federation (ARF).\nAs explained in a final November 13, 1984 rule (49 FR 44978), EPA excluded household hazardous waste\nbecause the legislative history of RCRA indicated an intent to exclude such wastes and not because these wastes\ncan never pose the risks associated with hazardous wastes. Additionally, consistent with legislative history, EPA\ndetermined that it was necessary to establish two criteria that must be met to qualify for this exclusion when\nevaluating ARF's petition. First, the waste must be generated by individuals on the premises of a temporary or\npermanent residence and, second, the waste stream must be composed primarily of materials found in wastes\ngenerated by consumers in their homes. In this final rule, EPA denied ARF's petition to exempt consumer\nhousehold products from retail sources because these wastes fail to meet both criteria. EPA continues to believe\nthat retail goods, including those that could become wastes when discarded, do not satisfy the criteria for this\nexclusion.\nIV. Current EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nPrior to issuing the NODA in 2014, EPA had already begun developing the Pharmaceuticals rule (staring in 2009)\nand the Generator Improvements rule (starting in 2011), as well as the Definition of Solid Waste (DSW) rule.\nBecause pharmaceutical hazardous waste is a large part of the retail sector's RCRA concerns, EPA mentioned in\nthe NODA that the Agency was developing a proposed rule for healthcare facility-specific management standards\nfor hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (the Pharmaceuticals rule).\nAlthough, for the most part, it was not possible to address all the feedback received on the NODA in these\nrulemakings, EPA has tried to incorporate approaches in these rulemakings to address some of the NODA\ncomments in order to ease the burden of managing hazardous wastes in a retail setting. A discussion of these\nefforts is provided below:\nA. DSW Rule\nThe final DSW rule, dated January 13, 2015 (80 FR 1694), provides new conditional exclusions for hazardous\nsecondary materials. If these materials are managed according to specified conditions, legitimately recycled and\nsent to a verified recycler, they would not be regulated as a solid waste. Retailers may be able to use tivs\n4\n\nexclusion for recycling aerosol cans and possibly other retail items. Additional information on this final\nrulemaking is available at httpJ/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/final-rule-201.5-definition-solid-waste-dsw.\nEPA is coordinating with stakeholders and conducting outreach activities in order to implement and monitor\neffectiveness ofthe final DSW rule.\nB. Ge ne rator Improve ments Rule\nThe proposed Generator Improvements rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 57018), advances approaches for\naddressing a number of issues facing the hazardous waste generator community, including the following issues\nrelevant to the retail sector:\n\u2022 Provides flexibility for episodic generators of hazardous waste.\n\u2022 Allows consolidation of conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste at large quantity generators.\n\u2022 Permits waiver of the 50-foot buffer requirement for ignitable/reactive wastes under certain conditions.\nEPA plans to finalize this rule in fall 2016. Additional information on this rule is available at\nhttpl/www. epa. gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-hazardous-waste-generator-improvements.\nC. Pharmaceuticals Rule\nThe proposed Pharmaceuticals rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 58014), addresses a number of retailer\nRCRA concerns. The proposed rule:\n\u2022 Advances an approach so that a healthcare facility, including a retailer with a pharmacy, who generates 1 kg\nof acute P-listed hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a calendar month will not become the most stringently\nregulated generator (a large quantity generator).\n\u2022 Sets forth a tailored set of management standards specifically designed to reduce the complexity and\nregulatory burden of the RCRA hazardous waste regulations for the management of hazardous waste\npharmaceuticals by health care facilities, including hospitals, clinics and retail stores with pharmacies.\n\u2022 Provides regulatory clarity on how the reverse distrbution of pharmaceuticals is regulated under RCRA.\n\u2022 Explores two possible approaches in the rule to address concerns with designating nicotine -containing\nsmoking cessation products (e.g., gums, lozenges and patches) and other low-concentration nicotine-\ncontaining products as acutely hazardous (P-listed) wastes. For both approaches, EPA requested toacicity data.\nfor nicotine (P075). The two regulatory options are: (1) a narrow exemption from the P075 listing for Food\nand Drug Administration -approved over-the-counter smoking cessation products (patches, gums, and\nlozenges) and (2) broader, concentration -based approach to listing nicotine (P-listing for high concentrations\nand U-listing for low concentrations, similar to the approach taken for warfarin.\n\u2022 Requests comment in the rule preamble on whether e-cigarettes and nicotine -containing liquids for e-\ncigarettes should be included within the scope of the definition of pharmaceutical and therefore managed as\nother hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceuticals rule.\nAdditional information on this rule is available at httpl/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-management-\nstandards-hazy rdous-waste-pharmaceuticals.\nBeyond the pharmaceuticals proposed rule, EPA has issued guidance to provide regulatory clarity regarding the\nfollowing issues:\n5\n\n\u2022 In letters dated May 8, 2015, EPA issued separate guidance clarifying that: (1) e-cigarettes are P075 waste\ndue to the attached cartridges of nicotine (RCRA Online 14850) and (2) nicotine patches, gums, lozenges and\ne-cigarettes are not solid or hazardous waste when sent for nicotine reclamation (RCRA Online 14851).\n\u2022 In a letter dated October 2, 2015, EPA also issued guidance clarifying that pharmaceutical controlled\nsubstances from households can be accepted at Drug Enforcement Agency -authorized collection receptacles,\nincluding those established at retail stores with pharmacies (RCRA Online 14853).\nV. Upcoming EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nEPA is currently focusing the Agency's near-term efforts on finalizing the Pharmaceuticals and Generator\nImprovements rules. However, we will be undertaking a number of upcoming activities that will also address the\nRCRA concerns of the retail sector and other stakeholders.\nPrimarily, these activities include issuing a guide to recycling aerosol cans, proposing to add aerosol cans to the\nfederal universal waste rules, and developing a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail\nsector as a whole.\nTo date, EPA has gathered useful information regarding management of consumer goods in the retail sector and\nthe associated issues encountered during this process. The Agency's strategy calls for continued engagement\nwith the retail sector and other stakeholders, such as industry representatives and state/tribaUlocal governments, to\nsupport our efforts in moving forward to address the reverse distribution process and universal waste\nmanagement. As necessary, in order to inform future EPA decisions, this outreach/coordination process is\nexpected to involve attending meetings/conferences, conducting site visits and participating in work groups.\nUpcoming activities are discussed in more detail below.\nA. Guide to Recycling Aerosol Cans\nEPA is developing a guide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subtitle C recycling exclusions,\nincluding recyling aerosol cans for scrap metal recovery. EPA anticipates that this guide will assist generators of\naerosol cans and recyclers to increase their recycling of this ubiquitous waste stream.\nB. Role ofUniversal Waste Regulations\nEPA has been exploring the potential for adding certain retail items, such as aerosol cans, pesticides, and/or\nelectronics, to the federal universal waste regulations by conducting the following activities:\n\u2022 Obtain additional information regarding state programs currently in place to manage aerosol cans (e.g.,\nCalifornia and Colorado) and electronics (e.g., Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana,\nMichigan, Nebraska and New Jersey) as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Identify and consult with states that are considering including aerosol cans, electronics or other types of items\nas categories of universal waste.\n\u2022 Determine the extent to which states regulate other retail items, including pesticides beyond those recalled, as\nin suspended or cancelled, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Evaluate information received from states, including any advantages/disadvantages and challenges associated\nwith management of retail items as universal wastes.\n9 Additional information regarding EPA's key observations and particular examples of stakeholder outreach efforts to date is provided in\nthe Appendixto this strategy.\nG~\n\nIn addition to aforementioned, EPA considers a number of factors, as set forth in federal RCRA regulations, when\ndetermining whether a hazardous waste or category of hazardous waste should be included as universal wastes.'o\nTaking into account feedback from NODA commenters and other information obtained to date, EPA believes that\naerosol cans are 1~7cely to be good candidates for management under federal universal waste regulations.\nTherefore, the Agency is moving forward with plans to develop a proposed rule to address aerosol cans as\nuniversal waste.\nC. Policy on Reverse Distribution and RCRA\nEPA recognizes that, although there are areas within the program that work well, RCRA regulations may not\nalways be the best frt for the retail sector. This has come to light in terms of the reverse distribution process used\nin the retail sector, particular as relates to when discard occurs or is intended to occur and the timing of waste\ndeterminations.\nTherefore, EPA intends to develop a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail sector as a\nwhole. In doing so, EPA is working from the Agency's understanding regarding the \"flow\" of consumer goods\namong different entities, as well as the roles/relationships of retailers, suppliers/vendors, reverse logistics centers\nand others with respect to unused intact consumer goods that have become unsalable at retail stores for a variety\nof reasons and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\" Unsalable retail items include excess\ninventory, such as expired or outdated items, seasonal items, overstock, recalled (volunta.ry or involuntary)\nproducts and returned items.\nIn developing this policy, EPA will take into account key observations made to date (see appendix), with a\nparticular focus on the nature/extent and significance of challenges encountered when managing consumer goods\nin the retail sector, by considering the following issues:\n\u2022 Scope of the retail \"universe,\" including the number of individually- or family-owned stores\n\u2022 Positions of regulators such as EPA regions, states/tribes and, as necessary, local governments on the location\nof the point of generation\n\u2022 Extent to which inspections by regulators continue to identify compliance issues in the retail sector, including\nfailure to make hazardous waste determinations\n\u2022 Extent to which the reverse distribution process results in appropriate management of unsalable consumer\ngoods originating from retail stores, such that the percentage of retail items disposed as solid or hazardous\nwaste is reduced to the maximum eactent possible\nThis policy is not intended to address wastes from routine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials,\nas well as damaged/leaking products no longer considered commodities and \"unknowns\" (item contents cannot be\nidentified).\nContact: Questions regarding this strategy should be directed to Drew Launch at lausch.robert@epa.gov or 703-\n603-0721 or Kristin Fitzgerald at fitzgerald.kristin@epa.gov or 703-308-8286.\n10 These factors are discussed at 40 CFR 273.81.\n~ ~ A diagam showing the flow of retail items and relationships among various organizations that manage consumer goods and wastes is\navailable at http://www.epagov/hwgenerators/strategy-addressing-retail-sector-under-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act.\n7\n\nAPPENDIX\nKey Observations to Date\nAs part of developing this strategy, the Agency has been conducting outreach efforts (meetings, conferences, site\nvisits, etc.) with key stakeholders and, based on these efforts, the following is noted in no particular order of\nimportance:\n\u2022 When and where hazardous waste determinations are made (i.e., at the store versus at a reverse logistics\ncenter) varies from retailer to retailer and from product to product \u2014and may also vary with time.\n\u2022 Positions of regulators on the location of the point of generation (when a product becomes a waste) vary and\ninspections of retail stores have identified compliance issues \u2014and inspections are anticipated to occur in the\nfuture.\n\u2022 Certain retail chains use safety data sheet-based scanning systems keyed to universal product codes (UPCs) or\nstock keeping units (SKUs) to assist in making waste determinations at the store; however, smaller retailers\nand individually- or family-owned stores may lack this capability and/or may not be fully aware of RCRA\nobligations.\n\u2022 Information regarding the chemical content of certain manufacturers' products is sometimes made publicly\navailable or, if it is considered confidential business information, may be selectively shared with others in\norder to inform appropriate end-of-life management.\n\u2022 There e~sts software that relies upon proprietary manufacturers' product information to determine\nappropriate disposition of unsalable retail items, although how widely this software is utilized across the retail\nsector is not fully known.\n\u2022 Retailers are using third parties to ensure proper management of products determined to be hazardous waste at\nstore locations, although the extent to which this occurs across the retail sector is uncertain.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers also use an SDS-based UPC/SKU scanning system, although the extent to which\nreverse logistics centers as a whole are taking this approach is uncertain.\n\u2022 Waste determinations typically occur at the reverse logistics centers for some retail goods when it's clear that\nthese items have a high possibility of being donated, liquidated or otherwise recycled.\n\u2022 Certain non-prescription drugs (e.g., hand sanitizers, multi-symptom cold relievers and sore throat medicines)\nand supplements such as vitamins are sent to reverse logistics centers where they are disposed as hazardous\nwaste if, for example, the expiration date has passed.\n\u2022 Protocols or corporate directives are in place that specify how retail stores, reverse logistics centers and\nsuppliers/vendors handle excess inventory, make hazardous waste determinations and decide the ultimate\ndisposition of products, ahhough this seems less l~cely in the case of individually- or family-owned stores.\n\u2022 Contracts or other written agreements exist between a retailer and supplier/vendor that specify how the\nprocess for returning unsalable items and awarding of credit works, as well as the extent to which particular\nproducts are required to be managed a certain way, such as prohibiting donation/Gquidation and requiring\ndisposal as hazardous waste due to \"branding issues\" or other concerns.lz\n1z Since EPA is aware that a large percentage of unsalable retail items are \"returned to the supplier/vendor,\" the ultimate disposition of\nthese items is of interest to the Agency.\n8\n\n\u2022 Credit is provided to retailers for unsalable consumer goods, which have an inherent value in that they remain\npotentially marketable as commodities that could be donated or liquidated, which serves as incentive for\nproper management until such time credit is received. 13\n\u2022 Retailers may also be assuming increased responsibility for management and ultimate disposition of unsalable\nretail items as part of the \"Adjustable Rate Policy\" process (supplier/vendor or agent not involved). `a\n\u2022 Given past experiences or other information, such as agreements between suppliers/vendors and\nretailers, retailers may know beforehand that certain consumer goods will ultimately be disposed as hazardous\nwaste, including products that are returned to ensure receipt of manufacturer/supplier credit.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers play a key role in the management of consumer goods, performing functions such as\ndata collection, financial reconciliation such as credit verification, recall management, material tracking and\nmaterial disposition (i.e., reuse, recycling or disposal).\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers may also offer benefits such as increasing the likelihood that consumer goods may\nbe donated or liquidated, due to economies of scale, and ensuring that hazardous waste determinations are\nproperly performed.\n\u2022 The role played by suppliers/vendors in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition, is critical and\nrepresents an area requiring further study.\n\u2022 Suppliers/vendors play a critical role in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition.\n\u2022 Retail items may be repaired/refurbished for ultimate use by consumers but how often and by whom is\nuncertain.\nCertain unsalable retail items may be returned to the manufacturer for use in preparing products (i.e., blended\ninto existing formulations), although the extent to which this occurs is unknown.\n\u2022 Feedback from state programs thus far indicates that management of items such as aerosol cans and\nelectronics as universal wastes works well.\n\u2022 Recycling of aerosol can propellant for use as fuel and the actual container as scrap metal, appear more\ncommon than recycling of can contents (product).\n13 It does not necessarily follow that these items will ultimately be donated or liquidated since they may become a waste in cases where a\nsupplier/vendor requires disposal or where a reverse logistics center determines that disposal is the only remaining management option.\nla Additional information on the Adjustable Rate Policy and other reimbursement policies for unsalable items can be found in the\npublication entitled, 2008 Joint Industry Unsaleables Management Study: The Real Causes and Actionable Solutions. This publication\nis available at http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/CJnsaleablesFINAL091108.pdf.\n0\n\nStakeholder Outreach Efforts\nSince the close of the NODA comment period, EPA has been reaching out to various stakeholders and engaging\nin discussions in order to learn more about challenges associated with RCRA and the retail sector. Some examples\ninclude:\n\u2022 EPA participated in the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RICA) conference during September 29-October\n2, 2014 in Minneapolis, MN, which accorded an opportunity to network with various industry representatives\nregarding the Retail NODA and the Agency's retail initiative.\n\u2022 EPA provided an update regarding the Retail NODA at the annual meeting of the Association of State and\nTerritorial Solid Waste Management Officials on October 30, 2014 in Reston, VA.\n\u2022 On November 20, 2014, EPA met with the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) to learn more about\nWFCA's industry/membership and discuss the Retail NODA and better understand the relevance of Agency's\nretail initiative and retail strategy development on products manufactured by WFCA members.\n\u2022 On January 7, 2015, EPA provided regulatory updates to regions and states including a discussion regarding\nthe status of the Pharmaceuticals Rule, Generator Improvement Rule and Defirrition of Solid Waste Rule, as\nwell as efforts associated with the retail initiative and retail strategy development.\n\u2022 On January 14, 2015, EPA participated in a regulatory roundtable as part of the Council on Safe\nTransportation of Hazardous Articles Quarterly Membership meeting in Arlington, VA.

EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \n \n1. Introduction  \n \nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association (\u201cRILA\u201d) , the Food Marketing Institute (\u201cFMI\u201d), and \nthe National Association of Chain Drug Stores (\u201cNACDS\u201d), and their members (collectively, the \n\u201cRetail Associations\u201d) are pleased to submit these comments in response to  the proposal of the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or the \u201cAgency\u201d) to classify and regulate \nhazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery \nAct (\u201cRCRA\u201d).  See 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654  (March 16 , 201 8).     \n \nRetailers sell a wide variety of aerosol products in our stores every day that are generally deemed \nsafe for consumption or use by ordinary consumers, and meet all applicable safety regulations. \nExamples include deodorants, hair styling products, shaving creams, cheese, sp ot removers, etc. \nIf a customer discards these products at home, he or she throws it out in the normal municipal \nwaste disposal or recycling stream.  However, when the same consumer product goes unsold by \na store or is returned to a store by a customer, it  may be classified as a \u201chazardous waste,\u201d \npotentially subjecting the store to the same burdensome hazardous waste generator regulations as \na steel mill or chemical plant.  \n \nBecause of the regulatory complexity and uncertainty, retailers often have little c hoice but to \nhandle all their unsold, returned, or used aerosols as fully regulated hazardous wastes, despite the \nfact that the products pose little or no risk to human health and the environment.  As a result \naerosol cans now account for up to 50 percent or more of the materials from the retail sector that \nare deemed to be hazardous wastes.  This imposes tremendous costs on the industry and makes \nrecycling difficult or impractical.  In order to address these issues, a number of states have \nstreamlined the requirements for aerosol wastes by classifying them as universal wastes.  \n \nThe Retail Associations greatly appreciate this opportunity to submit comments on the proposed \naddition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the federal universal waste regulations.  T his is also \nan important opportunity to further build our relationship and continue to work with the Agency \non ways to protect our customers and the environment, while streamlining the burdensome \nregulatory compliance process for our businesses \u2013 two goals  that are not mutually exclusive.  \n\n \n- 2 - \n \n \nWe would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input to EPA, and to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made in these comments.  \n \nSection 2 below provides a general summary of our co mments.  Section 3 provides background \non the Retail Associations and their interest in this rulemaking.  Section 4 expresses the \nAssociations\u2019 strong support for the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes \nas universal wastes, and pr ovides further reasons for such action.  Section 5 explains certain \nchanges to the scope of the proposed rule that we think are essential to make the rule workable \nand to maximize its benefits.  Section 6 urges EPA to clarify that as soon as the final rule  is \nissued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all states without a \nhazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  Section 7 explains why we believe \nthe Agency\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule dram atically underestimates the \ncost savings that could be achieved under  the proposal (with the changes we are suggesting).   \nSection 8 highlights the need for the Agency to issue guidance on certain fundamental issues \nrelated to aerosols, in addition to issui ng the universal waste rule , and Section 9 provides a brief \nconclusion.   Finally, we once again commend the Agency for this process and reiterate the \ncommitment of the Retail Associations to continuing to work with EPA to develop common \nsense regulations t hat protect our customers and the environment while not overburdening \nbusinesses with red tape and compliance costs.  \n \n2. Summary of Comments  \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the classification and regulation of hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes as universal wastes.  As discussed in Section 3 below, the Retail Associations \nrepresent a broad cross section of the retail industry \u2013 the economic sector that EPA recogniz es \nas having the largest percentage of entities affected by this rulemaking \u2013 and thus ha ve a strong \ninterest in the Agency\u2019s universal waste proposal.  We have been urging EPA to take this type of \naction for several years, and are pleased that the Agency has initiated the current rulemaking.  As \ndiscussed more fully in Section 4 below, we believe aerosol cans are particularly well suited for \naddition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all of the criteria specified in the \nregulations for classi fication as universal wastes.  For example, they are generated ubiquitously, \npose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated and non -regulated streams, and \nwould be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA hazardous waste r egulations \nwere not applied during generation, storage, transport, and collection.  In addition, they have \nbeen successfully managed as universal wastes in several states for many years.  \n \nWe are concerned, however, that the scope of the proposal has been unnecessarily and \ninappropriately narrowed in certain ways that would make the universal waste rule unworkable, \nespecially in the retail sector  (which EPA estimates represent s approximate two -thirds of the \naffected generator universe) .  In particular, as d iscussed in Section 5 below, the proposed rule \nwould require generators to make fine technical judgments about each individual aerosol can  in \norder to determine whether it can be managed as a universal waste .  Some of these technical \njudgments include : \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n \no Whether t he can  dispenses chemical products in the form of a foam or spray  (eligible for \nmanagement as a universal waste) or in the form of a gel or paste  (potentially not \neligible);  \n \no Whether the can expels only gas (potentially not eligible) or also exp els a solid or liquid \n(eligible);  \n \no Whether any dried spray, splatters, or drips o n the outside a re evidence of leakage \n(potentially not eligible) or simply usage (eligible); and  \n \no Whether the can is both \u201cempty\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d (in which case it might n ot be eligible), \neven though EPA has repeatedly said that it cannot clearly define when an aerosol can is \nempty or reactive.  \n \nWe question whether any generator could confidently make these types of judgments .  In any \nevent, in the retail sector, drawing a ll these distinctions would be hopelessly impractical, given \nthe extremely wide range of aerosol products being handled, the significant numbers of waste \naerosol cans  being generated , the limited experience o f most retail employees with these types of \nissues, and the high turnover of retail personnel.  Moreover, EPA has long maintained that one of \nthe key advantages of the universal waste rule is that it obviates the need for distinguishing \nbetween look-alike products.  For these reasons and others discusse d in Section 5, we urge the \nAgency  to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated products and gas -only \nproducts, by removing or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leaking or \ndamage, and by clarifying the status of empt y aerosol cans.   \n \nEPA  should also clarify that as soon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may \nimmediately be transported in all states without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste \ntransporter  \u2013 regardless of if/when the s tates adopt the universal waste rule .  As discussed in \nSection 6, even though states generally have the authority to impose hazardous waste rules that \nare more stringent than the federal regulations, they are preempted from imposing more stringent \nrules with respect to transport of hazardous wastes, as a result of the explicit preemption \nprovisions of the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act .  Clarifying this point would go \na long way toward accelerating and maximizing the benefits of the universal waste rule, \nespecially for companies that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes in multiple states ( e.g., \nnationwide or regional retailers)  and/or need or want to transport such wastes across state lines to \nan environmentally sound recycling or disposal facility.   EPA should also, as it has with other \nuniversal waste rules, encourage states to adopt the final rule and issue guidance specifying that \nthe Agency will not take enforcement actions involvi ng aerosol can universal wastes that are \nmanaged in compliance with the universal waste rule, regardless of whether the state has adopted \nthe rule or received authorization for the rule.     \n       \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings th at would result from the rule are likely \nfar greater than EPA estimated in its R egulatory Impact Analysis \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 \nmillion per year or more.  As discussed in Section 7 below, the Agency \u2019s primary methodology \nfor estimating the cost savings  was fundamentally flawed, in large part because it assumed that \n \n- 4 - \n \n \nretail stores (the largest category of affected generators) are similar to manufacturing facilities in \nthat only a very small percentage are likely to have their \u201cgenerator status \u201d (i.e., their status as \nLarge, Small, or Very Small Quantity Generator s) change as a result of the universal waste rule.  \nIn fact, however, the rule is likely to have a substantial effect on the generator status of retail \nfacilities ( e.g., stores, distribution center s, and return centers), since they commonly generate \nrelatively low volumes of hazardous wastes, and hazardous aerosol can wastes represent a \nsubstantial percentage  of such wastes .  Indeed, this is why the Retail Associations have been \nadvocating so strong ly over the last several years for a universal waste rule for aerosols.          \n \nFinally, t o further improv e the regulatory framework for aerosol cans,  we also urge the Agency \nto move forward on its separate commitment to issue guidance on when aerosol ca ns are subject \nto hazardous waste regulation in the first instance.  In particular, as discussed in Section 8 below, \nwe ask EPA to clarify (a) that aerosol cans destined for recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that \naerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of reactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty \nonce they are no longer capable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way \nas required for the intended application , and (d) that  generators may use statistical information to \ndetermine the quantity of aerosol cans that need to be counted in determining their hazardous \nwaste generator status .  EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final \nuniversal waste ru le, if that can be done without delaying the universal waste rule.   However, the \nfirst priority should be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, \nwhich can be followed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.  In any event, the Retail \nAssociations would welcome the opportunity to work with the Agency to ensure that the \nguidance encourages environmental sound management of used aerosols without imposing \nundue burdens on the regulated community.    \n \n3.  The Retail Associa tions and Their  Interest in This Rulemaking  \n  \nThe Retail Associations represent a broad cross section of the retail sector in the United States, \nincluding large and small companies, from chains with more than a thousand stores nationwide \nto regional compan ies with a handful of stores.   The vast majority of the members of each of the \nAssociations market aerosol products, have the potential to generate hazardous aerosol can \nwastes (as discussed further below), and therefore have a strong interest in the curre nt \nrulemaking.  Each of the individual Associations is described briefly below:  \n \no RILA is an organization of the world\u2019s most successful and innovative retailer and \nsupplier companies \u2013 the leaders of the retail industry.  RILA members represent more \nthan $1.5 trillion in annual sales and operate more than 100,000 stores, manufacturing \nfacilities, and distribution centers nationwide.  Our member retailers and suppliers have \nfacilities in all 50 states and the District of Col umbia, as well as internationally, and \nemploy millions of workers domestically and worldwide.  \n \no FMI proudly advocates on behalf of the food retail industry, which employs nearly 5 \nmillion workers and represents a combined annual sales volume of almost  $800 \nbillion.   FMI member companies operate nearly 33,000 retail food stores and 12,000 \npharmacies.   FMI membership includes the entire spectrum of food retail venues : single \n \n- 5 - \n \n \nowner grocery stores, large multi -store supermarket chains, pharmacies, online and \nmixed retail stores.   Through programs in public affairs, food safety, research, education, \nhealth and wellness and industry relations, FMI offers resources and provides val uable \nbenefits to almost 1,000 food retail and wholesale member companies and serves 85 \ninternational retail member companies.   In addition, FMI has almost 500 associate \nmember companies that provide products and services to the food retail industry.     \n \no NACDS represents traditional drug stores, supermarkets , and mass merchants with \npharmacies.  Chains operate 40,000 pharmacies, and NACDS\u2019 nearly 100 chain member \ncompanies include regional chains, with a minimum of four stores, and national \ncompanies.  Chains employ nearly 3 million individuals, including 152,000 pharmacists.  \nThey fill over 3 billion prescriptions yearly, and help patients use medicines correctly and \nsafely, while offering innovative services that improve patient health and healthcare \naffordability.  NACDS members also include more than 900 supplier partners and over \n70 international members representing 20 countries.  \n \nThe Retail Associations and their members have a clear and strong interest in this rulemaking.  \nIndeed, EPA, in the pre amble to the proposal , stated that \u201c[the] economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the \nlargest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade industry \u2026 representing \n65% of the affected Large Quantity Generator universe.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Retailers, \nincluding members  of the Associations , market an extremely wide range of aerosol products, \nincluding but not limited to the following:  \n \n\uf0a7 Adhesives  \n\uf0a7 Air fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Air horn s \n\uf0a7 Antifungal treatments  \n\uf0a7 Antistatic agents  \n\uf0a7 Artificial snow  \n\uf0a7 Bathroom cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Carpet cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Cooking oils  \n\uf0a7 Cheese  \n\uf0a7 Deodorants  \n\uf0a7 Disinfectants  \n\uf0a7 Engine degreasers  \n\uf0a7 Fabric fresheners  \n\uf0a7 Fabric protectors  \n\uf0a7 First aid products  \n\uf0a7 Floor cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Foam insulation  \uf0a7 Furniture polishes  \n\uf0a7 Hair styling products  \n\uf0a7 Lubricants  \n\uf0a7 Novelties  \n\uf0a7 Oven cleaners  \n\uf0a7 Paints  \n\uf0a7 Perfumes  \n\uf0a7 Pesticides  \n\uf0a7 Shaving creams  \n\uf0a7 Starter fluids  \n\uf0a7 Sealants  \n\uf0a7 Spot removers  \n\uf0a7 Starch  \n\uf0a7 Sunscreens  \n\uf0a7 Tanning products  \n\uf0a7 Varnishes  \n\uf0a7 Waterproofing treatments  \n\uf0a7 Whipped dessert toppings  \n \nOf course, the vast majority of aerosols handled by retailers are not wastes in their hands, but \nrather are sold to customers and ultimately disposed or recycled (after use) by the customers.  \nNevertheless, significan t amounts are either returned by customers or are unsold due to various \n \n- 6 - \n \n \nreasons ( e.g., damage, defect, recall, obsolescence, expiration, seasonal product changes, or \nremoval from shelves due to failure to \u201csell through\u201d at an acceptable rate).  Most of the se \nunsold/returned items are not wastes, because they are suitable for re -shelving, liquidation sale \nthrough a secondary market, donation to non -profit organizations, or shipment to a manufacturer \nor its agent for credit.  In some instances, however, the u nsold/returned aerosol products do \nbecome wastes, and depending upon their composition, may be classified as hazardous wastes.  \nMembers of the Retail Associations have reported that aerosols represent up to 50% (by weight) \nor even more of all the potential ly hazardous unsold/returned products that they handle.   \nRetailers may also generate smaller amounts of aerosol can wastes in other ways, such as \nthrough cleaning/maintenance of buildings, equipment, and vehicles, constructing product \ndisplays, preparing f oods and beverages, providing various services to customers, and \nconducting routine office/administrative functions.   In light of all these potential mechanisms for \ngenerating hazardous aerosol can wastes, the Retail Associations , their members, and the re tail \nsector more broadly, have a strong interest in the current rulemaking.                   \n \n4. The Retail Associations  Strongly Support the Classification and Regulation of \nHazardous Aerosol Can Wastes as Universal Wastes   \n \nThe Retail Associations strongly support the addition of hazardous aerosol can wastes to the \nRCRA universal waste rule.  Indeed, the Associations have been urging the Agency take this step \nfor several years, such as in comments submitted together with another retail sector trade \nassociation ( i.e., the National Retail Federation) on EPA\u2019s 2014 Notice of Data Availability \n(\u201cNODA\u201d) on the application of RCRA to retailers.  See Comments of the Retail Associations in \nResponse to EPA\u2019s NODA on the Application of RCRA to the Retail Indus try (May 30, 2014)  \n(EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-RCRA -2012 -0426 -0038)  (\u201cRetail Associations NODA Comments\u201d) \n(Attachment 1 to the current comments) at 26 -31.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , also \nencouraged EPA to adopt a universal waste rule for aerosol c an wastes as part of t he Agency\u2019s \nregulatory reform efforts under Executive Order 13777.  See Comments of the Retail Industry \nLeaders Association on EPA\u2019s Request for Public Comment on \u201c Evaluation of Existing \nRegulations\u201d (May 15, 2017)  (EPA Docket ID# EPA -HQ-2017 -0190 -32612)  (\u201cRILA Regulatory \nReform Comments\u201d)  (Attachment 2) at 8-13.     \n \nEPA has presented a compelling case for classification of hazardous aerosol can wastes as \nuniversal wastes in the preamble to the current proposal.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 1 1,658 -59.  \nHowever, w e provide below some additional support demonstrating that aerosol cans meet each \nof the criteria set forth in the RCRA regulations for additions to the list of universal wastes.1  In \nshort, aerosol cans are perfectly suited for manage ment under the u niversal waste  program since \nthey are generated ubiquitously, pose relatively low risks, are difficult to segregate into regulated \nand non -regulated streams, and would be handled in a more protective manner if the full RCRA \nhazardous waste regulations were not applied during generation, collection, and transport.  \nMoreover, a number of states (including environmental leaders such as California and Colorado ) \n                                                 \n1  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81.   It is worth noting that EPA has stressed that \u201cit does not believe that each and \nevery factor must be met in order for a waste to be appropriate for the universal waste system, and for regulation of \nthe waste under part 273 to improve waste management an d implementation.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,513  \n(May 11, 1995)  (stating further that \u201cthe Agency will make decisions based on the weight of the evidence\u201d).   \n \n- 7 - \n \n \nhave long classified and regulated aerosol cans as universal wastes, and their programs for doing \nso appear to have been highly successful.   \n \no CRITERION #1:   The waste or category of waste, as generated by a wide variety of \ngenerators, is listed in subpa rt D of part 261 of this chapter, or (if not listed) a \nproportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics of hazardous waste \nidentified in subpart C of part 261 of this chapter.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(a)]   \n \n As EPA notes in the preamble to t he proposal, aerosol cans may exhibit the RCRA \ncharacteristic of ignitability if they contain flammable propellants such as propane or \nbutane.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,656.  In addition, discarded aerosol cans may be \nhazardous if they contain commercial che mical products that either exhibit a hazardous \ncharacteristic or are listed as hazardous wastes.  Id.   While in many instances it may be \ndifficult for a generator to determine if the aerosol can wastes it generates are hazardous \nor not, there can be no do ubt that many  waste aerosol cans  are hazardous.      \n \n Of course, many \u2013 perhaps even most \u2013 aerosol cans are not hazardous .  Nevertheless, \nhazardous aerosol  can waste s can and should still be designated as universal wastes.  \nIndeed, EPA has long recognized  that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule \nis that it \u201celiminates [the need for] identifying, documenting, and keeping separate \nregulated waste and unregulated waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,513.  The Agency noted \nthat it \u201cwishes to encoura ge persons to manage both regulated waste and unregulated \nwaste in the same collection systems \u2026 [a]s long as all commingled waste is managed in \na system that meets the requirements of the universal waste regulations.\u201d  Id.  EPA \nindicated that this approac h was particularly attractive in situations where \u201can across the \nboard hazardous waste determination [could not be made] for entire categories of waste\u201d \nand/or where a waste \u201ceither becomes hazardous or is no longer hazardous due to \nchanges in manufacturin g practices [or product composition].\u201d  Id.  Given the difficulty \nin determining which waste aerosols are hazardous and which are not, they seem to be an \nideal candidate for designation as universal wastes.  \n \no CRITERION #2:   The waste or category of waste  is not exclusive to a specific industry \nor group of industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of \nestablishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial businesses, \noffice complexes, conditionally exempt small quantity  generators, small businesses, \ngovernment organizations, as well as large industrial facilities).  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.81(b)]  \n \n As discussed above, the retail industry handle s a significant amount of unsold/returned \naerosol cans.  However, a much larger quant ity of waste aerosol cans are generated by the \npersons and entities that purchase and use aerosol products.  Households are by far \n \n- 8 - \n \n \ncollectively the largest generators of such wastes.2  However, a wide variety of \nbusinesses generate  aerosol wastes , as well,  by using the products.    \n \n In the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the proposed rule, EPA identifies 18 industries \nwith large and small quantity generators that generate hazardous aerosol can wastes.  See \n83 Fed. Reg. at 11,638.  However, we believe that the range of generators of such wastes \nis much broader.   For example, vehicle fleet owners and service centers commonly use \naerosol lubricants, paints, sealants, and the like, and the same is true for virtually anyone \nwho owns or services industrial equipment.  Office buildings and cleaning services use a \nvariety of aerosol cleaning products for both hard surfaces ( e.g., wood polish, bathroom \ncleaners, etc.) and fabric surfaces ( e.g., carpet cleaners and upholstery fresheners).  \nHealthcare facilities use aerosol disinfectants.  Exterminators and businesses with pest \ncontrol problems use aerosol pesticides.  Hair salons use aerosol hair sprays, styling gels, \nand the like.  Laundries and dry cleaners use aerosol spot removers and fabric protectors.  \nRestaurants use aerosol cooking sprays, and other food products.  The list of businesses, \nlarge and small, that use products dispensed with aerosol cans and generate the cans as \nwastes is almost endless.  Moreover, federal, state, and local government agencies  are \nalso major users and generators of aerosols, inasmuch as they operate large office \nbuildings, infrastructure facilities, healthcare centers, schools, parks, and facilities where \nlarge numbers of individuals are housed ( e.g., military installations and  prisons).  \nAlthough most of these commercial /government users of products in aerosol cans are not \nrequired to handle the used cans as hazardous wastes ( e.g., because they qualify as Very \nSmall Quantity Generators (\u201c VSQGs \u201d)), they collectively constitute a  major portion of \nthe used aerosol can stream.  \n \n Clearly, waste  aerosol cans are generated ubiquitously in an extremely wide range of \nsettings, both industrial and not.  This fact makes them ideal candidates for the universal \nwaste rule.  EPA has long str essed that \u201c[o]ne of the problems the universal waste rule is \ndesigned to address is that a relatively large portion of some waste types are exempt from \nthe hazardous waste regulations ( i.e., are generated by households and CESQGs  [i.e., \nConditionally Exem pt Small Quantity Generators] ) and are indistinguishable from the \nregulated portion of the waste.  This \u2018look alike\u2019 problem makes implementation of the \n[standard RCRA] program for these wastes extremely difficult.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at \n25,514.  Aerosol ca ns appear to be precisely the type of material that EPA had in mind.  \nA large proportion of aerosol cans are generated as wastes by exempt household s and \nVSQGs, but regulated entities generate a substantial amount of aerosol wastes, as well, \nand such waste s are typically indistinguishable from the aerosols generated by exempt \npersons.             \n \n \n                                                 \n2  See, e.g. , European Aerosol Federation, \u201cAnnual Report 2017\u201d (Attachment 3) at 17 (indicati ng that 55.5% \nof aerosol products produced in Europe are personal care products, and an additional 20.7% are household \nproducts).   \n \n- 9 - \n \n \no CRITERION #3:   The waste or category of waste is generated by a large number of \ngenerators (e.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated in re latively \nsmall quantities by each generator.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c)]  \n \n Virtually all households in the U.S. can be expected to generate at least some waste \naerosol cans.  That alone accounts for approximately 100 million generators, making the \nwastes amon g the most  common potentially hazardous wastes generated in the country.  \nAlthough these generators would be excluded from regulation under the household waste \nexclusion, the numbers of business, government, and other institutional generators that \nare pote ntially regulated (unless they qualify as VSQGs) is similarly very large.  The \nRetail Associations estimate that the number of retail establishments in the United States \nhandling unsold/returned aerosols is likely well over 100,000 (based on Census data on  \nthe number of retailers i n key sectors that can be expected to market (and thus handle \nunsold/returned) aerosol products ).3  We have not made an effort to quantify the number \nof generating establishments in other industries, but given the wide range of su ch \nindustries (as noted above), it seems almost certain that the numbers of such generators \nwould be in the millions.   \n \n The amounts generated by each generator likely vary substantially.  Members of the \nRetail Associations report that individual stores often handle up to 1000 lbs/year of \nunsold/returned aerosol cans.  Each household user of aerosols presumably generates a \nfairly limited number of waste aerosol cans each month or year.  Business users of \naerosol products may generate somewhat larger amount s, depending upon their size and \nthe nature of their operations.  However, it might reasonably be expected that if a facility \nrequires a very large amount of a particular chemical product, it might be more likely to \nuse a different means of application.  F or example, a facility that uses large quantities of \nspray paint would likely obtain a bulk liquid paint that could be aerosolized using \ncompressed gas, rather than using individual aerosol cans.  Accordingly, it appears that \nwaste aerosol cans are generat ed by large numbers of generators, most commonly in \nrelatively small quantities.          \n \no CRITERION #4:   Systems to be used for collecting the waste or category of waste \n(including packaging, marking, and labeling practices) would ensure close stewardship \nof the waste.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(d)]  \n \n EPA has stated that \u201cthe goal of this factor is to facilitate addition of wastes to the \nuniversal waste system that are most likely to be collected, and to be collected in a \nmanner that ensures good mana gement of the waste.\u201d  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,514.  The \nRetail Associations believe that aerosol cans are precisely the type of materials that EPA \nhad in mind.  As an initial matter, aerosol cans constitute a large stream that is readily \n                                                 \n3  See U.S. Census Bureau, \u201cStatistical Abstract of the United States: 2012,\u201d Table 1048 (data as of 2008) \n(Attachment 4) (indicating that there are 114,100 gasoline stations, 63,400 supermarkets and grocery stores, 25,700 \nconvenience stores, 56,100 automotive parts/accessories/tire stores, 42,000 pharmacies and drug stores, 23,000 \nhome centers and hardware stores, 22,100 sport ing goods stores, 19,800 lawn and garden stores, 14,000 \ncosmetics/beauty supplies/perfume stores, and 4,400 warehouse clubs and superstores).   \n \n- 10 - \n \n \nidentifiable and e asy to segregate for special management.  Indeed, many of the key \nelements needed for proper stewardship of this waste stream are already in place.  \nAccording to a study organized by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition  (\u201cSPC\u201d) , \napproximately 70% of America ns have access to curbside or drop -off recycling facilities \nthat accept aluminum or steel aerosol cans.  See SPC, \u201c2015 -16 Centralized Study on \nAvailability of Recycling for Aerosol Containers\u201d (Attachment 5).  In addition, several \nmajor waste services pro viders have developed and are marketing programs for collecting \nand recycling waste aerosol cans from consumer and/or business generators.   \n \n Notwithstanding these efforts, it appears that vast quantities of aerosol cans are simply \nbeing disposed of by co nsumers in the ordinary trash.  Designating aerosol cans as \nuniversal wastes would significantly facilitate collection and recycling programs, and \nwould encourage use  of such programs .4  The requirements of the universal waste rule \nwould also ensure that t hese activities are performed in a manner that is protective of \nhuman health and the environment.              \n \no CRITERION #5:   The risk posed by the waste or category of waste during \naccumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other hazardou s wastes, and \nspecific management standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appropriate to be added to 40 CFR 273.13, 273.33, and \n273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be \nprotective of human health and the environment during accumulation and transport.   \n[40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e)]  \n \n Waste  or unsold/returned aerosol cans present relatively low risks during accumulation \nand transport.  As an initial matter, these aerosol cans are the same as the aerosol cans \nthat are distributed and used regularly by households and businesses of virtually every \ntype, except that they generally contain significantly less of the propellant and chemical \nproduct than the unused items.  Moreover, as not ed above, over half of all aerosol wastes \nappear to be generated by households, and are frequently disposed of in the ordinary \ntrash.   \n \n It is particularly noteworthy that aerosol cans are not \u201cnaked\u201d chemicals, as might be the \ncase, for example, with bul k pesticides (some of which are already classified as universal \nwastes).  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.3 (classifying certain pesticides as universal wastes).  \nRather, aerosols by their very nature are engineered devices  \u2013 devices  that by law must \nmeet U.S. Departm ent of Transport (\u201c DOT \u201d) requirements for design, filling, testing, \n                                                 \n4  As just one example, in states that regulate household hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes once they are \ncollected, the universal waste rule would enable collected household hazardous aerosol can wastes to be stored at the \ncollection site and transported to an ultimate recycling/disposal facility in accordance with the universal waste \nrequirements, rather than t he full hazardous waste regulations.  See Rhode Island Rules and Regulation for \nHazardous Waste Management, Rule 5.1(b)(1) (\u201cowners and/or operators of facilities that accept household \nhazardous waste \u2026 shall comply with the requirements for Large Quantity  Generators \u2026 and upon receipt the \nhousehold hazardous waste shall be subject to full regulation as hazardous waste\u201d); Minnesota Admin. R. \n7045.0310(3) (\u201cAn operator who establishes or operates all or part of a household hazardous waste management \nprogram must comply with the standards applicable to large quantity generators [with limited exceptions]\u201d).    \n \n- 11 - \n \n \nability to withstand heat and shock, etc.  See generally 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3).  These \nrequirements help minimize risks during both accumulation and transport.  Moreover, \nduring transp ort, the used aerosols, like unused aerosols, are subject to additional DOT \ncontrols.  For example, the aerosols must be packed in strong outer packagings, which \namong other things, must meet general packaging requirements for protectiveness.  See \n49 C.F.R . \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(iv) and 171.8 (defining \u201cstrong outer packaging\u201d).  In addition, \nthe outer packagings must be specially marked.  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(i).  As EPA \nnotes in the preamble to the proposal, see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,658, local fire codes also \nprovide comprehensive protections during storage of aerosols ( e.g., package markings, \nstorage quantity limits, design of storage areas, fire alarm systems, fire protection \nsystems such as sprinklers, etc.).  See, e.g. , National Fire Protection Association \n(\u201cNFPA \u201d) Fire Code (2018), Chapter 61 (Aerosol Products) (Attachment 6).  These DOT \nand fire code requirements should obviate the need for further regulation during \naccumulation and transport.      \n \n To the extent that any additional regulation might be  warranted, the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rules should be sufficient.  They require that the wastes be stored in a \nprotective manner, that containers be labeled and marked to indicate their contents, that \nemployees be trained, that any releases b e addressed appropriately, and that the wastes be \nsent to a properly authorized facility in a timely fashion.  In addition, if a facility \ngenerates or accumulates large quantities, they must notify EPA and track all shipments \nof the waste into and out of t he facility.  These safeguards have proven highly effective \nfor other universal wastes, and the Retail Associations  believe they would likewise be \neffective for aerosol cans (as demonstrated in California , Colorado , and other states, as \ndiscussed below in the context of Criterion #8 ).         \n \no CRITERION #6:   Regulation of the waste or category of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted from non -hazardous waste \nmanagement systems (e.g., the municipal waste s tream, non -hazardous industrial or \ncommercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, \ntreatment, or disposal in compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA.  [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(f)]  \n \n The determination of whether individual aerosol cans a re wastes or non -wastes, and \nhazardous or non -hazardous, can be extremely difficult.   See generally  Retail \nAssociations NODA Comments at 17 -20.  With so many generators in so many different \nindustries, many of which do not generally handle hazardous wastes  and thus are \nparticularly unsuited to making a proper determination, it is almost inevitable that \nmistakes will be made.  Indeed, some generators may not even be aware of the need to \nmake a determination or the possible implications of a hazardous waste d etermination.  \nThis is especially true given that the waste aerosol cans are in many cases identical to, or \nat least similar to, the products that business employees use and discard at their \nhouseholds and therefore are excluded from RCRA regulation.  Thus , it seems likely that \nlarge numbers of generators of potentially hazardous aerosol cans are routinely disposing \nof such products in the ordinary trash.  \n \n \n- 12 - \n \n \n Regulating aerosol cans as universal wastes would significantly reduce this problem.  As \nEPA noted in the final rule designating lamps as universal wastes, \u201cthe streamlined \nrequirements of the universal waste program will give [unsophisticated] generators a \nmore accessible starting point for good environmental management.  If regulatory \nrequirements are simpler, \u2026 more hazardous waste[s] will be handled properly \u2026 \ninstead of going to solid waste landfills or to municipal waste combustors.  Improved \nmanageme nt will \u2026 lead to a reduction in the total amount of hazardous waste emissions \nto the environment.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. 36,466, 36,473 (July 6, 1999).   \n \n Moreover, regulating waste aerosol cans as universal waste s would encourage better \nmanagement of such w astes by more sophisticated generators.  For example, such \ngenerators would have less reason to try drawing fine distinctions between used aerosol \ncans that are wastes versus non -wastes, or hazardous versus non -hazardous.  Many \ngenerators \u2013 perhaps most \u2013 would simply direct all their used aerosol cans through the \nuniversal waste system.  EPA has previously acknowledged that this type of result can be \nan important reason for designating wastes as universal.5  Moreover, a universal waste \ndesignation would fa cilitate consolidation of waste aerosol cans from multiple facilities \nand/or generators, which in turn would provide economies of scale that would likely \nmake recycling options more viable.6                \n \no CRITERION #7:   Regulation of the waste or categ ory of waste under 40 CFR part 273 \nwill improve implementation of and compliance with the hazardous waste regulatory \nprogram.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(g)]  \n \n Designating aerosol cans as universal wastes would not only encourage environmentally \npreferred outcome s, as noted above, but would also improve implementation and \ncompliance.  Not only would generators generally be relieved of the requirement to \nassess whether individual cans are wastes or non -wastes, and hazardous or non -\nhazardous, but the same would be t rue for federal and state inspection and enforcement \npersonnel.  Thus, implementation would certainly be improved.  Moreover, as EPA has \nnoted, \u201c[i]f regulatory requirements are simpler [as a result of a universal waste rule], the \ncompliance rate will impr ove.\u201d  See 64 Fed. Reg. at 36,473; see also  70 Fed. Reg. at \n45,511 (\u201cadding [waste] to the universal waste rule will improve compliance with the \nhazardous waste regulations by making it more achievable\u201d).     \n \n                                                 \n5  See 60 Fed. Reg. at 25,515 (\u201cdiversion of unregulated portions of a waste \u2026 from non -hazardous \nmanagement systems could be a reason to add a waste to the universal waste system.  For example, in some cases it \nmay be likely that facilitating the collection of commingled regulated and unregulated waste would encourage \ndevelopment of collection systems that could divert significant quantities of the waste,  including unregulated waste, \nfrom non -hazardous waste management systems\u201d).   \n \n6  Cf. 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,511 (August 5, 2005) (a universal waste designation \u201cwill allow generators \u2026 \nto send [their wastes] to a central consolidation point. \u2026  Under th e universal waste rule, a handler of universal \nwaste can send the universal waste to another handler, where it can be consolidated into a larger shipment for \ntransport to a [recycling] facility\u201d).  \n \n \n- 13 - \n \n \no CRITERION #8:  Such o ther factors as may be appropriate.   [40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81( h)] \n  \n As EPA notes in the proposal, the fact that aerosol can wastes have successfully been \nmanaged as universal wastes under existing programs ( e.g., in California and Colorado) \n\u201cweighs in favor of concluding that manage ment of aerosol cans under the federal \nuniversal waste regulations is likely to be successful.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,659.  \nHowever, the Agency has understated the extent to which aerosols are already being \nmanaged as universal wastes.   \n \n At the present  time, a total of six states allow aerosol can wastes in general to be handled \nas universal wastes.7  Moreover, additional states allow particular categories of aerosol \ncan wastes ( e.g., aerosol paint wastes  or pharmaceutical aerosol wastes ) to be managed as \nuniversal wastes.8  Indeed, even the federal universal waste rule appears to cover aerosol \npesticide wastes  in some circumstances.  See 40 C.F.R.  \u00a7 273.3 (covering, for example, \nunused pesticide products that are collected and managed as part of a waste  pesticide \ncollection program).  As far as we are aware, all of these programs have been successful \nin facilitating the proper management of the aerosol can wastes that they cover.   \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above and in the preamble for the propos ed rule , aerosol cans are \nideal candidates for inclusion in the universal waste rule.  Such a change would be of substantial \nbenefit to the retail industry, but would also benefit a host of other business, government, and \nother institutional generators of aerosol wastes, as well as federal and state environmental \nagencies.  We therefore urge EPA to finalize the proposed rule (with the changes and \nclarifications discussed in detail below) as soon as p ossible . \n \n5. EPA Should Modify the Scope of the Universal Waste Rule for Hazardous A erosol \nCan Wastes to Ensure the Rule Is Workable and Provides Maximum Benefits  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  are strongly supportive of adding hazardous aerosol can wastes \nto the universal waste rule, we are concerned that EPA \u2019s proposal unnecessarily and \ninappropriately limits the scope of the rule by (a) narrowly defining the term \u201caerosol can,\u201d (b) \nexcluding aerosol cans with \u201cevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage,\u201d and (c) including an \nexclusion for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans that is expressed in a manner that may cause some to believe \n                                                 \n7  See California Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16; 6 Color ado Code Regs. 1007 -3, Section 273.2(d); New \nMexico Admin.

As discussed \nbelow, these limits have no rational basis .  In addition, by requiring generators to make fine \ntechnical judgments about each individual aerosol can that they generate as wastes, these limits \nwould render the universal waste rule unworkable, especially in the retail sector (which EPA \nestimates represents approximately two -thirds of the affected generat or universe).   This is one of \nthe things that the universal waste rule was specifically designed to avoid.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. \nReg. at 25,513 ( stating that one of the key benefits of the universal waste rule is that it \n\u201celiminates [the need for] identifyin g, documenting, and keeping separate regulated waste and \nunregulated waste\u201d ).  Accordingly, we urge EPA to eliminate these limitations in the final rule.    \n \n 5.1 Definition of Aerosol  \n \nUnder the proposed rule, an aerosol can would be defined as \u201can intact container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray \nor foam.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,664  (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 260.10 and \n273.9).  As discussed below, the Retail Associations  are concerned that this definition is \nunnecessarily and inappropriately narrow, and that it would complicate and potentially \nundermine implementation of the universal waste rul e.  Accordingly, we request that EPA \nexpand the definition, for example by aligning it with the corresponding definition under \ninternational dangerous goods regulations.  We also request that EPA delete the reference to \n\u201cintact,\u201d because it is unnecessary and likely to create confusion, especially in light of the \nseparate proposed exclusion for aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage \nthat could cause leakage (discussed further below).    \n \nThe proposed definition would exclude two sig nificant categories of products commonly viewed \nas aerosol products, each of which is discussed separately below:  \n \n(1) Products that use compressed/liquefied gas to expel materials without aerating them or \nproducing a spray or foam  \u2013 Common examples of pro ducts in this category that might \nbe found in a retail store would include cans of shaving gel, \u201cspray\u201d cheese, and novelty \nplastic string streamers.  There is no apparent reason for excluding these types of \nproducts from the universal waste rule.  Indeed,  the DOT Hazardous Materials \nRegulations (\u201cHMR\u201d) classify these products as aerosols and regulate them in the same \nmanner as products that aerate materials and produce sprays or foams.9  Similarly, the \nNFPA defines an aerosol container in a way that is independent of whether the material \nbeing dispensed is aerated or produces a spray o r foam.10  Accordingly, we believe that \nthe universal waste rule should similarly cover these products.  \n \n                                                 \n9  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.8 (defining an aerosol as \u201can article consisting of any non -refillable receptacle \ncontaining a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a \u2026 liquid, \npaste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device allowing the contents to be ejected by the gas\u201d).   \n \n10  See NFPA Code 30B, Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 (defining an aerosol container as a metal can or plastic \ncontainer that uses \u201cliquefied or compressed gas [to] expel[ ] the cont ents \u2026 when [a] valve is actuated\u201d).   \n \n \n- 15 - \n \n \n(2) Products that contain and expel only gas  \u2013 Common use examples of products in this \ncategory that might be found in a retail store would include  compressed gas dusters and \npneumatic horns.  The proposed regulatory definition of aerosol would not necessa rily \nexclude these products, since they are articles in which \u201cgas under pressure is used to \naerate and dispense any material [in this case the gas itself] through a valve in the form of \na spray .\u201d  However, the preamble to the proposal seems to indicate th at EPA intends to \nexclude gas -only products.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (\u201ccompressed gas canisters \u2026 \nwould not be included\u201d).  The only rationale the Agency gives is that these products \nallegedly \u201cpresent a greater risk than aerosol cans.\u201d   Id.  However, as far as we can tell, \nthere is no evidence of such increased risk.  Indeed, international rules for the transport of \ndangerous goods explicitly classify gas -only products as aerosols and regulate them in the \nsame way as aerosols that expel other materials .11  Moreover, under the existing DOT \nregulations, gas -only products are regulated in much the same way as aerosols, and DOT \nis currently considering a petition to align the definition of aerosol under the HMR with \nthe international definition in order to explicitly cover gas -only products.12  Accordingly, \nwe believe that these products pose essentially the same risks as products with gases that \nexpel other materials, and that they should therefore also be covered by the universal \nwaste rule.  \n \nNot only would the exclusion of these products be unnecessary and inappropriate, but it would \nalso substantially complicate and undermine implementation of the rule.  If these products are \nexcluded, generators and other handlers might effectively be required to inspect e ach and every \naerosol can to determine whether it is a non -aerating product or a gas -only product ineligible for \nmanagement as universal waste.  Failure to do so might require the generator/handler to handle \nall of its aerosol wastes as (non -universal) haz ardous wastes, which would render the universal \nwaste rule a nullity.  However, performing the inspection would be extremely challenging and \nmight even be a non -starter.  This is especially true in the retail sector, given the exceptionally \nbroad range of aerosol products carried by many stores, and the generally limited experience and \nhigh turnover of personnel in the sector.        \n \nIn the preamble to the proposal, EPA also states that the proposed definition would have the \nadvantage of \u201ckeep[ing] consist ency with the existing state [universal waste] programs [covering \naerosols].\u201d  However, two state universal waste programs already cover non -aerating products \n                                                 \n11  See, e.g. , United Nations Recommendations on Transport of Dangerous Goods: Model Regulations (\u201cUN \nModel Regulations\u201d), Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9) (\u201cAerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a \nnon-refillable receptacle \u2026 containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved under pressure, with or without a \nliquid, paste or powder , and fitted with a release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid \nparticles in suspension in a  gas, as a foam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state \u201d (emphasis \nadded)).   \n \n12  See 49 C.F.R. 173.306 (rules for limited quantities of compressed gases, including those in aerosol and \nnon-aerosol products); Petition of the Consumer Sp ecialty Products Association, the Council on Safe Transportation \nof Hazardous Articles, Inc., the National Aerosol Association, and the American Coatings Association to DOT \n(September 28, 2017) (Attachment 10) (stressing the safety of \u201cpure gas units used in consumer and industrial \n[applications]\u201d).   \n \n \n- 16 - \n \n \nand/or gas -only products.13  Moreover, as noted above, regulations that apply across the nation \nand/or internationally generally include these products.  Accordingly, the best way to maintain \nconsistency with existing regulatory regimes would be to define aerosol cans in a way that \nincludes non -aerating and gas -only products.    \n   \nIn light of the abov e, we urge EPA to change the proposed definition of aerosol can to enable \nnon-aerated and gas -only products to be managed as universal wastes, for example by adopting \nthe definition used in international dangerous goods regulations : \n \n   Aerosol or aerosol dispenser means a n article consisting of a  non-refillable receptacle \u2026 \nmade of metal, glass or plastics and containing a gas, compressed, liquefied, or dissolved \nunder pressure, with or without a liquid, paste or powder, and fitted with a release device \nallowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a \nfoam, paste or powder or in a liquid state or in a gaseous state . \n \nSee, e.g. , UN Model Regulations, Section 1.2.1 (Attachment 9).   \n \nWe also urge EPA to delete the requirement that aerosol products be \u201cintact\u201d to be considered \naerosol cans.  This requirement seems unnecessary since the proposal includes a separate \nprovision (discussed further below) excluding aerosol cans that show evid ence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage that could cause leakage from the universal waste rule.  Moreover, inclusion \nof the word \u201cintact\u201d may cause significant confusion by raising questions as to whether the \nstandard for an intact aerosol can is different fr om the standard for determining whether an \naerosol can shows evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage (although \nthe preamble to the proposed rule indicates that the standards are meant to be the same, saying \nthat \u201c[t]hrough this ex clusion [for leaking/damaged aerosol cans], EPA intends that hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans that are not intact  continue to be subject to the full hazardous waste \nstandards,\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660 (emphasis added)).    \n \n 5.2 Exclusion for Leaking/Damage d Aerosols  \n      \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage \nunder reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d   See 52 Fed. Reg. a t 11,665 (proposed to be codified at \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)( 4)).  EPA claims that this exclusion is necessary because \u201cthe proposed \n[universal waste] management standards \u2026 rel[y] in part on the fact that the aerosol cans to be \nmanaged \u2026  are not leaking or otherwise damaged [in a way] where contents or propellants \ncould be dispersed \u2026 [or where there might be] an increased risk of fire.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  As \ndiscussed below, this exclusion is inconsistent with the current rules for other universal wastes, it \n                                                 \n13  See, e.g. , Ohio Admin. Code  3745 -273-09(A) (\u201c\u2018Aerosol container\u2019 means a non -opening, non -refillable \ncontainer that holds a substance under pressure and that can release the substance as a spray, gel, or foam by means \nof a propellant gas\u201d (emphasis added)); Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, \u201cUniversal Wastes\u201d (February 2018) \n(Publication w -hw4-62) (Attachment 11) (stating that aerosols \u201cmay \u2026 be managed as universal waste\u201d and \ndefining them as \u201cpressuriz ed containers used to dispense liquid  or gaseous  products\u201d (emphasis added)).   \n \n- 17 - \n \n \nis not necessary to protect human health and the environment, and it is so vague and potentially \nsusceptible to overly broad interpretation that it could potentially undermine the entire rule.  \n \nAs an initial matter, EPA\u2019s conclusion  about the need for this exclusion  is inconsistent with the \ncurrent rules for other universal wastes.  N one of the existing federal universal waste rules for \nother products exclude leaking or damaged products.  Instead, the rules simply require more \nprotec tive packaging for leaking/damaged products:  \n \no For batteries, handlers \u201cmust contain any universal waste battery that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions\u201d in a container that is \u201cc losed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents \nof the battery, and \u2026 lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions .\u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(a)(1) and \n273.33(a)(1).   \n \no Universal waste pesticides must be contained in a container that is \u201c closed, structurally \nsound, compatible with the pesticide, and that lacks evidence of leakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ,\u201d or in a \ncontain er that does not meet these standards ( e.g., a leaking container), \u201c provided that the \nunacceptable container is overpacked in a container that does meet the requirements .\u201d  \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( b)(1)-(2) and 273.33( b)(1)-(2).           \n \no Handler s of universal waste mercury -containing equipment \u201c must place in a container \nany [such] equipment with non -contained elemental mercury or that shows evidence of \nleakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions ,\u201d and the container must be \u201cclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the \ncontents of the device, must lack evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions, and must be reasonably designed \nto preve nt the escape of mercury into the environment by volatilization or any other \nmeans. \u201d  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( c)(1) and 273.33( c)(1). \n \no With respect to universal waste lamps, handler s \u201cmust place in a container any lamp that \nshows evidence of breakage, le akage, or damage that could cause the release of mercury \nor other hazardous constituents to the environment ,\u201d and such c ontainers must be \u201cclosed, \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the lamps and must lack evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of mercury or other \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foreseeable conditions. \u201d   \nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13( d)(2) and 273.33( d)(2). \n \nEPA has provided no meaningful rationale for departing fr om this approach for aerosol cans.  \nNor do we believe any such rationale exists.  Just as with leaking/damaged batteries, pesticide \ncontainers (which may include some aerosol cans), mercury -containing equipment, and lamps, \nleaking/damaged aerosol cans can safely be managed as universal wastes if they are packaged in \nsuitably protective containers ( e.g., containers that are closed, structurally sound, compatible \nwith the contents of the aerosols, and lack evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could \n \n- 18 - \n \n \ncause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions ).  The use of protective containers is \nalready required for all aerosol cans under EPA\u2019s proposed rule.14  Thus, there is n o need to \nexclude leak ing/damaged aerosol cans.15 \n    \nMoreover, the criteria that E PA proposes for determining when aerosol cans would be excluded \nare so vague that they would create confusion in the regulated community and invite arbitrary \nenforcement by regulators, effectively undermining the benefits of the entire universal waste rule  \nfor aerosol cans.  We recognize that the criteria are similar to the standards that currently trigger \nmore protective packaging for other universal wastes ( i.e., whether the aerosol cans \u201c show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leak age under reasonably foreseeable \nconditions \u201d).  However, the criteria are uniquely problematic for aerosol cans, in part because \naerosol cans \u2013 unlike other universal waste items (with the exception of aerosol pesticides and \nperhaps some other types of pes ticide containers) \u2013 are designed specifically to disperse \nchemical products.  It is not uncommon for aerosol containers to have on the outside dried \nsplatters or drips of the chemical products they dispersed during use ( e.g., due to failure to shake \nthe cans properly prior to use, overspray in a confined area, backspray in a windy area, a \ndefective nozzle, or sputtering as the aerosol can neared the end of its useful life).  However, \nregulators or inspectors could potentially view such splatters or drips as \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage\u201d making the cans ineligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nIn addition, in the absence of certainty about how the splatters/drips will be viewed be regulators \nor inspectors, some generators/hand lers might conservatively assume that all aerosol cans \nbearing these marks should be handled as full y regulated  (non-universal) hazardous wastes.  \nBecause many, if not most, used cans will have such splatters/drips, the universal waste rule for \naerosol can s could effectively become unusable, thereby  undermining all the potential benefits of \nthe proposed rule . \n \nSimilar issues would arise in a variety of other situations.  Aerosol cans that are fully intact may \nnevertheless show evidence of corrosion \u2013 especi ally if the chemical products they contained and \ndispersed are corrosive ( e.g., certain cleaning products) and/or if they are stored for extended \nperiods in damp conditions.  Aerosol cans may also have missing actuator buttons, for a variety \nof reasons tha t have nothing to do with their basic structural integrity, such as that the actuators \nmay have fallen off ( e.g., if they were not attached correctly to begin with), they may have \ninadvertently been knocked off during handling or use, or they may have been  intentionally \nremoved ( e.g., under proposed \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(2)(iii) and 273.33(e)(2)(iii), which authorize \n                                                 \n14  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,666 (proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(1) and 273.33(e)(1)) \n(proposing to require han dlers to accumulate universal waste aerosol cans \u201cin a container that is structurally sound, \ncompatible with the contents of the aerosol cans, and lacks evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause \nleakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions\u201d).   \n \n15  Further protections for leaking/damage d aerosols are also provided by other regulatory regimes, such as the \nDOT hazardous materials transport regulations and local fire codes (as discussed generally in Section 4 above in the \ncontext of Criterion #5).  For example, the DOT rules require that ae rosols that are damaged, defective, or leaking to \nthe point where they do not meet applicable design standards must be transported in special aerosol salvage drums \nmarked \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE\u201d or \u201cAEROSOL SALVAGE DRUM.\u201d  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(k)(2).  Inasmuch \nas DOT has determined that such salvage drums are protective during transport (including storage incidental to \ntransport), there is no reason to exclude these aerosol cans from the universal waste rule.           \n \n- 19 - \n \n \nhandlers to \u201c[r]emov[e] actuators to reduce the risk of accidental release \u201d).  In addition, intact \naerosols may be dented or scratched (more so than ot her universal wastes, like lamps which \nwould generally break rather dent, or batteries that do not have a gas -filled cavity and are more \nsolid/dense).  Any one of these conditions could potentially be viewed as \u201c leakage, spillage, or \ndamage \u201d under the prop osed rule, which might prevent the aerosol cans from being managed as \nuniversal wastes.  In this way, EPA\u2019s proposed exclusion has the potential to become the \nexclusion that swallows the entire rule.  \n \n 5.3 Exclusion for Empty Aerosols    \n \nThe proposed rule would exclude from the applicability of the universal waste program \n\u201c[a]erosol cans that meet the standard for empty containers.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,66 5  \n(proposed to be codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3) ).  EPA explains in the preamble that \u201c[a]n \naerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR 261.7 is not subject to \nhazardous waste regulation, and may be recycled as scrap metal.\u201d  Id. at 11,660.  The Agency \nstates that the exclusion  applies to  \u201caerosol cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product).\u201d  Id.  The Retail Associations  have several concerns with this part of the \nproposal.  \n \nFirst, even though EPA states in the preamble that empty aerosol cans are \u201cnot subject to \nhazardous waste regulation,\u201d th e Agency in the past has indicated that empty aerosols might \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity and thus remain subject to hazardous waste regulation.  See \nEPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) (Attachment 12) \n(\u201cIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the aerosol cans [may] be a RCRA hazardous waste \nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  As discussed in Section 8  \nbelow, we do not believe that any aerosol cans \u2013 much less emp ty aerosol cans \u2013 qualify as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  However, if any empty aerosols are deemed to be reactive, the \nexclusion of empty cans from the universal waste rule could potentially be interpreted to mean \nthat such \u201creactive\u201d empty cans would have  to be managed as full y regulated (non-universal) \nhazardous wastes.16  Such a result would make no sense, given that full or partially full aerosol \n                                                 \n16  We note that t here is some uncertainty with respect to this point, because of the confusing way that the \nexclusions in proposed 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b) are structured.  That provision states that the requirements of the \nuniversal waste rule do not apply to aerosol cans tha t (1) are not wastes, (2) are non -hazardous, (3) are empty, or (4) \nshow evidence of leakage, spillage or damage.  It is our understanding that for the first two categories ( i.e., aerosol \ncans that are not waste or are non -hazardous), EPA\u2019s intent is that g enerators would not be required  to handle the \ncans as universal wastes, but would allowed  to do so (or to handle the cans completely outside the RCRA regulatory \nprogram).  On the other hand, for the last category ( i.e., cans with evidence of leaking or dam age), the Agency\u2019s \nintent apparently is that generators would be prohibited  from handling the cans as universal wastes (and would have \nto handle them as fully regulated hazardous wastes, assuming they are solid and hazardous wastes).  Thus, the \n\u201cexclusions \u201d for these categories apparently are intended to mean very different things.   \n \nFor aerosol cans that are empty and non -reactive (which, as noted above, we believe would include all empty cans), \nEPA presumably intends the exclusion to operate in the same manner as for the first two categories, i.e., to mean \nthat generators are not required  to handle the cans as universal wastes, but are allowed  to do so (or to handle the \ncans completely outside the RCRA regulatory program).  However, to the extent EPA may believe that any empty \naerosol cans are reactive (which, as noted above, we do not believe is the case), it seems unlikely that the Agency \nwould intend the exclusion to work the same way (since that would allow \u201creactive\u201d empty cans to be managed \n \n- 20 - \n \n \ncans exhibiting the reactivity characteristic (to the extent that any such cans might be deemed by \nEPA to be reactive) would be eligible for management under the universal waste rule.  \nMoreover, if \u201creactive\u201d empty aerosol cans cannot be managed as universal wastes, retailers and \nother generators would have to identify and segregate such cans so that the rest cou ld be \nmanaged as universal wastes \u2013 an almost impossible task, especially given the lack of clarity \nabout what constitutes an empty aerosol and/or a reactive aerosol, as well as the generally limited \nexperience and high turnover of personnel in the retail sector.    \n \nWe doubt that EPA intended such results from its proposed exclusion of empty aerosols.  \nPerhaps the Agency intended its statement in the preamble that empty aerosols are \u201cnot subject \nto hazardous waste regulation\u201d to clarify that empty container s are not subject to regulation as \nreactive hazardous wastes.  If so, we support such a clarification, but ask EPA to make this point \nmore explicit, so as to avoid any potential confusion.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the \n1987 EPA guidance refe renced above did not actually conclude  that empty aerosols could be \nreactive, but rather responded to a question that was posed to the Agency assum ing that they \ncould be reactive.  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027) \n(Attachm ent 12) (\u201c[W]ould aerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still  potentially reactive \nbecause of contained  propellant be  regulated as hazardous waste?\u201d).   Thus, a statement now that \nempty aerosol cans are not reactive would not actually reverse prior EPA guidance.  And, as \ndiscussed in Section 8  below, it would be supported by the fact that even full or partially full \naerosols are not properly viewed as reactive.   \n \nA second problem with EPA\u2019s proposal on empty aerosol cans is that it provides no clear \nstandard for when an aerosol can qualifies as empty such that it would be excluded from the \nuniversal waste rule.  The proposed regulatory exclusion covers \u201c[a]erosol c ans that meet the \nstandard for empty containers  under part [sic] 261.7.\u201d  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 11,665  (proposed to \nbe codified at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.6(b)(3)) ; see also id . at 11,660 (addressing \u201c aerosol can [s] that \nmeet [ ] the definition of empty container in  40 CFR 261.7 \u201d).  However, EPA has long side -\nstepped the issue of when aerosol cans qualify as empty under Section 261.7, leaving generators \nwithout any meaningful standard to apply.17   \n \n                                                 \ncompletel y outside the RCRA regulatory program).  For these aerosol cans, EPA might intend the exclusion to \noperate in the same way as the exclusion for damaged/leaking aerosol cans, such that the \u201creactive\u201d empty cans \nwould have to be managed as fully regulated ha zardous wastes, rather than as universal wastes.  This is the potential \ninterpretation discussed in the main text above.  However, it is possible that EPA may intend the exclusion for \n\u201creactive\u201d empty cans to operate in yet a third (unspecified) way.         \n     \n17  See, e.g. , Letter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to John DiFazio, \nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11780)  (\u201cDenit Letter #1) \n(Attachment 13) (\u201cWe have \u2026 been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of \n\u2018empty\u2019 under 40 CFR 261.7.  \u2026 [I]f the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to determine whether they \nare \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria listed in 40 CF R 261.7. \u2026 However, in order to dispose of a can as non -hazardous \nwaste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to determine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7\u201d); \nLetter from Jeffrey D. Denit, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Gregory L. Crawford, Vice President, \nRecycling Operations, Steel Recycling Institute (October 7, 1993) (RCRA Online #11782) (\u201cDenit Letter #2) \n(Attachment 14) (same).   \n \n \n- 21 - \n \n \nMoreover, the preamble to the proposed rule further muddies an alread y muddy picture by \nintroducing a new standard for \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans and conflating it with a standard previously \noffered by the Agency for entirely different purposes.  In particular, EPA states in the preamble \nthat the proposed exclusion covers \u201caeroso l cans that have been emptied of their contents (both \npropellant and product),\u201d see 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660, even though this standard is not in the \nproposed regulatory text, has no precedent we are aware of, and leaves unanswered what it \nmeans to be emptie d of propellant and product.  In addition, EPA states in the preamble that \nempty aerosol cans as defined under 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7 \u201cmay be recycled as scrap metal,\u201d even \nthough past Agency guidance states that the standard for recycling aerosol cans as scrap metal is \nwhether they \u201c contain a significant amount of  liquid ,\u201d not whether they meet the standard of \nempty in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7.  See, e.g. , Denit Letter #1 (\u201cif the [aerosol] cans are being recycled, \nit is not necessary to determine whether they are \u2018empty\u2019 under the criteria in 40 CFR 261.7.  As \nlong as an aerosol can being recycled does not contain significant liquids, t he can is exempt as \nscrap metal\u201d); Denit Letter #2 (same).  Complicating matters even further, EPA has previously \nstated that one way  to ensure an aerosol can does not contain a significant amount of liquid is by \npuncturing and draining it, id., which  has left the misimpression in the minds of some  that this is \nthe only way  to achieve this standard.  And, by blurring the distinction between th e \u201cno \nsignificant liquids\u201d standard and the definition of empty container, EPA may be leaving the \nmisimpression that  the only way to render an aerosol can empty is by puncturing and draining it.   \n \nIn light of the above, the Retail Associations urge EPA to clarify that empty aerosol cans are not \nreactive and thus do not have to be managed as either universal or hazardou s wastes (although \nthey may be managed as universal wastes on a voluntary basis), and further to clarify when \naerosol cans qualify as empty (including, but not limited to the fact that emptying does not \nrequire puncturing and draining).   We elaborate furth er on the guidance needed on these and \nrelated issues in Section 8 below.  \n \n6. EPA Should Clarify That As Soon As It Finalizes the Proposed Rule, Aerosol Can \nWastes May Be Transported in All States Without a Hazardous Waste Manifest or \na Hazardous Waste Transporter  \n \nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA indicates that the designation of hazardous aerosol can \nwastes as universal wastes under the federal regulations would not take effect in authorized states \nunless and until such states adopted the same de signation under state law.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at \n11,662 -63.  Moreover, because such designation would generally make the state programs less \nstringent  than they currently are  (except in the case of the few states that already designate \naerosol cans as unive rsal wastes), the states \u201cwould not have to adopt the universal waste \nregulations for aerosol cans.\u201d  Id. at 11,663.  These statements leave open the possibility that \nsome states may never adopt the universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and/or that there may be \nan extended period of time during which there will be a patchwork of regulation for aerosol \ncans.18 \n                                                 \n18  To minimize this patchwork and fully realize the benefits of a universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, we ask EPA to encourage states to quickly adopt the new rule, as the Agency has done for previous \nuniversal waste rules.  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,53 6 (May 11, 1995) (final original universal waste rule)  \n(\u201cEven though States are not required to adopt today\u2019s rule, EPA strongly encourages them to do so\u201d) ; 64 Fed. Reg. \n \n- 22 - \n \n \n \nThe proposed rule does not address how this patchwork will work.  However, this issue is of \nvital importance, especially to retailers and other gener ators that may be generating hazardous \naerosol can wastes in multiple states, to persons developing/operating national or regional \ncollection and recycling/disposal programs for aerosol can wastes , and to generators and \ntransporters moving aerosol cans across state lines to appropriate destination facilities .  Of \nparticular importance are the requirements (if any) that may apply to the transport of such wastes \nfrom, to, or through states that have not yet (or never will) classify aerosol cans as universa l \nwastes.  \n \nAs discussed below, EPA has previously addressed essentially the same issue in the context of \nother universal waste rules.  However, when it has done so, it has ignored relevant law and the \nAgency\u2019s own guidance, and arrived at a conclusion that  inappropriately and unnecessarily \nundermined implementation of the universal waste rule.  The Retail Associations urge the \nAgency to rectify the situation by clarifying, once and for all, that once a waste is designated as a \nuniversal waste under federal law, the waste may be transported nationwide without a hazardous \nwaste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.  \n \nIn prior universal waste rulemakings, EPA has stated that federally designated universal wastes \nremain subject to full hazardous waste regula tion as long as they are in states that have not (yet) \nadopted the federal universal waste rule, with the result being that transport from, through, or to \nsuch a state must be performed by a hazardous waste transporter and must be accompanied by a \nhazardou s waste manifest.19  However, these statements overlook ed the fact that federal rules for \ntransportation of hazardous materials (including hazardous wastes) generally preempt state rules \nthat are more stringent.   \n \n                                                 \n36,466, 36,4 72 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps)  (\u201cEPA hopes to encourage  \u2026 states to regulate \nspent lamps  as universal waste an d therefore  promote greater consistency in  regulatory approaches across state  \nborders \u201d); 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,516 (August 5, 2005) (final universal waste rule for mercury -containing \nequipment)  (\u201c[states] do not have to adopt the universal waste regulati ons \u2026 although EPA encourages them to do \nso\u201d).   \n \nMoreover, we ask EPA, as it has done in the past for other universal wastes, to state its intention not to take \nenforcement actions involving hazardous aerosol can wastes  managed in accordance with the universal waste rule, \neven if the relevant state has not yet adopted the rule or received authorization for the rule.  See, e.g. , Memorandum \nfrom Steve Herman, Assistant Administrator, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Ass urance, EPA, and Elliott P. \nLaws, Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA, to EPA Regional \nAdministrators (April 10, 1996) (RCRA Online #11960) (Attachment 15) (\u201cBy finalizing 40 C.F.R. Part 273, EPA \nhas taken the positio n that managing wastes in compliance with those standards is environmentally protective.  \nTherefore, \u2026 Regions should take enforcement actions involving universal wastes only where handlers of such \nwastes are not in full compliance with the Part 273 standa rds\u201d); Memorandum from Mike Shapiro, Director, Office \nof Solid Waste, EPA, to Senior RCRA Policy Managers, EPA Regions I -X (February 13, 1997) (RCRA Online \n#14088) (Attachment 16) (same).  \n \n19  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,537 -38 (May 11, 1995) (final  original universal waste rule); 64 Fed. Reg. \n36,466, 36,482 -83 (July 6, 1999) (final universal waste rule for lamps); 70 Fed. Reg. 45,508, 45,516 -17 (August 5 , \n2005) (final universal waste rule for mercury -containing equipment).   \n \n \n- 23 - \n \n \nEPA itself has previously noted  the preemp tive effect of federal rules for transport of hazardous \nwastes, stating for example that  \u201c[even though] p reemption authorities are quite foreign to \nRCRA [ they] are introduced into the transporter arena by the statutory directive in RCRA to \nmain tain consist ency with the DOT framework [for transportation of hazardous materials  under \nthe Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (\u201cHMTA\u201d) ].\u201d20  Indeed, e ven state hazardous waste \ntransport requirements that have been authorized by EPA pursuant to RCRA are not immune  to \npre-emption under the HMTA.21   \n \nIn the present case, if  hazardous aerosol can wastes are classified as universal wastes, any state \nrules requiring such items to be shipped as ordinary hazardous wastes would be preempted.  \nConsider, for example, the req uirement that hazardous wastes be transported with a manifest.  \nUnder EPA\u2019s proposed rule, hazardous aerosol can wastes would not have to be shipped with a \nmanifest for purposes of federal law.  The HMTA explicitly provides that state shipping paper \nrequir ements (including manifest requirements) are preempted if they are not \u201csubstantively the \nsame\u201d as the corresponding federal requirements.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5125(b)(1)(C).  DOT has \nclarified that, under this standard, state requirements must \u201cconform[  ] in every significant \nrespect to the Federal requirement.\u201d  See 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 107.202(d).  Thus, any state manifest \nrequirements for aerosol cans  would clearly be preempted.  \n \nAs EPA itself stated in 1984, federal law \u201cprohibit[s] States from requiring separate State \nmanifests or other information to accompany  waste shipments  [if such documents or information \nare not required by federal law] .\u201d22  DOT echoed these statements in its own 1984 not ice, saying \nthat \u201cno carrier could be required to carry  any State manifest form that differs from the EPA \n                                                 \n20  See Letter from Mich ael Shapiro, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Richard J.

As in the case of state manifest requiremen ts, state rules governing packaging, \nlabeling, or release reporting during transportation are explicitly preempted if they differ in any \nrespect from the federal rules.  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7  5125(b)(1)(B), (D).  State rules for licensing or \nregistration of tra nsporters are also preempted if they operate as an \u201cobstacle\u201d to the goals of the \nfederal hazardous materials law.26  Of course, state rules related to handling of aerosol cans at \nstationary facilities will generally not be preempted, because they do not in volve transportation .27       \n \nThe Retail Associations recognize that EPA may be inclined to defer on the issue of preemption \nto the department that is responsible for implementing the federal hazardous materials \ntransportation law (i.e., DOT).  However, EPA\u2019s prior statements on interstate transport  of \nuniversal wastes have sufficiently clouded the issue that it is now essential that the Agency set \nthe record straight (in consultation with DOT, if necessary).  EPA, in fact, has been willing to do \nso in the past.28  The Agency should be eager to do so in the current case, because preemption \nwill significantly advance the goal of facilitating nationwide recycling of aerosol cans .  At a \nminimum, EPA should disavow the statements in prior universal waste rules, a nd clarify that \nthey were not intended to represent determinations that state rules requiring hazardous waste \nmanifests or hazardous waste transporters were not preempted.    \n                                                 \n23  See 49 Fed.

(\u201cwhile [the uniform manifest rules] do not \nprohibit the transporter from voluntarily carrying [additional] information, they do preclude States from requiring \nthe transporter to do so\u201d).   \n \n24  See, e.g. , 60 Fed. Reg. 62,527, 62,53 7-38 (December 6, 1995) (New York regulations requiring additional \nmanifest information are preempted, because there are no corresponding federal requirements); 58 Fed. Reg. 11,176 \n(February 23, 1993) (Illinois regulations requiring a different format for providing information on the manifest are \npreempted).   \n \n25  See 62 Fed. Reg. 1208 (January 8, 1997) (expanding the scope of the hazardous materials regulations to \ncover intrastate shipments, consistent with a 1990 amendment to the federal hazardous materials transportation law \ncodified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7  5103(b)(1)).  \n \n26  See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7  5125(a)(2); Colorado Public Utilities Commission v. Harmon , 951 F.2d 1571 (10th Cir. \n1991) (Colorado permit requirements for hazardous material transporters are preempted  because they are an obstacle \nto the congressional goal of promoting safety through uniform standards).   \n \n27  One possible exception relates to loading, unloading, and storage activities that are incidental to \ntransportation.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 61,906, 61,9 38 (October 30, 2003) (revising 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 171.1(c) to clarify that \ntransportation includes loading, unloading, and storage incidental to transportation) and 61,923 -24 (explaining that \nstate and local requirements related to these activities may be preemp ted). \n \n28  See, e.g.,  49 Fed. Reg. at 10,495 (\u201cStates through which hazardous waste shipments pass are not allowed to \nplace additional information requirements on the transporter as a condition of transportation.\u201d); RCRA/CERCLA \nHotline Report (May 1985) (RC RA Online #12399)  (Attachment 19) (\u201cStates through which [a] waste shipment \ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements.\u201d).   \n \n- 25 - \n \n \n \nFinally, the Retail Associations recognize that EPA may also be reluctant to add ress the \npreemption issue due to concerns about the potential reactions of state regulatory agencies.  \nAlthough such agencies may generally be protective of their sovereign authority, we believe that, \nin the present case, they generally recognize the benefits of uniform national regulations for \nhazardous aerosol can wastes.  Indeed, they may welcome preemption as important step forward \nin meeting recycling goals for such wastes .  Moreover, EPA would not be establishing new law \nby addressi ng the preemption issue.  Rather, it would simply be recognizing that, under existing \nlaw, the effect of the new federal universal waste rule  for hazardous aerosol can wastes would be \nto preempt more stringent state rules for transportation of such wastes . \n \n7. EPA\u2019s Regulatory Impact Analysis Dramatically Underestimates the Potential Cost \nSavings That Would Be Achieved Under the Universal Waste Rule   \n \nIn the Regulatory Impact Analysis (\u201cRIA\u201d) for the proposed rule, EPA\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d analysis \nestimates that the costs savings associated with the proposal would be only $3.0 to $3.5 million \nper year.  See RIA at 24.  The Agency also includes an \u201calternative\u201d analysis in an appendix, \nwhich results in an estimate of $56.7 to $63.3 million per year, but discounts this analysis by \nsaying that \u201cthe analysis presented in this appendix \u2026 may overestimate cost savings.\u201d  Id. at 48 -\n49.  As discussed below, EPA\u2019s primar y analysis dramatically underestimates the likely cost \nsavings, in part because it fails to take into account the unique characteristics of affected \nfacilities in the retail sector, which the Agency itself acknowledges represent about two -thirds of \nthe uni verse of affected hazardous waste generators.  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655.  Indeed, even \nEPA\u2019s alternative analysis likely understates the cost savings significantly.  \n \nThroughout the RIA, EPA notes that the \u201ccost savings [under the proposal] are largely \nattributable to facilities changing generator status as a result of no longer having to count aerosol \ncans towards their HW [hazardous waste] generator status.\u201d  See RIA at ES -4, 24, and 47.  The \nRetail Associations  agree, but take issue with the Agency\u2019s es timates of the number of facilities \nexpected to change generator status, especially under the primary analysis.  According to that \nanalysis, only about 500 facilities nationwide across all industries would change generator status \nunder the proposal, repres enting less than 0.8% of the aerosol -generating L arge Quantity \nGenerator (\u201cL QG\u201d) universe and 3.7% of the aerosol -generating S mall Quantity Generator \n(\u201cSQG\u201d) universe.  Id. at ES -4 and 19.  However, these figures seem extremely  low.  Some \nindividual retail  companies are likely to have more than 500 facilities  change generator status as \na result of a universal waste rule for aerosol cans, and the number across the entire retail sector \nwould clearly be many times that figure (not even counting the number of f acilities in other \nindustries).  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Retail Associations and the retail sector as a \nwhole ha ve been urging the Agency so strongly over the last several years to classify and \nregulate aerosol cans as universal wastes.  \n \nBased on our review of the RIA, we believe there are three main sources of EPA\u2019s error, each of \nwhich is discussed briefly below:  \n \n \n- 26 - \n \n \no Use of  SQG  Data Skewed Heavily to the Manufacturing Sector .  EPA apparently \nestimated the percentage of SQGs that would become  VSQGs under the proposal by \nreviewing the admittedly very limited data on SQGs in its 2015 Biennial Report (\u201cBR\u201d) \ndatabase, and determining for each SQG facility in that database how the exclusion of \naerosol cans from counting toward the SQG threshold mig ht affect the status of the \nfacility.  See RIA at 18 (explaining the methodology) and 8 (explaining that the BR \ndatabase is a \u201csignificant underrepresentation\u201d of the SQG universe, because \u201conly LQGs \nare required to make BR submissions\u201d).  However, the BR data on SQGs are heavily \nskewed toward the manufacturing sector.  Only 8% of the aerosol -generating SQGs in the \nBR database are from the retail sector, even though EPA itself acknowledges that the \nsector represents fully 65% of the aerosol -generating unive rse.29  In contrast, almost half \nof the aerosol -generating SQGs in the BR database are in the manufacturing sector.   See \nRIA at 7.   \n \n In light of the above, EPA\u2019s estimate of the percentage of SQGs that would become \nVSQGs under the proposal  is based primarily on manufacturing facilities, even though \nretail stores represent by far a greater number of affected facilities and have \ncharacteristics that make it far more likely that they will change generator status.  \nMember s of the Retail Associa tions  have reported that aerosol cans frequently account \nfor 50% (by weight) or even more of all the potentially hazardous unsold/returned \nproducts handled by retailers.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 16.  We \nsuspect that few, if any, manufactur ing facilities would have such a high proportion of \naerosol can wastes.  Moreover, given the fundamental difference s in the operations of \nretail stores and manufacturing facilities, we suspect that retail stores in the SQG \ncategory are much more likely to generate waste quantities only slightly above the SQG \nthreshold and/or to exceed that threshold only on an episodic basis.  Taken together, these \ncharacteristics make it much more likely that SQG retail stores would become VSQGs \nunder a universal waste rul e for aerosols.30   \n \nBy basing its estimate of the effects primarily on facilities in the manufacturing sector \n(and in other sectors that likewise are substantially different from the retail sector that \nrepresents the bulk of affected generators), EPA has d ramatically understated the \npercentage of SQGs that would become VSQGs under the proposal .  The effects of this \nerror on the bottom -line estimate of cost savings are very substantial.  EPA\u2019s alternative \nanalysis estimates that approximately 80% of aerosol -generating SQGs will become \nVSQGs under the proposal.  See RIA at 48.  That figure seems much closer to reality, and \n                                                 \n29  See RIA at 7 (indicating that the BR database has only 59 aerosol -generating SQG retail facilities out of a \ntotal 710 aerosol -generating SQG facilities across all industries, which corresponds to 8%); 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655 \n(\u201c[the] top economic sector[ ] \u2026 with the largest percentage of potentially affected entities [is] the retail trade \nindustry \u2026 representing 65% of the affect ed \u2026 universe\u201d).   \n \n30  See, e.g. , Retail Associations NODA Comments at 24, n.26 (\u201cSeveral members of the Retail Associations \n\u2026 estimate that well over half  of their stores would be reclassified as CESQGs if all aerosols were exempted from \n\u2018counting\u2019 for purposes of determining generator status [as would be the case under the universal waste rule]\u201d \n(emphasis added)).  \n \n \n- 27 - \n \n \nby EPA\u2019s estimates would increase the annual cost savings from the $3.0 -$3.5 million \nrange to the $56.7 -$63.3 million  range.  \n \no Failure to  Account for Expected Change in the Status of Large Numbers of Retail \nLQG Facilities under the Upcoming Rule on Low-Concentration Nicotine Products.   \nAs noted above, EPA\u2019s primary analysis projects that only a handful of the estimated \n6520 aerosol -generati ng LQG facilities in the country will change generator status as a \nresult of the proposed rule.   See RIA at ES -4 and 19.   In fact, however, it is likely that \nlarge numbers of these facilities will change status under the universal waste rule for \naerosols.  The reason is that the vast majority of these LQGs (4 ,225, according to EPA\u2019s \nprimary estimate) are retail stores, see id . at 7,  and we believe that most of these facilities \nare LQGs only because they generate more than 1 kg of low -concentration nicotine \nproducts ( e.g., nicotine gum, lozenges, patches, prescription liquids, and e -cigarettes), \nwhich are currently classified as acutely hazardous wastes under RCRA.31  EPA has \nproposed to reclassify these products as non -acutely hazardous wastes or to exclude t hem \nfrom RCRA regulation, either one of which would likely cause many of these facilities to \nbe reclassified as SQGs.   See 80 Fed. Reg. at 58,071 -73.  Like other SQG retail facilities, \nthese newly -SQG retail facilities would be highly likely to change to V SQG facilities \nunder the universal waste rule for aerosols.   \n \n If these newly -SQG retail facilities are included in the analysis, the effects on the  bottom -\nline estimate of cost savings would be substantial.   EPA has estimated that the annual \ncost savings  per facility of changing from an SQG to a VSQG would be $3600 to $3800 \n(assuming that virtually all of these facilities will be Small Quantity Handlers of \nUniversal Wastes (\u201cSQHUWs\u201d)).  See RIA at 25.  Thus, if there are 3,000 newly -SQG \nretail facilities that would become VSQGs as a result of the universal waste rule for \naerosols,32 the total annual cost savings for these facilities alone would be $10.8 to $11.4 \nmillion \u2013 a few times EPA\u2019s primary estimate of the annual cost savings for the entire \ncountry .  Assuming EPA finalizes its rule on low -concentration nicotine products before \nit finalizes the proposed universal waste rule for aerosols, it should revise its RIA to \naccount for these substantial additional savings.  \n \no Underestimate of Baseline Numbers o f LQG and SQG Facilities Generating Aerosol \nWastes.   EPA\u2019s primary analysis in the RIA estimates that there are currently 6,520 \nLQGs and 13,019 SQGs that generate aerosol can wastes, while the Agency\u2019s alternative \n                                                 \n31  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.33(e) (EPA Hazardo us Waste No. P075) (acute hazardous waste listing for nicotine); \n80 Fed. Reg. 58,014, 58,017 (September 25, 2015) (\u201cunused nicotine patches, gums and lozenges are finished \ndosage forms of nicotine and therefore are regulated as P075 when discarded\u201d); Retai l Associations NODA \nComments at 9 (stating that \u201cMembers of the Retail Associations report that low -[concentration] nicotine products \nare the sole reason why the vast majority of stores handling such products are classified as LQGs\u201d and estimating \nthe numb ers of such facilities in the several thousands).   \n \n32  This figure corresponds to approximately 70% of the 4,225 aerosol -generating retail industry LQGs \nidentified by EPA in its primary analysis.  We note that even if the actual percentage of retail LQGs that would be \naffected in this way is lower than 70%, the 3,000 facility figure may be reasonable, given that EPA\u2019s baseline figure \nof 4,225 retail LQGs generating hazardous aerosol can wastes is probably far too low (as discussed further below).   \n \n- 28 - \n \n \nanalysis estimates the figures at 7,239 an d 14,454, respectively.  See RIA at 19 and 48.  \nThe Retail Associations  believe that these baseline numbers are likely all too low.  With \nrespect to LQGs, the 2013 BR data showed a total of 20,771 LQGs.  See EPA, \n\u201cRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potent ial Costs, Benefits, and Other Impacts of the \nFinal Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule \u201d (September 2016) (\u201cGenerator \nRule RIA\u201d)  (Attachment 20), Exhibit 2 -6.  It seems likely that virtually all of these LQGs \ngenerate at least some aerosol can wast es, if nothing else from cleaning offices and \nbathrooms.  Yet, the current RIA estimates suggest that only about one -third of these \nLQGs generate any aerosol can wastes.  Focusing just on the retail sector, the 2013 BR \ndata showed 5,563 LQGs in the industr y, virtually all in retail categories, such as health \nand personal care stores, that can almost invariably be expected to sell aerosol products \n(and thus to generate significant quantities of aerosol wastes).  Id.  Yet, the current RIA \nestimates that only 4,225 retail LQGs generate aerosol wastes.   \n \n The apparent underestimates are magnified in the RIA, since EPA bases its estimates of \naerosol -generating SQGs on its estimates of aerosol -generating LQGs.  In particular, \nEPA arrived at its SQG estimates by m ultiplying the LQG estimates by a factor of two \n(2.0).  See RIA at 8 -9.  However, there are several reasons to question this methodology.  \nFirst, as noted above, the underlying estimates of the number of aerosol -generating LQGs \nseem low.  Second, in the RI A for the 2016 hazardous waste generator rule, EPA \nestimated that the ratio of SQGs to LQGs was significantly higher, namely between 2.4 \nand 3.1.  See Generator Rule RIA, Exhibit ES -2.  Although these ratios were not focused \nspecifically on aerosol -generat ing generators, there is no apparent reason why the ratios \nwould be significantly different for such generators, as opposed to generators of \nhazardous wastes as a whole.  Third, EPA based its factor of 2.0 on data from just 3 \nstates, and for one of those s tates, the Agency acknowledged that it had to use indirect \n(and probably incomplete) means to identify the relevant facilities.  See RIA at 8.  Fourth, \nEPA in the 2014 NODA estimated that the number of SQGs in the retail sector alone was \n16,774 (virtually all of which would be expected t o generate significant quantities of \naerosol wastes) , which is substantially greater than the number of SQGs that EPA is now \nestimating for all industries  (i.e., 13,019 under the primary analysis, and 14,454 under the \naltern ative analysis) .  See RIA at ES -4 and 19 (estimate from the primary analysis) and \n48 (estimate from the alternative analysis); 79 Fed. Reg. 8,926, 8,932 (February 14, \n2014) (NODA estimate).     \n \n These deviations raise serious questions about EPA\u2019s methodo logy, and suggest that the \nbaseline estimates of the affected universe of generators \u2013 and therefore the ultimate \nestimate of the costs savings \u2013 are substantially too low.  As noted above, even a \nrelatively modest increase in the number of generators whos e status would change under \nthe universal waste rule could increase the expected cost savings by millions of dollars \neach year.  \n \nFor all of the reasons discussed above, the Retail Associations  believe that EPA has dramatically \nunderestimated the likely cos t savings that would result from a universal waste rule for aerosol \n \n- 29 - \n \n \ncans.  Adding up all the estimates discussed above, we believe that the total cost savings will \nlikely be at least $80 million per year, and potentially significantly higher.        \n \n8. EPA Should Follow Through on Its Commitment to Issue Guidance on the Extent to \nWhich Aerosol Cans Are Subject to RCRA Regulation in the First Instance  \n \nAlthough the Retail Associations  believe that EPA\u2019s proposal to classify and regulate hazardous \naerosol can wastes as universal wastes is a major step forward in improving the regulatory \nframework for such materials, we also believe it is imperative for the Agency issue guidance on \nwhen aerosol cans qualify as solid and hazardous wastes, and are subject to R CRA regulation, in \nthe first instance.  Since a t least as far back as 2014, the Retail Associations have stressed that an \neffective strategy for aerosol cans requires not only a universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol \ncan wastes, but also new guidance o n these fundamental issues.  See, e.g. , Retail Associations \nNODA Comments at 20 -25.  At least one of the Associations, RILA , underscored the importance \nof guidance (as well as a universal waste rule) in its 2017 comments on EPA\u2019s regulatory reform \nefforts under Executive Order 13777.  See RILA Regulatory Reform Comments at 8-12.  In its \n2016 Retail Strategy, EPA acknowledged the need for additional guidance, committing, for \nexample, to develop a \u201cguide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subti tle C \nrecycling exclusions .\u201d  See EPA , \u201cStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA\u2019s \nRegulatory Framework \u201d (September 12, 2016) (Attachment 27)  at 6.  We urge EPA to follow \nthrough on this commitment, and would welcome the opportunity to assist the Agency in this \neffort.   EPA should try to issue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste \nrule, if that can be done without dela ying the universal waste rule.  However, the first priority \nshould be to issue a final universal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be \nfollowed up afterwards, if necessary, with the guidance.   \n \nWe believe that guidance is needed on four main issues , each of which is discussed briefly \nbelow:  \n \no Applicability of the Definition of Solid Waste to Aerosol Cans Destined for \nReclamation .  EPA should clarify that aerosol cans (whether full, partially full, or empty) \nare not solid wastes when th ey are destined for reclamation ( e.g., recovery of metals in \nthe housing of the dispenser, useful propellants such as hydrocarbons suitable for use as \nfuel, and/or the chemical products originally intended t o be dispensed).  The Agency has \nlong stated that  aerosol cans, as well as the propellants and chemical products inside, are \n\u201ccommercial chemical products.\u201d33  As commercial chemical products, the aerosol cans \n                                                 \n33  See, e.g., Memorandum from Sylvia K. Lowrance, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Karl E.  \nBremer, Chief, RCRA Permitting Branch, EPA Region 5 (December 30, 1992) (RCRA Online #11717)  (\u201cLowrance \nMemorandum\u201d) (Attachment 21) (\u201cthe remaining propellants in  the cans [are] unused \u2026 [and] would be classified \nas commercial chemical products\u201d ); id.

Lowrance, Director, Office of Solid Waste, \nEPA, to Kurt E. Whitman, Project Coordinator, SWInc. (September 30, 1988) (RCRA Online #13225)  (Attachment \n22) (\u201c[aerosol] cans are hazardous [under the commercial chemical product listings] if \u2026 they contain a commercial \nchemical pr oduct on the 40 CFR 261.33(e) or (f) lists\u201d) ; Denit Letter #2 (Attachment 14) (\u201cliquids or contained \ngases removed from aerosol cans may be \u2026 listed in Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 261,\u201d where the only potentially \nrelevant listings would be the commercial chem ical product listings); Denit Letter #1 (Attachment 13) (same).   \n \n- 30 - \n \n \nare classified as non -wastes under the RCRA regulations if they are destined for \nreclamation .34  Importantly, EPA has explicitly stated that a material may be legitimately \nreclaimed even if only non -hazardous components are being recovered.35  Thus, even if \nthe aerosol cans are being reclaimed only to recover non -hazardous components such as \nthe metal housings, the cans are properly classified as commercial chemical products \ndestined for reclamation, and thus not solid or hazardous wastes.36 \n   \no Potential Reactivity of Aerosol Cans .  EPA has long suggested that waste aerosol cans, \nwhether full or empty,  have the potential to qualify as reactive hazardous wastes on the \nbasis that they are \u201ccapable of detonation or explosive reaction if [they are] subjected to a \nstrong initiating source or if heated under confinement.\u201d37  However, as the Retail \nAssociations  have demonstrated, aerosol cans do not, in fact, exhibit the reactivity \ncharacteristic.  See generally  Retail Associations NODA Comments at 20 -23.   \n \n                                                 \n \n34  See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(3) (listed commercial chemical products  are not solid wastes when destined for \nreclamation ); 50 Fed. Reg. 14,216, 14,219 (April 11, 1985) (specifying that the ru les for listed commercial chemical \nproducts also apply to characteristic commercial chemical products) ; see also  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1(c)(4)  (defining \nreclamation to include \u201cprocess[ing] to recover a usable product\u201d ). \n \n35  See, e.g. , 73 Fed. Reg. 64,668, 64,74 5 (October 30, 2008) (stating that \u201c[i]t has been the Agency\u2019s \nlongstanding policy that \u2026 not every constituent or component in a hazardous secondary material would have to \ncontribute \u2026 to the recycling process,\u201d and indeed \u201cthe non -hazardous component of hazardous secondary materials \n[can] provide the useful contribution\u201d; also citing as examples the use/recovery of non -hazardous glass from lead -\ncontaining cathode ray tubes, and the use/recovery of non -hazardous zinc from certain hazardous secondary \nmateri als); 78 Fed. Reg. 46,448, 46,462 (July 31, 2013) (stating that \u201cEPA\u2019s long -standing policy regarding \nlegitimate recycling does not require that 100% of the hazardous secondary material be reclaimed in order to be \nlegitimately recycled,\u201d and concluding tha t solvent -contaminated wipes destined to be laundered to \nrecover/regenerate the fabric cloth are being legitimately reclaimed, even though the hazardous solvents are being \ndiscarded).   \n \n36  At a minimum, EPA should clarify that aerosol cans containing non -hazardous chemical products and \nignitable propellants that are commonly used as fuels ( e.g., propane and butane) are not hazardous wastes if they are \ndestined for reclamation to recover the propellants for use as fuels or for use in making fuels.  As the Retail \nAssociations explained in detail in comments on the 2014 NODA, none of the components of these products are \nsubject to RCRA regulation.  See Retail Associations NODA Comments at 23 -25.  The chemical product intended to \nbe dispensed in this situation  is non -hazardous, and thus clearly not a RCRA hazardous waste.  The metal housing \nlikewise is non -hazardous (and would be excluded or exempt from regulation if it were also reclaimed).  Moreover, \nEPA has clearly stated that the only remaining component \u2013 the propellant \u2013 would not be a solid waste.  See \nLowrance Memorandum  (Attachment 21) (\u201cSince [butane and propane propellants] are fuels and being burned for \nenergy recovery, they would not fall within the definition of a solid waste and would consequentl y not be considered \nhazardous wastes\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.2(c)(2)(ii) (commercial chemicals products destined to be used as fuels or to \nmake fuels \u201care not solid wastes if they are themselves fuels\u201d).  Inasmuch as none of the components would be solid \nor haz ardous wastes, the aerosol cans would also not be subject to RCRA regulation.  \n \n37  See EPA, RCRA Hotline Report (September 1987) (RCRA Online #13027)  (Attachment 12) (\u201cIrrespective \nof the lack of contained waste, \u2026 aerosol cans [c]ould be a RCRA hazardous w aste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous characteristic of reactivity\u201d); 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.23(a)(6) (supposedly relevant part of the definition of \nreactivity).   \n \n \n- 31 - \n \n \n In general, DOT requirements for the design, manufacture, and testing of aerosol cans \nensure that the pr oducts will not burst \u2013 much less explode or detonate \u2013 when heated to \nthe types of temperatures contemplated by the RCRA reactivity characteristic ( e.g., 140\u00b0F \nor 160\u00b0F), or when subjected to the types of initiating sources contemplated by the \ncharacteris tic (e.g., jostling, bumping, tipping, and dropping).38  Moreover, EPA has long \nstated that the reactivity characteristic is intended to capture only a \u201cfairly narrow \ncategory of wastes\u201d that are \u201cclearly\u201d hazardous, even \u201cto the generator\u2019s own \noperations. \u201d39  Aerosol cans do not exhibit any of these indicia of reactivity, given that \nthey are ubiquitously generated and EPA itself has expressed uncertainty about when \naerosol s might be reactive.40  Thus, we urge EPA to issue guidance cla rifying that aerosol \ncans do not exhibit the RCRA characteristic of reactivity.             \n \no Point at Which Aerosol Cans Are \u201cEmpty.\u201d    As EPA noted in the preamble to the \nproposed rule, \u201c[a]n aerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 40 CFR \n261.7 is not subject to hazardous waste regulation.\u201d  See 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660.   \nHowever, it is unclear under the referenced definition when aerosol cans qualify as \nempty.  For this  reason, we urge EPA to provide  guidance on this issue.  In general, we \nbelieve such guidance must provide a practical means for generators to determine when \naerosol cans are empty, recognizing that aerosols are used and/or generated as wastes in \nan extrao rdinarily wide range of circumstances by persons of widely ranging degrees of \nknowledge and experience with hazardous wastes , and that aerosol cans are closed and \nopaque units that prevent direct observation of the contents and limit direct access to the \ncontents.  \n \n                                                 \n38  See, e.g. , 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 173.306(a)(3)(ii) (requiring metal aerosol cans to be \u201ccapable of withstanding without \nbursting a pressure of one and one -half times  the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 130\u00b0F\u201d (emphasis added)); \n\u00a7 173.24(b)(1) (requiring all packagings, including aerosol cans, to be \u201cdesigned, constructed, maintained, filled, \n[their] contents so limited, and closed, so that under conditions normally incident to transportation \u2026 there will be \nno identifiable \u2026 release of hazardous materials to the environment\u201d); Memorandum from John J.

Reg. \n21,648, 21,649 (June 13, 1986) (\u201ccharacteristics define broad classes of wastes that are clearly hazardous\u201d \n(emphasis added)); 45 Fed. Reg. 33,084 , 33,110 (May 19, 1980) (\u201c[m]ost generators of reactive wastes  are aware \nthat their wastes possess this property \u2026 because such wastes are dangerous to the generators\u2019 own operations\u201d).   \n \n40  See, e.g. , Letter from Elizabeth A. Cotsworth, Acting Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to T.L. \nNebrich, Jr., Technical Di rector, Waste Technology Service, Inc. (May 19, 1997) (RCRA Online #14235) \n(Attachment 25) (\u201cOver the past several  years  we have received numerous  questions concerning the regulatory \nstatus of used aerosol cans under the \u2026 hazardous waste regulations.  We are not at this time able to make a \ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range of products \nexhibit the characteristic of reactivity\u201d).  \n   \n \n- 32 - \n \n \nUnder the regulations, aerosol s can and should be deemed empty once they are no longer \ncapable of dispensing the chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for \nthe intended application  (e.g., once the can starts sputtering or other wise delivering an \nuneven spray) .  At that point, \u201c[a]ll waste s have been removed that can be removed using \nthe practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container [ i.e., \nan aerosol can] ,\u201d see 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(i), since it wo uld not be common to keep \nusing an aerosol can once it is no longer dispensing the product properly.  In addition, at \nthat point, the aerosol can would almost certainly contain no more than 1 inch of \nchemical product  inside , as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)(1)(ii), since the chamber \nwith the chemical product is rarely (if ever) more than 8 inches tall and manufacturers \nseem unlikely to design a product that leaves more than 1/8th of the chemical product \nstranded inside after use.  Further, at this point , some significant portion of the propellant \nis likely to have been discharged, and in this sense the pressure would have \n\u201capproache[d] atmospheric,\u201d as specified in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.7(b)( 2).  Thus, there is a \nsolid basis for issuing practical guidance that  an aerosol can qualifies as empty once it \nstops dispensing the chemical product in a proper way.41 \n \no Use of Statistics to Determine the Quantity of Aerosol Cans to be Counted Toward a \nGenerator\u2019s Status.   Under the proposed rule, VSQGs would not have to manage their \nhazardous aerosol can wastes in accordance with the universal waste rule (although they \ncould do so at their option).  We believe that a generator should be able to use statistical \ninformation ( e.g., from similar facilities) to determine the p ercentage of aerosol cans that \nneed to be counted toward the VSQG limit, without making a determination for each \nindividual can as to whether it is a hazardous waste, empty, etc.  EPA has previously \nallowed this type of approach for another situation in wh ich individual wastes of a \nparticular type may be either hazardous or nonhazardous,42 and we urge the Agency to \nconfirm that a similar approach may be used for aerosol cans.    \n \n9. Conclusion      \n \nFor the reasons discussed above,  the Retail Associations  strongly support the classification and \nregulation of hazardous aerosol can wastes as universal wastes under RCRA.  Indeed, we believe \naerosol cans are particularly well suited for addition to the universal waste rule, since they satisfy all \n                                                 \n41  We also urge EPA to issue similar guidance on the issue of when aerosol cans no longer contain \n\u201csignificant liquids,\u201d which (as discussed in Section 5.3 above) is the standard that EPA has established for when \naerosol cans (whether \u201cempty\u201d or not) may be recycled as scrap metal.  \n \n42  See Letter from Michael Shapir o, Director, Office of Solid Waste, EPA, to Lynn L. Bergeson (July 13, \n1995) (RCRA Online #14003) (Attachment 26) (\u201cwe believe that it would be appropri ate for a generator to rely on \n\u2018knowledge \u2019 of the waste \u2026 based on studies done to characterize the freq uency of \u2018hazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze \ngenerated (relative to the generation of \u2018nonhazardous\u2019 spent antifreeze), in order to characterize the total volume of \nhazardous waste generated.  [For example, if] data \u2026 indicate that up to 40% of the spent antifree ze flushed from \nradiators may be hazardous \u2026 it would be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total \nconsolidated volume of spent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60% nonhazardous. \u2026  [T]his \napproach would be appro priate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the purposes of being \neligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators\u201d).    \n \n- 33 - \n \n \nof the criteri a specified in the regulations for classification as universal wastes.  However, we urge \nEPA to expand the scope of its proposal by including non -aerated and gas -only products, by \nremoving or modifying the exclusion for aerosol cans with evidence of leakin g or damage, and by \nclarifying the status of empty aerosol cans.  Such changes are needed to make the rule workable \n(especially for retailers, which EPA estimates represent approximate two -thirds of the affected \ngenerator universe) and to maximize the bene fits of the rule .  The Agency should also clarify that as \nsoon as the final rule is issued, hazardous aerosol can wastes may immediately be transported in all \nstates without a hazardous waste manifest or a hazardous waste transporter.   \n \nWith these changes and clarifications, the cost savings that would result from the rule are likely far \ngreater than EPA estimated in its RIA \u2013 perhaps as great as $80 million per year or more.  Although \nthis would be a major step forward in improving the r egulatory framework for aerosol cans , we \nalso believe it is imp ortant for the Agency issue guidance clarifying (a) that aerosol cans destined \nfor recycling are not solid wastes, (b) that aerosol cans do not exhibit the characteristic of \nreactivity, (c) that aerosol cans qualify as empty once they are no longer capable of dispensing \nthe chemical product in a reliable and steady way as required for the intended application , and \n(d) that generators may use statistical information to determine the quantity of a erosol cans that \nneed to be counted in determining their hazardous waste generator status.  EPA should try to \nissue such guidance before or together with the final universal waste rule, if that can be done \nwithout delaying the universal waste rule.  Howeve r, the first priority should be to issue a final \nuniversal waste rule for hazardous aerosol can wastes, which can be followed up afterwards, if \nnecessary, with the guidance.    \n \nOnce again, we appreciate this opportunity to provide our comments on this pro posed \nrulemaking. We would welcome the opportunity to provide additional input and/or to answer any \nquestions the Agency may have with respect to the points made above.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \n \n \nAusten Jensen  \nVice President, Government Affairs  \nRetail Industry Leade rs Association  \n \n \n\n \n- 34 - \n \n \n \nStephanie K.

These wastes are referred to as universal wastes because, at some point, almost\nevery business and government agencygeneratesthem.Universal wastes in Minnesota are regulated bythe\nMinnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the metropolitan counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin,\nRamsey, Scott, and Washington (Metro Counties).\nUniversal wastes nationwide include:\n\u2022 Batteries\n\u2022 Lamps\n\u2022 Mercury -containing equipment\n\u2022 Pesticidespage 3\npage 3\npage 3\npage 4\nIn Minnesota, three additional types of waste may also be managed as universal waste:\n\u2022 Dentalamalgam being recycled\n\u2022 Pretreated dental wastewaterpage 5\npage 5\n\u2022 Aerosols and compressed gas cylinders page 5\nIfyou do not managethesewastesasuniversal waste, manage them as fully regulated hazardous waste.\nWhat wastes are not universal wastes?\nWaste streamscommonly confused with universal waste include non-hazardous batteries, electronicwaste,\narchitectural paint, and lighting ballasts and small capacitors containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Each\nof these has its own management requirements:\n\u2022 Non-hazardous batteries: Batteriesthat are not hazardous at the time of disposal are not universal\nwaste. Non-hazardous batteriesinclude alkaline, carbon zinc, chloride zinc (commonly labeled heavy\nduty), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), zinc air, lithium batteriesthat are nine volts or less, and higher\nvoltage lithium batteriesthat have been discharged to less than one volt. Although non-hazardous, you\nare still encouraged to recycle them if collection is available.\n\u2022 Electronic waste: Wastes containing circuit boards or cathode raytubes (CRTs) maybe managed in\nMinnesota under the reduced requirements discussed in MPCA fact sheet #w-hw4-15, Managing\nElectronic Wastes, available at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-15.pdf.\n\u2022 Architecturalpaint:Latexandoil-based architecturalpaintand related coatingsgeneratedbyVerySmall\nQuantity Generators (VSQGs) may be transported to paint collection sites as discussed in MPCA fact\nsheet #w-hw4-37a, Architectural Paint, available at\nhttps://www. pca. state. m n. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-37a . pdf.\n\u2022 PCB-containing ballasts and smallcapacitors:Lightingballastsandsmallcapacitorsthatmaycontain\npolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) must be managed under the requirements discussed in MPCA fact\nsheet #w-hw4-48f, Managing PCBs in Ballasts and Small Capacitors, available at\nhttps://www. pca. state. mn. us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-48f. pdf.\nMinnesota Pollution Control Agency February2018 ~ w-hw4-62\n651-296-6300 ~ 800-6573864 or use your preferred relay service ~ Info.pcaC~state.mn.us Available in alternative formats\n\nManaging universal wastes\nA business or government agencythat generates, transports, or stores universal waste is a universal waste\nhandler.

Manage the drained electrolyte as a hazardous waste unless you\nevaluate it asnon-hazardous. For more information on evaluating wastes, see MPCA fact sheet #w-hw1-01,\nEvaluate Waste, at: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw1-01.pdf.\nYou may also discharge universal waste batteriesif you can do so safely using eitherthe method recommended\nby the batterymanufactureror a complete discharge device (CDD). Do not simply short-circuit batteriesto\ndischarge them; it may cause a ire or batteryexplosion. Lithium batteriesdischarged toless thanone volt may\nbe managed asnon-hazardous waste in Minnesota, but mayremain subject to HMRtransport requirements.\nYou may accumulate different types of universal waste batteriestogether as long as you ensure they will not\nshort-circuit or cause a fire during accumulation. When you ship universal waste batteriesoff site, ensure you\ncomply with applicable HMR requirements to prevent short circuits during transport. You may need to enclose\neach batteryin anon-conducting bag or wrap, insulate terminals, or pack batteriesto prevent them from\ntouching each otheror conductive materials.\nLamps\nUniversal waste lamps include any hazardous waste bulb or tube portion of an electrical lighting device.\nuniversal waste lamps include, but are not limited to fluorescent, high intensity discharge (HID), mercuryvapor,\nlow and high pressure sodium (LPS and HPS), metal halide, and neon (includes lamps containing other noble\ngases such as argon, krypton, or xenon).\n'Greentip' fluorescent lamps\nCertain models of fluorescent lamps aredesigned to pass the hazardous wastetest for mercury, and are\ncommonly labeled as'low mercury' or by having green-colored metal end caps, known as'greentips'. These\nlamps do still contain mercury, and in Minnesota must still be recycled. 'Greentip' fluorescent lamps from\nbusinesses may not be disposed as solid waste.\nLEDs\nAlthough the bulb portions of most light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are not hazardous and thus not universal waste\nlamps, the attached circuit boards are regulated electronic wastes in Minnesota. See MPCA fact sheet\n#w-hw4-15, Managing Electronic Wastes, at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w-hw4-15.pdf.\nOn-site crushingorcracking\nIn Minnesota, you may not crush the hazardous portion of universal waste lamps on your site unless you can\ndemonstratethat no hazardous constituents (such as mercury) will be released to the environment from the\nentire crushing process, including filterchanges.The MPCAis notawareofanycommerciallyavailablelamp\ncrushing equipment that can currentlymeet this standard.\nThe MPCA discourages cracking the shell of a universal waste lamp to attempt to remove the hazardous portion\nof the lamp. The hazardous portion of many universal waste lamps is contained in an inner sealed arctube or\ncapsule. Heat and chemical reactions in the arc tube may cause the glass to become brittle. This createsa high\nrisk for da mage a nd mercury release if you attempt to extract the tube from the la mp.\nAccumulation\nIf you accumulate more than 1000 universal waste lamps that you did not generate yourself, you must establish\nfinancial assurance with the MPCA.

Waste Identification\nA company generates aerosol paint and solvent cans from\npainting and cleaning operations. The cans are empty as\nper common industry practices used to empty such devices\nto less than 3% by weight of the total capacity of the\ncontainer (40 CFR 261.7(b)(1(1) & (111)). The cans may\nstill contain propellant, making the cans reactive if\nput in contact with a strong initiating force (i.e.,\nintense pressure or heat). Since for all practicable\npurposes the cans are free of contents that might have\nbeen hazardous wastes, would this be regulation of the\naerosol cans themselves? RIL #43 specifically excluded\nthe regulation of the cans, and solely addressed only\nthe potentially hazardous contents. Therefore, would\naerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but still\npotentially reactive because of contained propellant be\nregulated as hazardous waste?\nIrrespective of the lack of contained waste, the\naerosol cans would be a RCRA hazardous waste\nbecause they demonstrate the hazardous\ncharacteristic of reactivity (40 CFR 261.23(a)(6)).\nSource: Mike Petruska (202) 475-6676\nResearch: Andy O'Hare\nRO 13027\n\nATTACHMENT 13\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOCTOBER 7, 1993\nMr. John DiFazio\nChemical Specialties Manufacturers Association\n1913 Eye Street, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20006\nDear Mr. DiFazio:\nOver the past several years we have received numerous questions from you and others\nconcerning the regulatory status of used aerosol cans under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. I understand that confusion about these issues may be\nhindering your cooperative efforts with the Steel Recycling Institute (SRI) to increase steel aerosol can\nrecycling in this country. As environmentally protective recycling is an important part of the Agency's\nwaste management goals, I hope that this letter will help to answer some of these questions.\nRESIDENTIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFirst, I would like to emphasize that under the federal RCRA regulations, household waste\n(including aerosol cans) is excluded from the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.4 (b) (1)).\nThus, any aerosol cans generated by households are not regulated as hazardous waste. Because this\nexclusion attaches at the point of generation (i.e., the household) and continues to apply throughout the\nwaste management cycle, household aerosol cans collected in municipal recycling programs and\nsubsequently managed in recycling programs continue to be excluded from the hazardous waste\nmanagement regulations.\nThe data submitted by SRI` appear to confirm that the majority of used residential aerosol cans\ncontain very little residual product or propellant. Along with your experience working with many of the\n600 or more communities currently recycling these cans, the data. suggest that aerosol cans can be\neffectively recycled.\nThe Agency does recommend that communities running residential steel recycling programs\neducate their participants to recycle only empty steel aerosol cans. Participants could also be educated\nto: 1) purchase only the amount of consumer products that they need to minimize the quantities of\nunused products, 2) give unused products to someone else who can use them, 3) take unused or\npartially full containers to a household hazardous waste collection program if available, or 4) dispose of\nthe partially full containers as directed on the label.\nCOMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFaxBack # 11780\n\nI understand that you and SRI are also interested in facilitating the recycling of aerosol cans\ngenerated by commercial or industrial generators. The remainder of this letter discusses only these non-\nhousehold waste items.\nWe have been asked whether aerosol cans e~chibit the characteristic of reactivity. At this time,\nthe Agency is not able to determine whether various types of cans that may have contained a wide range\nof products are reactive. However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount of\nliquid would clearly meet the definition of scrap metal (40 CFR 261.1 (c)(6)), and thus would be\nexempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iv) if it were to be recycled. Therefore, a\ndetermination of reactivity or any other characteristic would not be relevant. Aerosol cans that have\nbeen punctured so that most of any liquid remaining in the can may flow from the can (e.g., at either end\nof the can), and drained (e.g., with punctured end down), would not contain significant liquids.\nIt should be noted that since the process of emptying the aerosol cans is part of a recycling\nprocess (i.e., scrap steel recycling), this activity would be exempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (except as specified in 40 CFR 261.6(d)). The Agency recommends that these activities be\nconducted in a safe and environmentally protective manner and that care be taken to properly manage\nany contents removed from the container (both liquids and gases). Any liquids or corrtained gases\nremoved from aerosol cans may be subject to regulation as hazardous wastes if they are listed in\nSubpart D of 40 CFR Part 261 or if they e~ibit any characteristics of hazardous waste as described in\nSubpart C of 40 CFR Part 261.\nWe have also been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans would meet the definition of\n\"empty\" under 40 CFR 261.7. Again, if the steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to\ndetermine whether they are \"empty\" under the criteria listed in 40 CFR 261.7 As long as an aerosol can\nbeing recycled does not contain significant liquids, the can is exempt as scrap metal. However, in order\nto dispose of a can as nonhazardous waste (rather than recycle it), a generator would have to\ndetermine that the can is empty under 40 CFR 261.7 (or that the product it contained was not\nhazardous), and that the can itself is not hazardous. If a can is to be disposed of, and either contains or\nis hazardous waste, it must be managed under all applicable regulations.\nPlease be aware that this letter addresses only the federal hazardous waste regulations.\nAuthorized State agencies implement the RCRA program in their states (although some parts of the\nprogram may be implemented by the U.S. EPA Regions), and that state regulations may be more\nstringent than the federal regulations. Anyone managing aerosol cans should contact the appropriate\nstate environmental agency or U.S. EPA Regional Office to determine how the regulations of that\nparticular state will apply to their activities.\nI hope this information is useful in your efforts to increase steel recycling.

Crawford\nVice President, Recycling Operations\nSteel Recycling Institute\nFoster Plaza X\n680 Anderson Drive\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15220\nDear Mr. Crawford:\nOver the past several years we have received numerous\nquestions concerning the regulatory status of used aerosol cans\nunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous\nwaste regulations. I understand that confusion about these issues\nmaybe hindering your efforts to increase steel aerosol can\nrecycling in this country. As environmentally protective recycling\nis an important part of the Agency's waste management goals, I hope\nthat this letter will help to answer some of these questions.\nRESIDENTIAL AEROSOL CANS\nFirst, I would like to emphasize that under the federal RCRA\nregulations, household waste (including aerosol cans) is excluded\nfrom the definition of hazardous waste (40 CFR 261.4(b)(1)). Thus,\nany aerosol cans generated by households are not regulated as\nhazardous waste. Because this exclusion attaches at the point of\ngeneration (i.e., the household) and combines to apply throughout\nthe waste management cycle, household aerosol cans collected in\nmunicipal recycling programs and subsequently managed in recycling\nprograms continue to be excluded from the hazardous waste\nmanagement regulations.\nThe data you submitted (see footnote 1) appear to confirm that\nthe majority of used residential aerosol cans contain very little\nresidual product or propellant. Along with your experience working\nwith many of the 600 or more communities currently recycling these\nRO 11782\n\ncans, the data suggest that aerosol cans can be effectively\nrecycled. The Agency does recommend that communities running\nresidential steel recycling programs educate their participants to\nrecycle only empty steel aerosol cans. Participants could also be\neducated to: 1) purchase only the amount of consumer products that\nthey need to minimize the quantities of unused products, 2) give\nunused products to someone else who can use them, 3) take unused or\npartially full containers to a household hazardous waste collection\nprogram if available, or 4) dispose of the partially full\ncontainers as directed on the label.\nCOMMERCIAL/INDUSTRIAL AEROSOL CANS\nI understand that you are also interested in facilitating the\nrecycling of aerosol cans generated by commercial or industrial\ngenerators. The remainder of this letter discusses only these\nnon-household waste items.\nWe have been asked whether aerosol cans exhibit the\ncharacteristic of reactivity. At this time, the Agency is not able\nto determine whether various types of cans that may have contained\na wide range of products are reactive. However, a steel aerosol can\nthat does not contain a significant amount of liquid would clearly\nmeet the definition of scrap metal (40 CFR 261.1(c)(6)), and thus\nwould be exempt from RCRA regulation under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(iv)\nif it were to be recycled. Therefore, a determination of reactivity\nor any other characteristic would not be relevant. Aerosol cans\nthat have been punctured so that most of any liquid remaining in\nthe can may flow from the can (e.g., at either end of the can), and\ndrained (e.g., with punctules end down), would not contain\nsignificant liquids.\nIt should be noted that since the process of emptying the\naerosol cans is part of a recycling process (i.e., scrap steel\nrecycling), this activity would be exempt from RCRA regulation\nunder 40 CFR 261.6(c) (except as specified in 40 CFR 261.6(d)). The\nAgency recommends that these activities be conducted in a safe and\nenvironmentally protective manner and that care be taken to\nproperly manage any contents removed from the container (both\nliquids and gases). Any liquids or contained gases removed from\naerosol cans maybe subject to regulation as hazardous wastes if\nthey are listed in Subpart D of 40 CFR Part 261 or if they exhibit\nany characteristics of hazardous waste as described in Subpart C of\nRO 11782\n\n40 CFR Part 261.\nWe have also been asked to determine whether used aerosol cans\nwould meet the definition of \"empty\" under 40 CFR 261.7. Again, if\nthe steel cans are being recycled, it is not necessary to determine\nwhether they are \"empty\" under the criteria listed in 40 CFR 261.7.\nAs long as an aerosol can being recycled does not contain\nsignificant liquids, the can is exempt as scrap metal. However, in\norder to dispose of a can as non-hazardous waste (rather than\nrecycle it), a generator would have to determine that the can is\nempty under 40 CFR 261.7 (or that the product it contained was not\nhazardous), and that the can itself is not hazardous. If a can is\nto be disposed of, and either contains or is hazardous waste, it\nmust be managed under all applicable regulations.\nPlease be aware that this letter addresses only the federal\nhazardous waste regulations. Authorized State agencies implement\nthe RCRA program in their states (although some parts of the\nprogram maybe implemented by the U.S. EPA Regions), and that state\nregulations maybe more stringent than the federal regulations.\nAnyone managing aerosol cans should contact the appropriate state\nenvironmental agency or U.S. EPA Regional Office to determine how\nthe regulations of that particular state will apply to their\nactivities.\nI hope this information is useful in your efforts to increase\nsteel recycling. Thank you for the assistance that you and the\nSteel Recycling Institute have provided my staff in researching\nthese issues.

Laws, Assistant Administrator\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nTO: Regional Administrators\nOn May 11, EPA promulgated a final rule which promotes the environmentally sound collection\nof several hazardous waste categories for recycling or proper disposal under the Resource\nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This rule, known as the Universal Waste Rule (40 CFR Part\n273), creates a framework for streamlined regulatory requirements for hazardous waste batteries,\ncertain pesticides and mercury -containing thermostats (universal wastes). The Universal Waste rule is\ndesigned to achieve the following three goals: 1) encouraging resource conservation while ensuring\nadequate protection of human health and the environment, 2) improving implementation of the current\nSubtitle C hazardous waste regulatory program, and 3) removing these universal wastes from the\nmunicipal waste stream by providing incentives for individuals and organizations to collect currently\nunregulated wastes and then ensuring that treatment of those wastes meets the hazardous waste\nmanagement standards. To achieve these goals, environmentally sound collection systems must be\ndeveloped for universal wastes. As such, another goal is to foster the development of an appropriate\ncollection infrastructure in all of the States as quickly as possible.\nThe Agency encourages the timely development of the types collection systems allowed by this\nnew regulation. EPA recognizes that both States and private industry may delay the implementation of\nuniversal waste collection programs until States adopt and become authorized for this rule. To facilitate\nthe speedy implementation of the Universal Waste rule, EPA is encouraging States to quickly adopt the\nrule. Because most States are already authorized for the base RCR.A program, authorization for the\nUniversal Waste rule should be swift and uncomplicated. Therefore, Regions should make authorization\nof States for this rule a high priority in Regional State Authorization Programs and should process\nStates' authorization applications as quickly as possible.\nBy finalizing 40 C.F.R. Part 273, EPA has taken the position that managing wastes in\nFaxBack # 11960\n\ncompliance with those standards is environmentally protective. Therefore, where States are\nimplementing the Part 273 standards but have not yet received authorizarion, Regions should\ntalce enforcement actions involving universal wastes only where handlers of such wastes are not in full\ncompliance with the Part 273 standards. Regions should continue to address universal waste\nmanagement practices that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and\nthe environment under the authority provided in section 7003 of RCRA.\nIf you or your staff have any technical questions or concerns regarding the Universal Waste Rule\nor the policies contained in this memorandum, please contact Krishna Meson at (202) 260-5736 or\nBryan Groce at (202) 260-9550 of the Office of Solid Waste.\n\nATTACHMENT 16\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nFEB 13 1997\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT : Universal Waste Questions and Answers Document\nFROM: Mike Shapiro\nOffice of Solid Waste\nTO: Senior RCRA Policy Managers\nRegions I-X\nSince the promulgation of the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule (60 FR 25492),\nseveral States have begun to adopt the Federal program. As a result, many questions have been\nraised with respect to State implementation and enforcement for hazardous wastes covered\nunder the Universal Waste Federal program. Further, States have asked the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) Regional Offices for guidance on adding other types of hazardous\nwaste to their State universal waste programs. To assist those States during their\nimplementation process and to provide you with the Agency's position on these issues, the\nOffice of Solid Waste has prepared a Questions and Answers (Q&A) document. The Q&A\ndocument also addresses other issues related to universal waste management (e.g., universal\nwaste generation and transportation issues). I have attached the document for your information\nand encourage you to share it with the appropriate State Officials.\nIf you have any questions regarding State authorization, please contact Wayne Roepe\nat (703) 308-8630. If you have other questions regarding universal waste management, please\ncontact Bryan Groce of my staff at (703) 308-8750.\nAttachment\ncc: RCRA Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nState Authorization Section Chiefs, Regions I-X\nRCRA Community Relations Coordinators, Regions I-X\nRCRA Enforcement Branch Chiefs, Regions I-X\nFaxback# 14088\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - -UNIVERSAL WASTES (UW)\n1. Can a state include additional wastes in its UW program at the same time that it establishes\nthe program and then submit both the program and the additional UW to EPA for\nauthorization review at the same time? For example, can a state adopt a UW rule that\nregulates fluorescent bulbs and antifreeze as UW?\nYes, a state can designate additional waste streams as UW at the same time that it creates its\nown UW rule. However, it must find that the wastes meet its criteria for inclusion in the UW\nprogram, and its criteria must be analogous to the federal criteria set out in 273.81. See\npreamble to final UW rule at 60 FR 25512, 25537. The state need not submit the new wastes\nto EPA for authorization. EPA will review and authorize the state's UW program (including\nthe criteria for adding wastes to the program) and the 3 waste streams included in the federal\nprogram. EPA will not conduct any authorization review on any additional, state-only UW.\nEPA, however, requests that states send copies of tentative decisions to include new\nwastes (and proposed management standards for such wastes) to the appropriate FPA\nRegional Office to give EPA an opportunity to comment. See the response to question 5 for\nmore detail on this process.\n2. Can a state itself petition the Agency to add wastes to the federal UW rules - or does the\npetition have to come from a private party?\nA state itself can petition.\n3. a. How will the petition process work at the state level? Will it require public participation\nand rulemaking to add a UW to an authorized state program?\nEPA is requiring states to adopt petition procedures equivalent to the federal petition\nprocedures. This requires states to provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on\nany tentative decision to grant or deny a petition to include new universal wastes. See the\npreamble at 60 FR 25537. EPA also assumes that the state will need to follow its normal\nrulemaking procedures to create any new management standards needed for the new UW.\nb. How will EPA adopt a UW -using the Federal Register and public comment process?\nYes. As required by 40 CFR 260.20 (c), if EPA receives a UW petition, it will publish a\nnotice of tentative decision and announce a comment period in the Federal Re  ~ister. After\nconsidering all comments, EPA will publish notice of its final decision in the Federal Re eci.\nThe same process applies to both decisions to grant and to decisions to deny petitions.\n4. a. Can a state add wastes that are state-only hazardous wastes?\nYes. State hazardous waste programs can be more stringent and broader in scope than federal\nprograms. Consequently, states may regulate as \"state-only\" hazardous wastes materials that\n\nare only solid wastes under the federal program. States may streamline their regulation of\nthese \"state-only\" hazardous wastes by including them in their UW programs.\nb. Can a state add wastes that are non-hazardous?\nYes. A state could add non-hazardous solid wastes to its UW program by designating such\nwastes as state-only hazardous wastes and then designating them as UW wastes. Such wastes\nwould be subject to the state's ordinary hazardous waste requirements for treatment and\ndisposal. EPA assumes that states would want this result, because they probably would\ndesignate nonhazardous wastes as universal wastes to divert them from the nonhazardous\nwaste disposal facilities that curently handle them. If, however, a state determined that some\naspects of its hazardous waste management regime should not apply to these state-only\nhazardous wastes, it could create exemptions. (Exemptions would be permissible since the\nwastes would not be regulated as hazardous wastes under the federal program.)\nOne exception applies. A state may not designate as a UW any waste that is hazardous\nunder the federal program due to a rule promulgated under HSWA authority for which the\nstate is not authorized. (For example, a state that was not authorized for the Toxicity\nCharacteristic could not designate a waste that exhibited the TC as a universal waste. See the\npreamble to the final rule at 25537.)\n5. After a state has adopted and is authorized for the UWR -does the state have ultimate\ndecision-making authority to add wastes or does EPA still have involvement? And what is\nEPA's role during the petition process, post authorization?\nStates authorized for the UW rule will not be required to submit program revisions for any\naddition of wastes to their UW program. EPA requests that states send a copy of their tentative\nfindings and any draft regulations for managing the new, state-only universal wastes to the\nappropriate EPA Regional Office. This will provide EPA with an opportunity to comment on\nthe state's proposed action. EPA encourages states to coordinate EPA's review and comment\nwith the opportunity to comment that the state must provide for the public. If EPA finds that a\nstate has added wastes that do not qualify, or that the management standards are not\nsufficiently protective, and that, as a result, the state's program is less stringent than the federal\nprogram, EPA has authority to withdraw authorization of the state's hazardous waste program\nas provided in Part 271.\nEPA will not conduct any authorization review of the new state-only UW and new\nmanagement standards. EPA takes the position that, when it authorizes a state to add wastes\nto the UW category, it authorizes in advance the state's new, state-only universal wastes and\nthe management standards for such wastes. All changes to state regulations needed to\nimplement a UW program for the new UW automatically become part of the authorized state\nprogram once they take effect under state law.\n6a. When will the EPA rule on fluorescent lights be final (designation as a Federal UW vs.\nmanagement as solid waste)?\nEPA has not yet decided when it will promulgate a final rule regarding regulation of\nfluorescent lamps as discussed in the July 1994 proposal.\n\nb. What happens if a state adds fluorescent lamps to its UWR and then EPA decides to come\nout with a conditional exemption for fluorescent lamps?\nIf the conditional exemption is less stringent than the state UW rule, the state would have the\noptio n of adopting the exemption, but would not be required to do so.\n7.a. Where do LDR recordkeeping requirements fit in --- only at the final destination facility?\nYes.\nb. Is the destination facility responsible (liable) for identifying the treatment\nstandards/technologies and filling out certification forms?\nYes. The destination facility is the first entity that handles a UW that is responsible for\ncompliance with any of the LDR requirements, including recordkeeping. For UW handlers\nthat are not subject to the LDR rules, the prohibitions on dilution under the UW program\nprovide the same protection as the dilution prohibition under the LDR program. (See. e.g., 40\nCFR 273.11.)\n8.a. Are all batteries included in the Federal UWR, or just those considered hazardous?\nEPA's federal UW program does not apply to all batteries. The exceptions are listed in 40\nCFR 273.2(b). Generally, the battery must first be a waste. (Note that unused batteries are\nnot always wastes -- someone must first make a decision to discard them (i.e., treat, recycle, or\ndispose of the unused batteries)). Next, the battery must be classified as a hazardous waste\nunder either a hazardous waste listing or a characteristic test and must not be generated by a\nhousehold. One category of batteries which are both wastes and hazardous wastes is\nnevertheless exempt from the UW regulations in Part 273: spent lead-acid batteries managed\nunder 40 CFR Part 266. Finally, the recently enacted \"Mercur}~Containing and Rechargeable\nBattery Management Act\" changes states' options for regulating some batteries which are\nhazardous waste under RCRA. Specifically, the law prohibits states from imposing\nrequirements that are not identical to those found in the May 11, 1995 Universal Waste rule\nfor the following types of hazardous waste batteries: used rechargeable batteries, lead-acid\nbatteries not covered by 40 CFR part 266 subpart G, rechargeable alkaline products, certain\nmercury-containing batteries banned from domestic sale, and used consumer products\ncontaining rechargeable batteries that are not easily removable. The law does allow states to\nimplement and enforce collection, storage, and transport requirements identical to those\nincluded in the Universal Waste rule.\nb. Do lead acid batteries fall under the UWR or do they stay under the lead-acid battery\nexemption?\nUnder the federal program, lead acid batteries are managed under Part 266, subpart G rather\nthan the UW program. EPA chose to retain the Part 266 standards for these batteries to avoid\ndisrupting the existing recycling program for such batteries because they provide for\n\nprotection of human health and the environment and because they have been highly successful\n(with recycling rates in excess of 90 percent). States, however, retain the authority to regulate\nlead-acid batteries more stringently. Hence, they may choose to regulate lead acid batteries\nunder their UW programs.\n9. A handler who transports UW is considered a UW transporter. Is this for any quantity of\nUW (i.e., in the used oil regulations a used oil generator can transport up to 55 gallons of their\nown used oil without being considered a used oil transporter)?\nYes, all handlers who transport any quantity of UW must meet the UW transporter\nrequirements. There is no de minimis exemption like the one in the used oil program.\n10. Would a program consisting of astate-sponsored network of handler locations at private\nbusinesses be considered a \"waste pesticide collection program\"?\nYes. Part 273 does not require states to operate the waste pesticide collection programs\ndescribed in 40 CFR 273.3(a)(2) in order for the pesticides managed under such programs to\nbe eligible for the UW program.\n11. As the UWR is implemented, do the traditional liability issues change? For example, who\nis liable for any mismanagement of a UW at a handler location, in transit, and at the\ndestination facility? Are any and all handlers liable for mismanagement at a destination\nfacility or at subsequent handlers? Or, just the \"final handler\" that chooses the destination\nfacility? Do we lose cradle-to-grave responsibility with UWR?\nUnder the full Subtitle C program, only the waste handler that violates a hazardous waste\nregulation is \"liable\" (i.e., subject to enforcement) for that violation. Generators of hazardous\nwaste are not responsible for mismanagement by subsequent waste handlers. The UW rule\ndoes not change this allocation of responsibility.\nGenerators are responsible for subsequent mismanagement under CERCLA, however.\nThe UW rule does not change CERCLA liability. Since UW are still hazardous wastes,\npersons who generate UW remain liable under CERCLA for remediation of any releases of\nUW.\n12. When UW is shipped to a destination facility, does it have to be relabeled as HW at that\nfacility, or will UW labeling be sufficient?\nUniversal wastes remain hazardous wastes. Destination facilities must comply with all\ncurrently applicable requirements for hazardous waste management facilities. However, none\nof these regulations require facility owners or operators to relabel the containers holding\nuniversal wastes.\n13a. Handlers can keep UW on site up to one year after the date it is received or generated. A\nyear after a handler has received a UW, can the UW go to another handler, or must it go to\ndestination facility?\n\nUniversal waste can only be sent off-site to another universal waste handler, destination\nfacility, or foreign destination. Theoretically, each receiving facility could accumulate the\nwaste for an entire year before sending it off to another handler, however, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\nb. Within that year, can the UW go to several handlers?\nYes, but states can adopt a more stringent rule that would prevent this. Also, although\ntheoretically wastes could go from one collection facility to another forever, the regulatory\nimpact analysis EPA prepared for the UW rulemaking indicates that there is no economic\nincentive for retaining UW for such long periods.\n14. Pesticides that are included in FIFRA recalls can be managed under the UWR. Does this\napply to pesticides that have been included in past FIFRA recalls or just recalls instituted after\nthe UWR is adopted?\nThe timing of the recall is not significant. The UW rule is not limited to pesticides that are\nrecalled after the UW rule takes effect.\n15. Pesticides that are managed by farmers in accordance with 40 CFR 262.70 are not subject\nto the UW rules. Can farmers continue to dispose of pesticides recalled under FIFRA under\n262.70?\nYes, if a recall under FIFRA allows a farmer to dispose of a pesticide on his own property, he\nmay do so by complying with 262.70.\n16. How are mixtures of UW and HW regulated -- as a HW if the HW is listed or the mixture\ne~ibits a characteristic? If the HW is not listed, and the mixture of UW and HW does not\nexhibit a characteristic, does LDR apply to the mixture?\nThe UW rules apply only to wastes meeting the criteria for being classified as UW. They do\nnot apply to mixtures of UW wastes and ordinary, \"norruniversal\" hazardous wastes. Such\nmixtures are subject to the regular hazardous waste regulations.\nHowever, the status of mixtures of characteristic UW and characteristic hazardous\nwastes needs clarification. If the mixture no longer eachibits a characteristic, it would no\nlonger be classified as a hazardous waste, but would remain subject to the land disposal\nrestrictions. Formerly characteristic wastes are not excused from compliance with LDR\ntreatment standards merely because they cease to exhibit a characteristic.\nIn addition, two exceptions apply. First, mixtures of UW and conditionally exempt\nsmall quantity generator (CESQG) hazardous wastes are subject to UW rules. This is because\nCESQG hazardous wastes are exempt from regular Subtitle C regulation. See the UW\npreamble at 25510. By the same logic, mixtures of UW wastes and hazardous wastes\nexempted under the household hazardous waste provision are subject to the UW provisions\nrather than the regular hazardous waste provisions.\n\nThe normal hazardous waste mixture rules would apply to mixtures of UW and\nnonhazardous solid wastes. If the UW waste were a listed waste, the mixture would be\nregulated as HW (although initial handlers would be subject only to the UW rules). If the UW\nwere a characteristic waste, and the mixture ceased to exhibit the characteristic, the mixture\nwould be nonhazardous but LDR treatment requirements would continue to apply.\n17. A large quantity universal waste handler (LQHLJW) is required to notify EPA of its\nuniversal waste management, unless it had already so notified and received an EPA ID\nnumber. However, won't the LQHUW have to modify the initial notification to explain this\nadditional activity?\nNo. If a handler has previously notified EPA of his hazardous waste management activities,\nhe is not required to renotify. First time notifiers can submit aone-time notification described\nin 40 CFR 273.32(b), or alternatively, the 8700-12 notification form. If the 8700-12\nnotification form is used, the LQHUW must write \"LQHIJW\" or \"Universal Waste\" on the\nportion of the form where activity is checked.\n18. Does the UWR prohibit a generator from handling a UW in accordance with full RCRA C\nrequirements, if desired?\nThe UWR requires a generator to handle their UW under 273. However, if the generator\nhandles UW under full RCRA C then it would likely be complying with 273.\n19. If a generator originates a shipment of hazardous waste that is considered a UW in the\nreceiving state, how does the generator get a signed manifest?\nThe initiating facility (i.e., the generator) would complete a manifest and give copies to the\nhazardous waste transporter as required under 40 CFR 262.23(a). The initiating facility must\nensure that the manifest is forwarded to and signed by the UW receiving facility (i.e., the\ndesignated TSD facility) and then sent back to the initiating facility.\n20. a. Because a manifest is now not required, how will handlers know how and when their\nUW finally arrives at an appropriate destination facility?\nDepending on whether the UW are shipped to another UW handler or a UW destination\nfacility, the initiating facility (i.e., the generator) may not know if their UW arrives at an\nappropriate destination facility. For example, if the universal waste is shipped to another\nuniversal waste handler (i.e., an interim facility) before it is shipped to a designated facility,\nthe originating facility would only have knowledge of the initial receiving facility. (See\nresponse to question 11). However, if the originating facility (i.e., the generator) sent the\nuniversal waste to a destination facility, Part 273 requires the originating facility to receive\nprior consent by a receiving facility (i.e., the destination facility) before the waste can be sent\noff-site.\n\nb. Does EPA intend for the original handler to \"designate\" all the handlers and final\ndestination facility?\nNo. The original handler (i.e., the initiating facility) is only responsible for designating the\nnext UW handler (though the original handler is free to elect to designate the final destination\nfacility)\n21. What happens when UWR is adopted by a state but is not yet authorized by EPA? What\nis EPA obligated to enforce?\nEPA may only enforce the authorized state program. The authorized program would continue\nto impose regular hazardous waste management standards on UW handlers until EPA\napproved the state's UW rule. Note, however, that once the rule is approved, designations of\nnew, state-only UW and management standards for such wastes become part of the authorized\nprogram without action by EPA. See the response to question 5 above.\nThe Agency has also issued a memorandum (See the April 10, 1996 Memorandum\naddressed to the Regional Administrators from Steven A. Herman, Assistant Administrator of\nthe Office of Enforcement and Compliance and Elliot P. Laws, Assistant Administrator of the\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response) which asks the EPA Regional offices to\nexercise enforcement discretion (vis a vis unmanifested universal wastes) in States that are\nauthorized for the RCRA base program and that are implementing the Part 273 standards but\nhave not yet received final EPA authorization to do so. The memorandum further provides\nthat the Regions should take enforcement actions involving universal waste only where\nhandlers of such wastes are not in full compliance with the Part 273 standards. In other words,\nthe Agency will not take federal action against handlers who manage hazardous waste\nbatteries, hazardous waste pesticides, and mercurycontaining thermostats pursuant to Part 273\nstandards in States that are currently in the process of adopting the universal waste rule.\nStates, of course, may still pursue enforcement action against these handlers. The Agency\nhopes that the April 10, 1996 letter will facilitate implementation of the universal waste rule\nby states nationwide.\n22. How are recycling facilities that receive UW regulated?\nRecycling facilities are excluded from the definition of UW \"handlers\". See 40 CFR 273.6.\nThey are subject to normal hazardous waste management requirements. Under those\nrequirements, storage prior to recycling is regulated and requires a permit. See 40 CFR\n261.6(c) (1). Many types of recycling processes are largely exempt from regulation (see 40\nCFR 261.6(d)); others (such as burning to recover energy or materials) are regulated and\nrequire permits.\n\nATTACHMENT 17\n\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOFFICE OF\nSOLID WASTE AND\nEMERGENCY\nRichard J. Barlow, Chair\nNortheast Waste Management Officials' Association (NEWMOA)\n129 Portland Street, Suite 601\nBoston, MA 02114-2014\nDear Mr. Barlow:RESPONSE\nI am pleased to respond to your May 23,1996 letter, in which you support the\nState of New York Department of Environmental Conservation rulemaking petition\nregarding 40 CFR Part 263 relative to the transportation of hazardous waste. I also\nunderstand that you have serious concerns about the recent preemption determination\nby the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) which was published on December 6,\n1995. (See 60 FR 62527). Specifically, you desire more regulatory oversight than is\ncurrently provided by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)\nregulations for hazardous waste activities at transfer facilities.\nAs you know, the recent DOT preemption decision cited in your letter arose from\na challenge lodged by the transporter industry against certain New York State\nregulations pertaining to activities at hazardous waste transfer facilities. Briefly, the\nState had enacted regulations which, among other things, prohibited certain load\nmixing activities at transfer facilities, and imposed secondary containment requirements\nin areas of these facilities reserved for off-vehicle storage. There is no federal\ncounterpart to these state regulations in EPA's Part 263 regulations, and DOT's\nregulations do not impose similar restrictions. In the decision published in the Federal\nRegister of December 6,1995, DOT held that each of the challenged State regulations\nwas preempted, because each was inconsistent with the uniform scheme of federal\nregulation which Congress intended for the control of interstate transportation of\nhazardous materials.\nWe are well aware of the long-standing interest of the States in the issues\nsurrounding the regulation of hazardous waste transfer facilities. I also understand that\nunless and until there are revisions to the federal regulations governing transfer\nfacilities, States which act alone to fill the perceived gaps in the federal RCRA\ntransporter regulations (40 CFR Part 263) are likely to face similar challenges under the\nstrong preemption authorities included by Congress in the 1990 amendments to the\nHazardous Materials Transportation act (HMTA).\nRO 14135\n\nWhile I understand the resource issues that States are facing when they are\nforced to defend the validity of their laws before DOT or the courts, I note that this\npredicament arises primarily from the manner in which the Congress has allocated\nresponsibility among the federal agencies and the States in the transportation area. The\nCongress has spoken in fairly unequivocal terms in RCRA 3003(b) that RCRA\nrequirements addressing transporters must be consistent with the HMTA and\nregulations issued thereunder. The HMTA in turn provides DOT with considerable\nauthority to preempt inconsistent State laws, particularly in certain of the so-called\n\"covered areas\" of hazardous materials regulation affected by New York's contested\nrequirements, or, in those instances where inconsistent State laws would pose an\nobstacle to accomplishing or cat-tying out the HMTA's scheme of regulation. See 49\nU.S.C. '5125. These types of strong preemption authorities are quite foreign to RCRA,\nbut they are introduced into the transporter area by the statutory directive in RCRA to\nmaintain consistency with the DOT framework.\nOn March 1,1996, the Office of Solid Waste (OSW) stated to Commissioner\nZagata of New York that OSW could not at this time commit our scarce federal\nrulemaking resources to the transfer facility problem without diverting resources from\nwhat I believe to be greater priorities for the RCRA program as a whole. This is still true\ntoday. However, at such time as our resources and priorities permit, we will revisit the\nmerits of committing resources to resolving the transfer facility concerns. I do, however,\nappreciate NEWMOA's interest in supporting such a rulemaking.\nI would like to be able to respond more positively to your letter at this time, but I\nknow that our state partners understand that in these times, we must allocate our\nresources and energies judiciously. Thank you for bringing these concerns and\nsuggestions to my attention. We appreciate the efforts of NEWMOA and its state\nmembers for their strong support for improving the RCRA program\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 14135\n\nATTACHMENT Z S\n\n9461.1994(02)\nSTORAGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE AT TRANSFER FACILITIES AND THE\nAUTHORIZATION OF STATES REGULATING THIS STORAGE\nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\nWASHINGTON, D.C. 20460\nOffice of Solid Waste and Emergency Response\nAugust 17, 1994\nCharles Dickhut\nChemical Waste Transportation Institute\n4301 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nSuite 300\nWashington, D.C. 20008\nDear Mr. Dickhut,\nThank you for your letter of June 3,1994, in which you\nrequest that EPA clarify and reaffirm its interpretations and\npolicies regarding the storage of hazardous waste at transfer\nfacilities, the authorization of states for provisions regulating\nthis storage, and the preemption of such provisions by the\nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) under the Hazardous Materials\nTransportation Act (HMTA).\nIn your letter you request that EPA reaffirm specific\nprevious interpretations of the 10-day storage limitation for\ntransfer facilities. RCRA regulations at 40 CFR 263.12 state that\n\"a transporter who stores manifested shipments of hazardous waste\nin containers meeting the requirements of 262.30 at a transfer\nfacility for a period of ten days or less is not subject to\nregulation under Parts 270, 264, 265, and 268 of this chapter with\nrespect to the storage of those wastes.\" These regulations do not\nrestrict the use of multiple transfer facilities for one shipment\nnor do they place further restrictions on the number of days\navailable at each facility (i.e., they do not limit the total\nnumber of days spent at all transfer facilities to 10). Of course,\neach transfer facility must meet the definition found at 260.10.\nA key element of the 260.10 definition is the \"normal course\nof transportation.\" Storage of manifested shipments of hazardous\nwaste at a transfer facility must be within the normal course of\nRO 13692\n\ntransportation. As the Agency has stated in the past, EPA can\nenvision situations in which hazardous waste maybe stored atone\ntransfer facility for 10 days, and then be stored at a second\ntransfer facility for. an additiona110 days, and remain within the\nnormal course of transportation (see the attached June 7,1990\nletter from Sylvia Lawrence to Robert Duprey and the June 22,1994,\nletter from Michael Petruska to Kevin Igli).\nYour letter also asked for clarification of the phrase \"normal\ncourse of transportation.\" The 10-day storage limitation at\ntransfer facilities was based on information provided by the\ntransportation industry, which indicated that shipments of\nhazardous waste normally take no longer than 15 days, including\nboth the actual transportation and the temporary holding of the\nshipment (see 45 FR 86966, December 31,1980). Individual\ncircumstances, however, may prevent shipments from being completed\nwithin this time period. EPA believes that what constitutes \"the\nnormal course of transportation\" depends on the particular facts of\neach case. Therefore, EPA does not believe it is appropriate to\nset a generic time limit beyond which a shipment would\nautomatically be outside the normal course of transportation.\nYou next inquire whether the authorization of a provision\naffecting the storage of hazardous wastes at transfer facilities\nunder 3006 of RCRA would make that provision no longer subject to\npreemption under the HMTA because it was \"otherwise authorized by\nFederal law.\" (See 49 App. U.S.C. 1811(a).) EPA formulated its\ncurrent position on RCRA state authorization and preemption under\nthe HMTA during the 1992 authorization of California for the base\nRCRA program. EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to use\nthe RCRA Subtitle C authorization process to make specific\ndeterminations of possible preemption under the HMTA. Pursuant to\nthe HMTA, the DOT has established procedures both for making\npreemption determinations and providing waivers from preemption.\nA possible issue of preemption under HMTA would not affect the\nprogram's eligibility for RCRA authorization where the preemption\nconcern is unrelated to RCRA authorities. (See 57 FR 32726, July\n23,1992, and the attached October 29, 1992, letter from Devereaux\nBarnes to Cynthia Hilton). Thus, EPA still believes that the RCRA\nauthorization decisions provide no basis for shielding state\nregulations touching upon hazardous materials transport from\npossible preemption challenges raised under the HMTA.\nFinally, you ask whether EPA has the authority to review a\nRO 13692\n\nstate's interpretation of an authorized provision. You cite the\nArkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology's (DPC&E)\ninterpretation of the 10-day transfer facility storage limitation\nas a cause for concern. According to your letter, the DPC&E\nenforces a 10-day storage limitation that applies to the total\nstorage time at all transfer facilities, not the storage time at\neach one. Although EPA has a different interpretation than what\nyou have described for the DPC&E, the state of Arkansas is\nauthorized for the transporter requirements, and thus has primary\nauthority for implementing them. EPA's response to a state's\ninterpretation of an authorized provision would depend on how it\nwas implemented in a particular situation, and factors such as any\nrelevant state court decisions or an enforcement action. EPA is\ncurrently not aware of any instance where this differing\ninterpretation has been implemented. Further, EPA believes that\nthe question of whether Arkansas' interpretation deviates from\nnational HMTA transportation standards should be addressed under\nthe HMTA preemption process, rather than through RCRA state\nauthorization.\nI hope that this clarification is of assistance to you.\nFurther guidance regarding the issues you have raised maybe\navailable in the future, as a result of EPA discussions with DOT.\nIf you have further questions regarding the authorization of states\nfor the regulation of hazardous waste transporters and transfer\nfacilities, please contact Wayne Roepe of my staff at 703-308-8630.\nIf you have further questions regarding the EPA regulations\nregarding the transportation of hazardous waste, please contact Ann\nCodrington of my staff at 202-260-4777.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nRO 13692\n\nATTACHMENT 19\n\n9541.1985(07)\nRCRA/SUPERFUND HOTLINE MONTHLY SUMMARY\nMAY 85\nManifest Use and State Authorization\n3. A spent solvent, which is hazardous by characteristic only (e.g.\nignitable D001), is transported from the generator in Montana, to a\nreclamation facility in Texas. Both Montana and Texas are states with\nfinal authorization for the RCRA program. The transporter will also go\nthrough Wyoming which is anon-authorized state (i.e., it is under the\nFederal RCRA program).\nPursuant to 40 CFR ~261.6(a), characteristic hazardous wastes which are\nreclaimed are not subject to RCRA regulations. According to ~261.2(c)\nas amended by the January 4,1985, Federal Register (50 FR 614), however,\nall spent solvents, characteristic or listed, will be defined as \"spent\nmaterials\" and will be regulated as \"solid wastes\" prior to reclamation.\nThus, per ~261.6(b), in the January 4,1985, rule, generators and\ntransporters of recyclable hazardous materials (e.g., spent solvents) are\nsubject to Parts 262 and 263 (generator and transporter standards,\nrespectively). The complicating factor is that this new definition of\nsolid waste and respective recycling regulations may go into effect at\ndifferent times through the country depending on whether a state is\nauthorized or not.\nThe January 4, 1985, rule will be effective in non-authorized states on\nJuly 5,1985. States with final authorization, such as Montana and\nTexas, may have up to January 4,1987, to adopt this rule. Therefore,\na characteristic ignitable spent solvent will be a regulated hazardous\nwaste prior to reclamation in non-authorized states on July 5,1985. In\nthe transport situation described above, is the transporter required to\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest in Wyoming, since the spent\nsolvent is a \"hazardous waste\" in Wyoming on July 5,1985?\nIf the spent solvent is transported from Montana to Texas (EPA-\nauthorized states) after July 5,1985, the transporter need not\ncarry the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest, even though the spent\nsolvent is transported through Wyoming, which regulates the\nsolvent as a RCRA waste. States through which the waste shipment\ntravels may not dictate manifest requirements per 49 FR 1049\nRO 12399\n\n(March 20, 1984). When either the generator state (Montana) or\nthe designated state (Texas) determines that the waste is\nhazardous, that waste will be subject to the Uniform Manifest\nrequirements.\nSource: Denise Hawkins (202) 382-2231\nRO 12399\n\nATTACHMENT ZO\n\nRegulatory Impact Assessment of the Potential Costs,\nBenefits, and Other Impacts of the Final Hazardous Waste\nGenerator Improvements Rule\nPrepared for\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nOffice of Resource Conservation and Recovery (ORCR)\n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW (Mailstop 5305P)\nWashington DC, 20460 USA\nSeptember 2016\n\n2.3 HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED FACILITIES\nThis section characterizes the hazardous waste generation of facilities in the regulated universe. The\noverall tonnages of hazardous waste and the number of waste streams are relevant to estimating the cost\nof managing this waste in compliance with the provisions of the final rule. The methodology for\nestimating the quantities of hazardous waste generation varies by generator status. Where possible, this\nRIA relies on generation data from EPA's 2013 BR database. The BR database is used to develop annual\naggregate and per facility generation estimates for LQG facilities. For other facility types, however, the\ndata available from the BR database are insufficient to develop nationwide hazardous waste generation\nestimates. Consequently, this RIA derives generation estimates for SQGs and VSQGs by combining the\nlimited data available in the BR database with facility-level generation data obtained from individual\nstates.\n2.3.1 LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION\nEPA's 2013 BR database is the primary data source for estimating hazardous waste generation for LQG\nfacilities. In 2013, LQGs generated approximately 35.2 million tons of hazardous waste in aggregate.\nCombining this value with the LQG facility count presented above suggests that LQGs, on average,\ngenerate approximately 1,692 tons of hazardous waste per facility per year.14 The BR data also suggest\nthat LQGs reported an average of 13 different waste streams per facility, with a few large facilities\nreporting several thousand waste streams. The SO largest LQGs generated 29.2 million tons of hazardous\nwaste, or 83 percent of the total amount reported in the 2013 BR.\nExhibit 2-5 reports the overall and average per facility hazardous waste quantities generated on an annual\nbasis as well as the average number of waste streams per facility for LQGs by state. As shown in the\nexhibit, the Gulf States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi account for approximately 63 percent of all\nhazardous waste generated by LQGs in the United States. In contrast, New York and California, which\nhave the largest number of LQG facilities, collectively account for just 5 percent of all hazardous waste\ngenerated by LQGs.\nExhibit 2-6 provides information on the distribution of LQGs by industry. Facilities in the BR database\nmay be characterized by one or several North American Industry Classification System (NAILS) codes.\nTo avoid double-counting, this RIA uses the first (or primary) NAILS code listed in the BR database for a\nfacility. As shown in the exhibit, the five largest industries (in terms of hazardous waste generation)\naccount for approximately 95 percent of all hazardous waste generated by LQGs, while comprising less\nthan 20 percent of all LQGs. These industries include: chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); petroleum\nand coal products manufacturing (NAILS 324); waste management and remediation services (NAILS\n562); primary metal manufacturing (NAILS 331); and mining (NAILS 212). In terms of the number of\ngenerators, the largest industries \u2014accounting for approximately 50 percent of the LQG universe \u2014\ninclude: health and personal care stores (NAILS 446); chemical manufacturing (NAILS 325); utilities\n(NAILS 221); fabricated metal product manufacturing (NAILS 332); and general merchandise stores\n(NAILS 452).\n~~ This average (mean) value includes a small number of facilities that generate more than one mill(on tons of hazardous waste per year. Thus,\nwhereas the mean generation value per LQG is 1,692 tons per year, the median (50'~ percentile) is only 7.6 tons per year. Because the cost and\nbenefit calculations in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively, do not use LQG waste generation as an Input (incremental costs and benefits for LQGs\nunder the rule are not dependent on waste quantities), the choice of using the mean or median has no impact on the estimated costs and benefits\nof the rule.\n2-9\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nSTATE\nANUMBER OF\nFACILITIES\nIN BR DATA\nBTOTAL HAZARDOUS\nWASTE GENERATED\n(TONS)\nCPERCENTAGE OF\nTOTAL\nHAZARDOUS\nWASTE\n[D]HAZARDOUS WASTE\nGENERATED PER\nFACILITY\n(TONS)\nE=C/BAVERAGE\nNUMBER OF\nWASTE STREAMS\nPER FACILITY\n[F]\nAlabama\nAlaska386\n27708,436\n2,272\n73,948\n405,592\n1,519,549\n37,0002.0%\n0.0%1,835\n8413\n20\nArizona\nArkansas\nCalifornia\nColorado\nConnecticut\nDelaware\nDistrict of Columbia210\n101\n2,775\n108\n416\n60\n36\n386\n517\n90.2% 352 17\n1.2% 4,016 27\n4.3% 548 13\n0.1%\n0.1%343\n4760\n19,666 12\n14,886\n551\n107, 387\n280, 866\n165\n466,293\n4,624\n613,053\n1,026,7080.0% 248 40\n0.0% 15 8\nFlorida\nGeorgia\nGuam\nHawaii\nIdaho\nIllinois\nIndiana\nIowa\nKansas0.3%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n1.3%\nO.OY\n1.7%\n2.9%278 16\n543 11\n18 70\n23\n23\n836-710\n144\n21320,274 35\n201 28\n733 10- -- -- -----1,446 13\n51, 095 0.1 % 355 9\n1,349,985 3.8% 6,338 9\nKentuc\nLouisiana\nMaine\nMa land297\n368\n87\n469\n415\n493\n340\n~ 164\n330\n62\n1194,945 0.6% 656 27\n4,789,750 13.6%\n0.0%\n0.1%\n0.1%\n1.8%\n1.0%\n4.5%\n0.8%\n0.0%\n0.0%13,016 11\n3,048 35 8\n47,995 102 9\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nMinnesota\nMississippi\nMissouri\nMontana\nNavajo Nation\nNebraska\nNevada29,285 71\n1,274\n1,029\n9,695\n854\n114\n3\n424\n15614\n17\n9627,889\n349,886\n~ 1,590,017 7\n281,820 11\n7,065 9\n3\n29, 225\n14,688\n3,293\n396,104\n889,2564\n22\n13\n42\n_ 48\n8769 0.1 %\n94\n1340.0%\nNew Hampsh ire\nNew Jersey\nNew Mexico0.0%\n1.1%25\n711 557\n41 2.5%_\n21,689\nNew York 3,095 234,378\n77,163\n375,751\n00.7% 76 4\n22\n6\n0North Carolina 675 0.2%\n1.1q\n0.0%114\n14,452\n0North Dakota 26\nNorthern Marianas 0\nOhio 975 1,539,561 4.4% 1,579 16\nOklahoma 170 100, 331 0.3% 590 7\nOre on 210 56,930 0.2% 271 10\nPenns lvania 1,004 257,716 0.7%\n0.1%\n0.0%257\n382\n598\n22\n17Puerto Rico 94 35,902\nRhode Island 103 6,083\nSouth Carolina 386 176,950 0.5% 458 8\nSouth Dakota 31 1,460 0.0% 47 7\nTennessee 363 97,020 0.3% 267 6\nTexas 970 15,624,473 44.4% 16,108 7\nTrust Territories 0 0 0.0% 0 0\nUtah 127 40,359 0.1% 318 28\n2-10\n\nEXHIBIT 2-5: LQG HAZARDOUS WASTE QUANTITIES AND NUMBER OF WASTE STREAMS GENERATED BY\nSTATE' (2013)\nPERCENTAGE OFHAZARDOUS WASTE AVERAGE\nNUMBER OF TOTAL HAZARDOUS TOTAL GENERATED PER NUMBER OF\nFACILITIES WASTE GENERATED HAZARDOUS FACILITY WASTE STREAMS\nSTATE IN BR DATA (TONS) WASTE (TONS) PER FACILITY\n[A] B C D [E=C/B F]\nVermont 43 3,323 0.0% 77 12\nVirgin Islands 1 10,064 0.0%~ 10,064 17\nVirginia 397 58,641 0.2%~ 148 12\nWashington 258,975 0.7% 568 16 456\nWest Virginia 144 52,027 0.1% 361 10\nWisconsin--424 204, 520__\n0.6% 482 9\nWyoming 22 3,493 0.0~ 159 13\nTOTALz 20,771 35,151,466 100.0% 1, 692 13\nNotes:\n1.

Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (OS-300)\nTO: Karl E. Bremer, Chief\nRCRA Permitting Branch\nOffice of RCRA, Region 5 (HRP-8J)\nThis is in response to your memorandum of November 20,1992\nregarding Heritage Environmental Services, Inc. in Lemont,\nIllinois, and the burning of a propellant mixture (mostly butane\nand propane) in the company's boiler. You specifically asked\nwhether the burning of this mixture constitutes burning of a\nhazardous waste which would require them to comply with the boiler\nand industrial furnace (BIF) regulations.\nSubpart H of 40 CFR Part 266 regulates the burning or\nprocessing of hazardous waste in boilers and industrial furnaces.\nHowever, before a substance can be classified as a hazardous waste,\nit must first meet the definition of a solid waste. In determining\nwhether the butane and propane propellants are solid wastes, it\nmust also be decided whether the burning of these materials\nconstitutes the burning for energy recovery of a propellant (is a\nsolid waste), or use as a fuel (is not a solid waste) for the\nreasons stated below.\nAs stated in your memo, Heritage plans to recover the\nmaterials from the aerosol cans and separate them into three\nstreams: (1) scrap metal (crushed cans), (2) a liquid phase\n(household chemicals), and (3) a gaseous phase (propellants, mostly\nbutane and propane). Heritage then plans to burn the recovered\npropellants from the aerosol cans in their on-site boiler for\nRO 11717\n\nenergy value.\nAccording to 40 CFR Section 261.2(c)(2)ii regulations,\ncommercial chemical products that are listed in 40 CFR Section\n261.33 as well as non-listed commercial chemical products that\nexhibit hazardous waste characteristics (see attached Apri111,\n1985 Federal Register notice explaining the regulatory status of\nnon-listed commercial chemical products), are not classified as\nsolid wastes when burned for energy recovery if they are themselves\nfuels. Since propane and butane are materials that are normally\nboth used as fuels, when unused, they can be burned as fuels\nwithout being considered solid wastes.\nTherefore, if the aerosol cans are full (not used), or\npartially full (in which case they would be considered off\nspecification with the remaining propellants in the cans also being\nunused), then the butane and propane propellants would be\nclassified as commercial chemical products. Since these products\nare fuels and being burned for energy recovery, they would not fall\nwithin the definition of a solid waste and would consequently not\nbe considered a hazardous waste.\nFor the reasons stated above, Heritage would not be required\nto comply with the BIF regulations to burn the butane and propane\npropellants in their on-site boiler. However, this determination\nassumes that other hazardous constituents have been separated from\nthe butane and propane propellants, and that the butane and propane\nare indeed being burned for energy recovery rather than to destroy\nother hazardous constituents contained in the aerosol cans.\nIf you have any additional questions or would like to discuss\nthis further, please contact Karen Randolph of my staff on (703)\n308-8651.\nAttachment\ncc: Christine Dibble, OSW; Mike Petruska, CAD; Steve\nSilverman, OGC; Bob Holloway, WMD; Sonya Sasseville, PSPD\nbcc: Juana Rojo, Region 5; Waste Combustion Permit Writers'\nWorkshop; Karen Randolph PSPD\nRO 11717\n\nATTACHMENT 22\n\n9432.1988(04)\nAEROSOL CANS, ON-SITE DEPRESSURIZATION OF\nOFFICE OF SOLID WASTE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE\nSEP 1988\nKurt E. Whitman, Project Coordinator\nSWInc.\nP.O. Box B\nSaukville, WI 53080\nDear Mr. Whitman:\nThis is in response to your July 1,19881etter requesting\nclarification on EPA's current interpretation on whether the\ndepressurization of aerosol cans on-site would be considered\ntreatment, requiring a RCRA permit. You also requested\npertinent information on Ril #43 and on whether or not it has\nbeen rescinded. I am enclosing per your request a copy of Ril\n43 and the 1985 memorandum which I believe is the one you are\nrequesting.\nYou revealed in a July 26, 1988 telephone conversation with\nDoreen Sterling of my staff that your main interest in this\nissue was to determine the requirements for disposal of a wide\nvariety of aerosol cans located at a number of Department of\nDefense facilities throughout the country.\nThe Agency is aware that conflicting interpretations have\nbeen given by the EPA Regional Offices, EPA Office of Solid\nWaste, and the RCRA Hotline regarding whether certain aerosol\ncan disposal methods constitute treatment and whether or not a\npermit is required for this activity. The Agency is currently\nevaluating this problem and may decide to issue more specific\nguidance in the future if it is warranted. It is our policy,\nhowever, to refer issues of this nature to the Region in which\nthe facility is located since they are normally best able to\nmake acase-by-case determination on whether: (1) the waste in\nquestion is hazardous according to our regulations and\n(2) treatment is occurring.\nRO 13225\n\nAccording to our regulations, cans are hazardous if: (1)\nthey contain a commercial chemical product on the 40 CFR\n261.33(e) or (f) lists or exhibit one or more of the hazardous\nwaste charactreistics, and are not empty as defined under Sec.\n261.7; and/or (2) they exhibit any of the characteristics of\nhazardous waste identified in Part 261, Subpart C.\nTreatment, as defined in 40 CFR 260.10, means any method,\ntechnique, or process, including neutralization, designed to\nchange the physical, chemical, or biological character or\ncomposition of any hazardous waste so as to neutralize such\nwaste, or so as to recover energy or material resources from the\nwaste, or so as to render such waste nonhazardous, or less\nhazardous; safer to transport, store, or dispose of; or amenable\nfor recovery, amenable for storage, or reduced in volume.\nIt should be noted that if any of the aerosol cans are\nincluded as part of household waste (i.e., from military\nhousing), those cans are exempt from RCRA Subtitle under\nSection 261.4(b)(1).\nIf you have any further questions, you may contact Doreen\nSterling of my staff at 202-475-6775.\nSincerely\nOriginal Document signed\nSylvia K Lowrance, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\nEnclosures\nRO 13225\n\nATTACHMENT 23\n\nPPC 9443.1984(10)\nSMALL ARMS AMMUNITION REACTIVITY, OFF SPECIFICATION\n30 NOV 1984\nMEMORANDUM\nSUBJECT: Classification of Small Arms Ammunition\nWith Respect to Reactivity\nFROM: John H. Skinner, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste (WH-562)\nTO: David Wagoner, Director\nAir &Waste Management Division\nRegion VIII\nRecently, a question arose as to the status under RCRA of\noff-specification small arms ammunition (ball or sporting\nammunition of calibers up to and including 0.50) intended for\ndisposal. The issue concerned whether such wastes are \"reactive\nwastes\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6) and, therefore,\nsubject to RCRA hazardous waste requirements. Because the\nammunition contains an ignition source that maybe shock and heat\nsensitive and is designed to generate high pressure during use, it\nhad been our opinion that it is probably \"reactive.\" However, on\nthe basis of information that was received from the Remington\nArms Company and the Army, we now conclude that such materials\nare no \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).\nSection 261.23 (a)(6) of Title 40 provides that a solid\nwaste which is \"capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it\nis subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under\nconfinement\" is \"reactive.\" As discussed in the May 19, 1980,\npreamble to 40 CFR 261.23, shock and thermal instability are\nimportant elements of this definition. While presently there is\nno Agency guidance regarding these criteria, the Remington Arms\nCompany of Independence, Missouri, and the U.S. Army have provided\ninformation which addresses both of these factors.\nRemington Arms Company submitted details on the effects of\nheat and impact to small arms ammunition. There was no explosion\nRO 12339\n\nwhen a box of ammunition was set afire. Small arms, when subjected\nto the SAAMI (Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute)\nImpact Test, showed no evidence of mass propagation or explosion.\nThe Department of the Army has a rigorous safety and hazard\ntesting program on all munition items. The tests, which include\ndrop tests from 5, 7, and 40 feet to simulate handling errors\nand \"heating under confinement,\" 160\u00b0F for 48 hours, also\nshowed no evidence of detonation or explosion with respect to\nsmall arms ammunition. The tests were performed on both the\nindividual munition and a package containing a prescribed number\nof items.\nAs noted above, we feel that results from these tests show\nthat off-specification small caliber ammunition up to and including\n0.50 is not \"reactive\" within the meaning of 40 CFR ~261.23(a)(6).\nWe, therefore, believe that the disposal of such ammunition is not\nsubject to Subtitle C hazardous waste requirements.\nWe appreciate your cooperation.

Section 3001 of that Subtitle requires EPA to\nidenkify the characteristics of and list hazardous wastes.\nWastes identified ox listed as hazardous will be included in\nthe management control system creaCed by Sections 3002-3005\nand 3010. Wastes not identified or listed will be subject to\nthe requirements far non-hazardous waste imposed bq the States\nunder Subtitle D. The Agency has determined that reactivi:v\nis a hazardous character~skic,because improperly managed\nreactive wastes (i.e. , explosives, etc.) pose a substantial\npresent or potential danger to human health and the environment.\nThe purpose of this document is to explain the Agency's\ndefinikion of reactive wastes, to discuss the comments received\non the proposed definition of reactive waste (43 FR 58956,\nDecember 18, 2978) and the changes subsequently made.\nII. Proposed Regulation\nReactive waste. (1) Definition - A solid waste is a\nhazardous waste if a representative sample of the vasCe:~\n(i) Is normally unstable and readily undergoes violent\nchemical change without detonating; reacts violently with\neater, Forms potentially explosive mixtures with water, o-\ngenerates toxic gases, vapors, or fumes when mixed with water;\n-2-\n\nor is a cyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate\ntoxic gases, vapors, ox fumes when exposed to mild acidic or\nbasic conditions.\n(zi) Is capable o~ detonation or expZasive reac~ion but\nrequires a strong initiating source or which must be heated\nunder confinement before initiation can take place, or which\nreacts explosively with water.\n(iii) Is readily capable of detonation ar of explosive\ndecomposition or reaction at normal temperatures and pressuzes.\n(iv) Is a Forbidden explosive as defined in 49 CF R\n173.51, a Class A explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.53, or a\nClass B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.58.\nNOTE --Such waste includes pyrophoric.substances,\nexplosives, autopolymeri'zation material and oxiaizing\nagents. If it i~ not apparent whether a waste is a\nhazardous waste using this description, then the\nmethods cited below or equivalent methods can be used\nko determine if the waste is hazardous waste.\nIdenti~ication method. (1) Thermally unstable waste\ncan he identified using the Explosion Temperature Test cited\nin Appendix II of this Subpart (waste for which explosion,\nignition, ar decomposition occurs at 125\"C after 5 r~nutes is\nclassed as hazardous waste).\n(i) Waste unstable to mechanical shock can be i~entif~ed\n\u2022 using the Bureau of Explosives impact apparatus and the tests\ncited in 49 CFR 173.53 (b), {c), (d}, or {f), as aparooria~e.\n_,~\n\nIII. Rationale for Proposed Regulation\nA. Rationale far proposing a reactivity characteristic\nReactivity was chosen as a characteristic of hazardous\nwastie because improperly managed reactive wastes present a\ndanger to human health and the environment. By definition,\nreactive wastes are those which are capable of violently\ngenerating heat and pressure, reacting vigorously with air or\nwater, reacting with water to generate toxic Fumes, etc. The\ndangers which these wastes pose to transporters, waste disposal\npersonnel, and the public are thus for the most part obvious.\nIn the past, there have been a number of incidents of damage\nto persons or property which have resulted from the improper\nrtanagement of reactive wastes. Sorne of these damage incidents\nare listed and discussed in Appendix I.\nBecause of their acknowledged danger, reactive materials\naxe often controlled by federal and state regulations and\nsuggestions for their safe use or management are oFten\npublished by public or private organizations. Some o\u00a3 these\nfederal and state regulations and the guideline's for reactive\nmaterials prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association\n(NFPA) .are lzsted and discussed in Appendix II.\nB. Rationale for proposed reactivity definition\nReactive substances can be described as those which:\nI) autopolymerize\n2) are unstable with respect to heat or shock\n3) are explosive\n_~-\n\n4) are strong oxidizers\n5) react vigorously with air or Water\n6) react with water to generate toxic fumes\nAs can be seen from this description, Lhe tern \"reac~ivitq\"\nencompasses a diverse and somewhat loosely conjoined class of\nphysical properties or effects. These effects are not mu~ually\nzxclusive and a particulaz substance might exhibit several of\nthe properties mentioned above. For instance, ce::ain\nperoxides would fall into four of the above six ca~egories.\nAdditionally, these categories overlap not only wi:h each\nother, but also with the other characteristics. For exa~~le,\nthe difference between flammability ~confla\u00a2rzCioa} and eti-\nplosiveness (deflagration) is only one ofdegree -- an illustra-\nlion of the fact that the properties enbrac?d by tie terx\n\"reactivity\" are, like the term \"reactivitq\" itse?~, relztive\nproperties which have meaning only in a relative sense.\nThe Agency has aCtempted where possible to de_ine\nhazardous waste characCeristics in terms of speciric,\nnumerically quanti.\u00a3ied properties measurable by standardized\nand available testing protocols. This has aroven 3ifficult\nin the case o~ reactive wastes. The first oroble~ ~:ith\nconstructing a numerically quantified definition cf reactive\nwastes arises from the fact that Che tern \"reacti~ity\" e~~races\na wide variety of different (though overlapping) ~\u00b0sects,\neach of which can be triggered by an eaually Wide variety of\ninitiaCing conditions or forces. IC would 3e cum:?rsome, if\nnot completely impractical, to construct a :\u25bauneri~ally\n_5_\n\nquantified definition which included all these different\neffects and their potential initiating farces. The second\nproblem arises from the Fact, as noted above, that the\npropez~ies embraced by the term reactivity are relative\nproperties. The determination that something \"reacts vigorously\nwith air or water\" or a.s \"unstable with respect to heat or\nshock\" is a relative determination, not an absolute one. The\neffects bezng measured proceed along a continuum. Thus, it\nis ditfi.cult to draw the line at any particular point.\nThese problems are reflected in the testing methods\nwhich might be used to identify reactive substances. These\nmethods suffer from the following generic deficiences:\n1. The available tests are too specific and do not\nreflect the wide variety of waste management\nconditions.\nThe available tests are used to determine how a specific\naspect or manifestation of waste reactivity behaves under a\nspecia]. and specific type of stress. For example, DTA\n(Differential Thermal Analysis) measures how the rate of\ntemperature rise of the waste (one specific aspect of waste\nreactivity.) correJ.ates with the slow input of thermal energy\n(one special and specific type of stress) . This would not\nindicate how the waste reacts to mechanical shock (a drop\ntest would be necessary to determine that); electrical shock,\nwhether the waste is a strong oxidizer, or even what is\nproducing the rate of temperature cYiange (pressure buildup,\ntoxic or nontoxic L-'umes, heat of mixing, etc.). ~'he in~ormation\nderived fxom the available tests; then, is too specialized\n\nand does not reflect the wide varieCy of stresses and initiating\nforces likely to be found in a disposal environment.\n2. Reactivity of a sample may nor reflect reactivity of\nthe whole waste:\nIn the case of wastes which are thermally unstable, the\nreactivity of the sample map not adequately reflect the\nreactivity of the whole Waste. The kinetics of reaction are\nnot only a \u00a3unction of the available initiating sources and\nambient temperature, but are also a function of the mass,\nconfiguration, geometry, etc. of the sample. Foz a \"runaway\"\nreaction to occur, the system must transcend that steady\nsCate where the energy (heat) produced by reaction is equal\nto the energy transferred to the surroundings from the re-\nacting mass. When this critical temperature is reached, the\nmass experiences catastrophic self-heating. This heat\ntransfer phenomena is a tunct~on of sample s1ze, density, and\ngeometry. As demonstxaCed in equation 1:5\nCdtldt QVp exp (-E/RT) + hS (T - To) (1)\nC me (m=mass and c = specific heat)\nT = Temperature of the material\nQ ~ Heat of decoaposition\nV A Volume\np = Aensity\nE Activation energy\nR Gas constant\nh Keat transfer coefficient\nS = Surface are of the material\n_~_\n\nAs can be seen from this equation the rate of temperature\nrise will be affected both by the intensive properties of the\nwaste, such as density, and the expensive properties of the ,\nwaste, such as surface area and geometry. Since the extensive\nproperties o~ the sample are likely to be different from tie\nextensive properties of the whole waste, the reactivity of\nthe sample may not reflect the reactivity of the whole was~e.\n3. The test zesuZts are in most cases subjective or\nnet directly applicable.\nThe ideal test to use in a regulatory program is usually\none which zequires minimal interpretation. 'I~e majority o\u00b0\navailable reactivity testing methods are not o~ the \"nass-\nfail\" type. Rather, these testing methods usually produce\ntest results which consist o\u00a3 a first order differential\nplotted against time or against a standard, from which relative\nreactivity can be assessed. When a test of this sort is run,\nit is not run to determine \"reactivity\" per se 'gut rather ~a\nelicit information concerning how \"fast\" a material reacts\n(i.e. kinetic information) or how vigorously it reacts (thermo-\n3ynamic information). Thus, the decision as to whether a\nwaste is reactive requires subjective interpretation o~ the\ntest results.\nAdditionally, the information derived From such tests\nmay not be directly r~lated~to reactivity. for example, tie\ntest results might provide znformatian on the activateion\nenergy - a useful, but potentially misleading bit of information\nsince it reflects the speed of the reaction rasher than the\n\nreaction's effects. The inapplicabiLitq of some of the rest\nresults emphasizes the indefinite meaning of the term\n\"reacCivity\", a term which draws its meaning \u00a3rom the context\nof its use. A chemist might think of a \"reactive\" subsCance\nas one with a small activa[ion enezgy the energy difference\nbeCween the reactive substance's initial and transition\nstates), i.e., one which reacts easily. The Agency, however,\nunlike the hypothetical chemist, is not just interested in\nthings that react \"easily\" but also i.n~Chings which react\nvigorously. It consequently needs to take into account not\njust the activation energq of a substance but also the heat\no\u00a3 reaction, the molecu~arity o\u00a3 the reaction and a~her ,\nfactors - information which the available tests often do not\nsupply. It is, in other words, not really interested in\nperforming a Chermodynamic measurement, but rather in observing\ni\u00a3 a waste be:~aves in such a wzy as to pose a danger under\nnormal handling conditions.\n4. 'the standardized methods that do exist were not\nc~eveloped for waste testing.\nUse of the available testing methods on waste materials\noften resulCs in the applicaEion of standardized methods to\nnon standardized samples and the application of standardized\nmethods to samples with physical consistencies the method Was\nnat designed for. If such methods are used., the results\nmight be difficult to interpreC with cerCainty.\nThe available reacCi.vity testing methods are individuaLl.y\n-9-\n\ndescribed and evaluated in Appendix 3*. As is evident from\nthose specific evaluations and From the oreceeding discussion\nof the generic shortcomings of the available testing methods,\nnave of these \"type\" methods are suitable for use to\nunequivocally determine if a waste presents a reactive hazard.\nFar essentially the same reasons, a numerically quantified\ndefinition of reactive waste is not feasible. This is not as\nAig a problem as might be thought on initial reflection.\nMost generators whose wastes are dangerous because they are\nreactive are well aware of this property of their waste.\nReactive wastes present special problems in handXing, storage\nand transprot. Also, reactive wastes are rarely generated\nfrom unreactive feed stocks oX in processes producing unreactive\nproducts or intermediates. Furthermore, the problems posed\nby reactive was~es appear to be confine8 to a Fairly narrow\ncategory of wastes. The damage incidents show that the major\nproolems seem to be the formation of hydrogen sulfide (A2S)\nfrom either soluble sulfides or biological degradation o.f\nsulfur containing wastes, the formation of hydrogen cyanide\n(HCN) from soluble cyanides, and the explosion o\u00a3 some\n*These evaluations are taken from \"A Seeond Appraisal of\nMethods for Estimatin Selt Reaction Hazards\", E.

Since the available testing methods are not ideal\nfor identifying those wastes cateQoriz~d as hazardous due to\nreactivity, the approach chosen is to prescribe a.prose\ndescription of reactive waste far self-determination bq\ngenerators and to list wastes which meet this description and\nh ave been identified as reacCive.\nThe prose definition chosen is a paraphrase of the top\nthree of the reactive classes of the National Fire Protection\nassociation ~NFPA) reactivity classification system. The\nother two classes in the NFPA classification scheme are not\nincluded since Chese would include materials which are inert\nunder normal handling conditions.

Comments Received on the Proposed ~aracteristics\nand the Agency's Response to These Comments\nThe Agency received approximately forty comment letters\naddressing reactivity. These letters contained approximately\nsixty discrete recommendations or comrr.~n~s on tre proposed\nregulation (in some letters more than one point was addressed).\nSeveral of the commenters \u00a3elt that the proposed reactivity\ndefinition was adequate and pznvides dssirable flexibility\nfor the generator to. use judgement. A~wever, the large\nmajority o\u00a3 comments expressed concern with the Agency's\nreactivity characteristic. These cominen~s have been categorized\nby either contend or the portion of tre regulation addressed.\nA discussion of these follows:\nA. A large majority of the comments ~eal~ with the asserted\nlack of spee~fic~ty and ambiguity of tze prose definition.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued t~a~ the prose definition\nemployed by the Agency is, as a General mater, too\nvague and should be replaced by ~ numerically quanti-\nfied definition accompanied by aparopriate testing\nprotocols. This comment leas beer_ fully addressed in\nPart III above and need not be ac3ressed further here.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters argued ~z~t the inclusion in\nthe definition of wastes which \"Generate toxic gases,\nvapors, ox fumes when mixed wi`.~ water\" and of \"cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes] wn~~~. can generate toxic\ngases, vapors, oz fumes when e~~~s.e3 to mild acidic\n-14-\n\nor basic conditions\" needs to be made amore specific.\nSeveral of the commenters suggested that a phrase\nsuch as \"in harmful quantita.es\" be irse~tec into the\nproposed regulat~.ons as follows: \"...or ger_erates\ntoxic gases, vapors, or fumes in harnful aLantities\nwhen mixed with water\"; \"or is a cya~i~e or sulfide\nbearing waste which can generate toxic gases, vapors,\nor fumes in harmful quantities when exposed to mild .\nacidic or basic conditions.\" The comments on the\ncyanide and sulfide bearing. wastes all poi.^.fed out\nthat everything contains sulfides anc r,.ost =kings\ncontain cyanides (albeit in trace amoun~s) ~n3 many\no\u00a3 these can generate minute quai:tities of 1y3r~gen\nsulfide or hydrogen cy~nic~e under mildly acidi..c or\nbasic conditions. The Agency is sym~~.~:zeti^ ~o these\nconceicns, and, in antici.pata.on of such. orob'_e~s, had\nattempted to make clear in the preamble and background\ndocuments that khe Agency was leavi,na the determination\nof reactivity hazard up to the reasonable ~idc~ement\nof the generator based upon the generator's past\nexperience with the waste. Taka.ng t'nis coffin sense\napproach, such material as soil or flyash w~~.:~ suicides\n.contamination (examples of sulfide an3 ~yan~de bearing\nwastes supplied by the commenters) woul3 cls~,~ly rot\nmeet the reactivity definition. D~spit~ th'_s, the\npoint made by tY~e commenters is certainly v=lid. ^here-\nfore, so that there will be no confus=on; t::~ r~gen~y has\n-15-\n\nchanged the final regulation to make it more specific, as\nfollows: \"...or generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes:\nin quantities sufficient to preszrt a danger to public ,\nhealth or the environment when mixed with water; or is a\ncyanide or sulfide bearing waste which can generate toxic\ngases, vapors or fumes in quantities sufficient to pxesent a\ndanger to public health or the environment when exposed. ..\"\nThis would certainly better reflect our regulatory intent.\nA number of commenters advocated that the Agency specify\nwhat is meant by mildly acidic or basic conditions. One\ncommenter specified a pH range (5 to 9'), but offered no\nrationale as to why this particular range should be used.\nSince a 5ubstantal percentage of the commenters found the\nphrase \"m~idTy acidic or basic\" to be rather nebulous, the\nAgency has decided that a specific p~ range should be speei-\nfeed. The pH range chosen is thaw w'~ich is considered non-\nhazardous by the corrosivity charac~eristic (2 < pH <12.5).\n'Phis range was chosen because any li\u2022~uid outside the range\nis hazardous and requires management within the Subtitle C\nregulations. Only liquid wastes inside this range can be\nlandfilled without regard to the strictures on compatibility\nimposed by the Subtitle C regulations and co-disposed with\nwastes containing soluble cyanides or sulfides. These are\nthen the most stringent pH cvnditio~s which a waste could be\nsubjected to outside of a Subtitle C Facility. (natural\nwaters are unlikely to be outside this pH range).\n-16-\n\n\u00b0 Several commenters suggested that the definition of\ncyanide bearing waste should distinguish between \"\u00a3xee\ncyanide\" and ferro cyanide\" since the latter would not\nbe available to generate hydrogen cyanide under mild\nacidic or basic conditions. Thp Agency beleives that\nsuch a clarification is nat necessary. If the cyanide\nis unavailable under the s~eci\u00a3ied acidic or basic\nconditions then toxic hydrogen cyanide fumes cannot he\ngenerated and the wastes containing these unavailable\ncyanides are not reackive. To s~ec~fy these as exemp-\ntions would be redundant and by implication might lead\ngenerators to conclude that other unavailable sulfides\nor cyanides NOT specifically exempted, do neet the\nreactivity chazacteristic.\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated~speci~ying the cancen-\ntration of sulfide or cyanide needed to make cyanide\nor sulfide bearing wastes hazardous. As explained above,\nthe identity of wastes which generate toxic gases under\nthe conditions specified in the ~efinition~should be\nobvious to the generator and thus, this level o\u00a3 sophi-\nstication~is unnecessary.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency specify a\nrate of evolution of toxic gas, but included no sugges-\ntions as to how to do so. The tigency is unsure of how\na laboratory test method measuring gas evolution rate\n-17-\n\ncould be developed which could then be neaning`ully\nrelated to field conditions. Therefore, an evoluticn\nrate of toxic gas will not be included in the final\nregulations.\n\u00b0 One commenter argued that sulfides and cyanides should\nnot be singled out in-the regula4ians and further\nskated that all other poCential Toxic fume generators\nbe included or, alternatively, that no toxic fume gen\u2014\nerators be included. The Agency disagrees. According\nto information which the Agency has in its possession\n(see Appendix F), the primary wastes implicated in the\ngeneration of Coxic gas are su?f'_des and cyanides. Thus,\nthe Agency would be remiss if it did not speci_`y these\ntypes of wastes. If others are identified, :hey will\nbe included also.\nB. A number of commenters argued that the test protocols\nproposed in 5ecti.on 250.13 (c)C2) of the regulations were\nexpensive, unreliable and nak specific enough. Additionaliq,\nseveral ocher commenters had problems wiCh specific test\nprotocols. For instance, same commenters argued t~a.t the\n125\u00b0C temperature adopted for the Explosion Tempera~ure Test\nwas not a reasonable temperature and hat decomposi=ion, a~\nused in this test, needs to be defined.)\nAs a result of some preli.ninary cork undertakes 3y k`e\nAgency on khe explosion Temperature 7es~* and after :evie~ n~\n*Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?:acedures aa3 ~arieus\nHazard Ldentification Tests (Final ~eoort)\", NUS C~roora~ion,\nSeptember, 1979, (see Appendix IV).\n\u201418--\n\nthe comments received on these test pTOtgCO~S* (and in ciew of the\ngenetic problems with such tests, discussed above and.iz ~ppen3i~\nIII), the Agency has decided tp remove Lhe test ~rotoco?s from\n\u00a7261.23 of the regulations. The A~encq agrees in general that\ntheq are are unsuitable in defining a \"reactive\" waste ;or RCR~\nregulatory purvoses. T.he A~encY has accordingly zemoved the des-\nignated test protocols from the regulations except to tie extent\nthaC the DepartmenC of Transportation's definiCion of C1ass.A\nexplosives requires use of the shock instability test. As a rzsult\nof this decision, the Agency does not believe it is necessary to\ndiscuss the individual concerns on the various test pro~ocols.\nC. A number of commenters argued that only under land=ill coa-\nditions will a waste be subjected to strong initiating sources\nor heated ander canfinemant. Therefore, they stated [hat since\nno landFillin~ of explosive waste is permitted, these conditions\nwill never occur and Section 25Q.13(c}C1}iii) is unnecessary.\nThis argument is completely circular. If Section 250.13\nCc)(1)(ii) were removed from Che re~ula4ions, exalosive Wastes\nwould not be considered hazardous and c'ould be disposed of in\na sanitary landfill, thus subiectin~ Che castes to the very\nconditions which the commenters contend will cause the waste\nto explode'. In any event, the Agency does not agree that a\nlandfill is the only place in which strong initiating farces\n*Comments were received from [he public on Lhe proposed\nreactivity test protocols both during she 90-dam comment\nperiod on the proposed 53001 re~ulatio~s (43 FR X8956? cad\nin response to the solicitation of con~eats on the NU5 report\n(Evaluation of Solid Waste Extraction ?rocedures and r~rious\nHazard Identification Tests) which was noticed ~n the 'e3era?\nRegister on December 28, 1.979 (44 ~R 76827-76828)\n-19-\n\nor heating under pressure can occur. Pressure increase can\nbe caused by confinement (e.g. , a d-rum) together with\ntemperature increase (e.g. , caused by miming) or gas generation\n(e.g. , desulubilization of gases or deco~posiCion into gases).\nD. A number of commenters advocated exe~ptin~ emergency\nsituations i.e., homemade bombs) from coverage of RCRA so\nthat emergency Ceams can dispose Qf these explosive materials\nas expeditiously as possible without delay (i.e. , without\nrequiring a manifest, etc.) .\nThe regulation already makes acco~~odation for cases of\nimminent hazard in 5263.30. Thus, emergency handling of\nexplosive wastes would be exempted by this section.\nE. Other Comments\n\u00b0 A number of commenters advocated that all the character-\nistics 'be made as flexible as the reactiviCy character-\nistic.\nThe Agency disagrees with these commenCs; the broad\nmeaning and generic character of the reactivity \"uni-\nverse\" requires a flexible characteristic. The Agency\nwould have preferred Co define reactivity by speC~fic\ntest pro[ocols. However, this is not possible. Thy\nother character~sitics, (except imitable solids) can\nbe delineated o..r gauged by measurzmeat of one Cor a\nfew) specific chemical/physical ~roverties; therefore,\nthe Agency will continue to define the ignitable.\ncorrosive, and toxicity characteristic as proposed.\n-~0-\n\n\u00b0 Ong commenter argued that just because a was~e may\nundergo a violent chemical change with another waste\n~s no reason to consider a waste hazardous. To illu-\nstrate this point, the commenter pointed out tha~ an\nacid and base when mixed will undezgo vio~en~ chemical\nchange, but that such mixing (ne~~~.ralization) is a\nnecessary part of many treatment systems an3 should\nnot be prohibited.\nThe Agency believes this commenter to be under a mis-\napprehension about the scope of the reactivi~y d~\u00a3i-\nnition. The definition of reactivity refers to wastes\nwhich undergo violent change in an uncontrol'ed ~:anner\neither by themselves, or when mixed with water. There-\nfore, the example o~ neutralization given by the commen.~er\nis inanpropria~e, in as much as that example invalves ~~e\nmixing of wastes. Furthermore, tie Agency does ~.o~\nbelieve that the example given Uy the commencer is a fair\nrepresentation of the hazards posed by wastes caoabLe\nof undergoing a violent chemical change. 'Lhe exartple\ngiven involves the controlled interaction he~ween two\nwastes which is a treatment technique and. thLs dies not\nreflect the hazards presented by uncontrolled violent\nchemical change characteristic o\u00a3 waste mana~eme~t\nsituaeions.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the definition. o~ zsactive\nwaste be subdivided into sections which mig:~~ be later\n-21_\n\nindexed into a compatibility chart.\nThe primary purpose of Section 3001 is to identify\nhazardous Wastes, and not to dictate management tech-\npiques. Section 3004 will address the various management\nCechniques including incompatible wastes ~se.e X265.17\nof the regulations). An appendix to the regulations\n(Appendix 5 in Part 265) is provided with just such infor-\nmatron.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the Agency allow a genera -\nfor to use any tesk that is believed appropriate \u00a3or\ndetermining reacCivity. Similarly, one commenter\nsuggested that Appendix III to this background document\nbe removed because it might discourage ase of a su~Cable\ntest.\nThis comment must be evaluated zn Light of the\nAgency's decision not to prescribe any tesCs nor mea-\nsuria~ reactivity. Ordinarilq, when the Agency pre-\nscribes a specific test for measuring a characteristic,\nthe generator is free to employ a different test if he\ncan demonstrate, in accordance with the equivalency\nprocedurees set forth in Subpart E, that his test is\nequivalent to the Agency -prescribed test. 5z~ce Che\nagency has elected not to prescribe any test protocols\nfor measuring reactivity, the question 'of equivivalent\ntest methods is largely mooted: test results are no\nlonger determinative of whether a waste is reac~ive\nand there is nothing against which to measure equivalency.\n\u20142Z'\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the use of tests by\nthe generators is precluded. The generator is \u00a3xee\nto conduct any tests which aid him in assessing whether\nhis waste fits within the prose definition of reactivity.\nHowever, the Agency is not bound in any way by these\ntests and will make its assessment of whether a wasCe\nis reactive by reference to the prose definition.\nIf a generator devises a rest method which he be-\nIieves adequatelq measures the reactivity of a waste, he\nshould submit that Cest method to the Agency nor evalua-\nlion.\n\u00b0 One commenter suggested that the agency address reacti-\nvity over time in the \u2022definition since a material maq\nundergo physical and chemical changes as it ages and\nbecome extremely reactive, whereas it might not be\nreactive when first generated.\nThe Agency agrees with the commenter Chao some\nmaterials, such as certain ethers, can become more re-\nactive with time. However, the Agency has no information\n(such as damage incidents) concerning any wastes which\nmight present this type of preblem. Additionally, khe\nAgency is not aware of any testing method by which such\nwastes might be identified. Therefore, the final regula-\nlion will not address reactivity over time per se; as\nChese wastes are identified by the Agency then mill be\nlisted in Subpart D of Part 261 of the regulations.\n-23-\n\nOne commencer objected to the Agency defining as reactive\nthose wastes which are capable of detonation or explosive\nreaction i\u00a3 subjected to a strong initiating source or\nheated under confinement. The commenter asserted that\nmany inert, non-reactive materials, including Cap Water,\ncan be triggered to detonate or explode under confinement\nwhen subjected to strong, heat, pressure, or a combinaCion\nof these and other initiating sources.\nThe Agencq disagrees with this commenter and rakes\nspecific issue with Che assertion thzt mane relatively\ninert substances could be made to explode when subjec^\nted to extreme heat and pressure. Ia any event, even\nif relatively inert substances could be made to explode\nwhen subjected to str~ttg heat and pressure, these sub-\n.stances would noC be considered reactive under the pro-\nposed definition. The Ageney is only concerned with\nsubstances capable of exploding under reasonable confine-\nwent conditions -- i.e., those confiae~ent conditions\nlikely to be encountered in disposal environments.\nV; Promulgated Regulations\nAs a result of EPA's review of the conaents regarding\nthe rea'ctivi'ty characteristic, EPA is promuL~ating a reactivity\ncharacteristic which significantly differs `rim ~~e proposed\nzegulations in two aspects: the thermal instability and shock\ninstability Cest protocols cited in the pro?osed regulation\nhas been removed and the section relaCive to generation o\u00a3\ntoxic gas, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sul`ide has been\n-24-\n\nmade amore svecific.

Nebrich, Jr.\nTechnical Director\nWaste Technology Services, Inc.\n640 Park Place,\nNiagra Falls, New York, 14301\nDear Mr. Nebrich:\nThank you for your letter of March 5, 1997 in which you request a clarification of\nthe definition of the characteristic of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6) as it pertains to\naerosol cans.\nOver the past several years we have received numerous questions concerning the\nregulatory status of used aerosol cans under the Resource Conservation and Recovery\nAct (RCRA) hazardous waste regulations. We are not at this time able to make a\ncategorical determination as to whether various types of cans that may have contained a\nwide range of products exhibit the characteristic of reactivity. It remains the\nresponsibility of the generator of any particular waste to make this determination (see\n40 CFR 262.11). However, a steel aerosol can that does not contain a significant amount\nof liquid (e.g., a can that has been punctured and drained) would meet the definition of\nscrap metal (40 CFR 261.1(c)(6)), and, if it is to be recycled, would be exempt from\nregulation under 40 CFR 261.6 (a)(3)(iv). Scrap metal that is recycled is exempt from\nRCRA regulation under this provision even if it is hazardous waste, so generators need\nnot make a hazardous waste determination. Scrap metal that is not recycled, however,\nis subject to the hazardous waste regulations if it is hazardous, so generators must make\na hazardous waste determination.\nI hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions,\nplease call Anna Tschursin of my staff at (703) 308-8805.\nSincerely yours,\nElizabeth A.

Bergeson\nWeinberg, Sergeson, and Neuman\n1300 Eye Street, N.W.\nSuite 1000 West\nWashington, D.C. 20005\nDear Ms. Bergeson:\nThank you for your letter of October 14, 1994 requesting clarification of the regulatory\nrequirements under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) applicable to the collection,\ntransportation and recycling of spent antifreeze generated at automobile service centers, in particular, at\nwhat point spent antifreeze becomes a solid waste.\nThis request was posed in order in the context of a spent antifreeze recycling program, wherein\nspent antifreeze generated from radiator flushes done at automobile service centers (specifically,\nValvoline Instant Oil Change stores) is collected, stored and sent for recycling at Union Carbide's\nGlycol Recovery Unit in Institute, West Virginia. The specific questions you raised relate to the\npractical difficulties of generating and characterizing spent antifreeze, where one radiator flush may be\nhazardous and the next flush nonhazardous. Please forgive the delay in responding to your request.\nThe following discussion of the RCRA regulations applicable to the spent antifreeze recycling\nprogram that your clients, Union Carbide Corporation and Ecogard, Inc., plan to establish comes after\ncareful consideration of this recycling program and extensive phone conversations between Tom\nOvenden and my staff.\nAt this time, EPA has not determined what point of generation will be applied to \"like wastes\"\n(wastes of a similar composition) through any future Agency rulemakings. As you know, the Agency\nhas solicited comment in its Land Disposal Restriction (LDR) Phase III proposed rule on different\noptions to designating the point of generation for like-wastes. See 60 FR 11702, 11715-11717\n(March 2, 1995). The three specific options presented in the preamble would view the collection of\nmany streams as a single waste for purposes of identifying a point of generation.\nFaxBack # 14003\n\nAs an alternative to designating a point of collection of many streams, the Agency could\nestablish a point of generation for like-wastes upstream of the collection point of like-wastes (e.g., an\nautomotive radiator in the case of spent anti-freeze). However, at least with respect to anti-freeze, we\nare not certain that this represents the most practical way to approach antifreeze management when\nanti-freeze is routinely aggregated and collected in drums and tanks and the characteristic of the\nantifreeze in those containers is the best indicator of potential environmental risks if the material were\nreleased to the environment.\nGiven the facts of the situation, we also realize that it would be impractical to require each\nindividual radiator flush to be tested for a hazardous characteristic. We also realize that assuming that\neach radiator flush is characteristically hazardous may limit the volume of spent antifreeze that\nautomobile service centers will store and this make available for recycling and, ultimately, may impact on\nthe cost-effectiveness of the overall spent antifreeze recycling program.\nBearing this in mind, even if the Agency were to determine that the point of generation should be\nat the radiator, we believe that it would be appropriate for a generator to rely on \"knowledge\" of the\nwaste (as per 40 CFR 262.11(c) (2)) based on studies done to characterize the frequency of\n\"hazardous\" spent antifreeze generated (relative to the generation of \"nonhazardous\" spent arrtifreeze), in\norder to characterize the total volume of hazardous waste generated. Study data. may also be used to\ncharacterize the consolidated volume of spent antifreeze. As you cite in your letter, data. collected by\nvarious parties indicate that up to 40 % of the spent antifreeze flushed from radiators may be hazardous,\nprimarily due to lead. Thus, the Agency believes that, absent facility-specific data. to the contrary, it\nwould be appropriate for a spent antifreeze generator to characterize the total consolidated volume of\nspent antifreeze generated as being 40% hazardous and 60%nonhazardous. Note, however, that\nfacility-specific data. gathered by spent antifreeze generators or authorized regulating agencies could\noverride this 40% presumption and show higher or lower percentages of hazardous wastes.\nThis use of \"knowledge\" of the wastestreams, as applied to the total volume of spent antifreeze\ngenerated, would be an appropriate alternative to testing the spent antifreeze. And, just to clarify, this\napproach would be appropriate for determining the volume of hazardous waste generated for the\npurposes of being eligible for special regulatory provisions for small quantity generators.\nWe agree with you that commingling \"40% hazardous\" spent antifreeze with \"60%\nnonhazardous\" spent antifreeze in a common tank or container by the generator prior to the recycling of\nthe spent antifreeze (and the subsequent treatment and disposal of the residues from recycling in\ncompliance with Part 268) would not constitute impermissible dilution under 40 CFR 2683. Given that\nthis mixing would be done to facilitate proper treatment \u2014recycling and subsequent treatment which\ndestroys, removes or immobilizes hazardous constituents before land disposal \u2014the dilution would not\nbe impermissible.\nIn response to your inquiries regarding the application of the dilution prohibition to the burning of\nmetal-bearing wastes and the burning of the still bottom residues of the spent antifreeze recycling\nprocess, the Agency would consider the still bottoms to be newly generated wastes. Assuming that the\n\nstill bottoms were hazardous, they could appropriately be burned for energy recovery in a regulated unit\nprovided that they have sufficient BTU value. Therefore, the Agency would not consider the burning of\nthe metal-bearing/high BTU bottoms to be impermissible dilution.\nAs for your inquiries regarding the applicable notifications and certifications for the purposes of\nthe land disposal restrictions, insofar as the generator mixes hazardous and nonhazardous spent\nantifreeze such that the resultant mixture is no longer hazardous and meets the applicable treatment\nstandards, the generator must comply with the notification and certification requirements of section\n268.9.\nIn summary, 'the Agency were to determine the radiator to be the point of generation for spent\nanti-freeze, we believe that one possible scenario for the spent antifreeze program is where an\nautomobile service center could commingle each individual radiator flush in a tank or container,\nassuming (absent facility-specific data. to the contrary) for the purposes of waste characterization and\nquantity of hazardous waste generated that 40% of the total volume generated in a month is hazardous\n(D008). The generator could also consider the accumulated total volume of spent antifreeze to be\nnonhazardous.\nThe generator would comply with the one-time notification and certification requirements of\nsection 268.9(d). And, because the commingled mixture of the spent antifreeze is no longer hazardous,\nno hazardous waste manifest would be required.\nThe recycler receiving the nonhazardous spent antifreeze would not require a hazardous waste\nstorage permit or be subject to other hazardous waste management requirements for this wastestream.\nThe recycler should characterize any residues from the distillation/recycling of spent anti freeze\nto determine if they are hazardous wastes. If any of the residuals are hazardous, the recycler must\ncomply with the applicable land disposal restrictions requirements of Part 268 (e.g., notification and\ncertification).\nAssuming, as discussed in your letter, that the residues are hazardous metal-bearing/high BTU\nwastes, these residues may be transported (with a hazardous waste manifest, and land disposal\nrestrictions notification) to a permitted hazardous waste combustion unit for treatment. The final\ntreatment facility would certify compliance with the applicable treatment standards prior to disposal of\nthe residues. You should note, however, that this would be pursuant to the Federal regulatory program.\nAs you know, States that are authorized for RCRA program may have more stringent requirements.\n\nThank you for your interest in the development of a recycling program to manage a common,\nand somewhat problematic, wastestream in an environmentally sound manner.\nSincerely,\nMichael Shapiro, Director\nOffice of Solid Waste\n\nATTACHMENT 27\n\nStrategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA's Regulatory Framework\nSeptember 12, 2016\nI. Introduction\nA. Background\nRegulation of hazardous waste generated by the retail sector under the federal Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act (RCRA) presents unique challenges that are not found in more \"traditional\" RCRA- regulated\nindustries. The retail sector as a whole handles a very large number of diverse products', which change over time\nand may, in many instances, become regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA when discarded 2. As a result,\nretailers are required to make hazardous waste deternvnations for a variety of products at stores located across the\ncountry.\nAdditionally, the reverse distribution 3 process where retail stores generally send unused goods to reverse logistics\ncenters and rely upon arrangements with suppliers/vendors 4 to determine the ultimate disposition of these goods is\nawell-established business practice in the retail sector. Nevertheless, how the reverse distrbution processes is\nregulated, or should be regulated, under RCRA has resulted in a number of questions from both retailers and\nregulators. This issue becomes more complicated for retail chains with store locations in many different states,\nwhere states have taken various positions on how RCRA regulations apply.\nIn 2008, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) began a review of how RCRA hazardous\nwaste regulations apply to the retail sector in order to better understand challenges in complying with RCRA\nregulations. EPA's review consisted of discussions with various members of the retail community and states\nthrough meetings, conferences and site visits.\nOn January 11, 2011, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO)13563 regarding the retrospective review of\nregulations, which required federal agencies such as EPA to develop a plan to \"...determine whether any such\nregulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed so as to make the agency's regulatory\nprogram more effective or less burdensome in achieving the regulatory objectives.\"\nEPA published a Notice of Data Availability (NODA) for the Retail Sector, dated February 14, 2014 (79 FR\n8926) as part of the Agency's continuing efforts to better understand concerns from all stakeholders regarding\nRCRA's applicability to the retail sector, as well as to obtain information and feedback on issues affecting the\nretail sector. The NODA was also intended to satisfy EPA's corrunitment under this EO to solicit public comment\non issues associated with the retail sector. Additional information regarding the NODA is presented in Section\nII.A.\n1 Although the terms \"products\"and\"goods\" are used and generally described at times as \"items\"or \"materials\" in this document, use of\nthese terms is not intended to indicate if or when such items/materials become wastes either at the store or during the reverse distribution\nprocess.\n2 The term discarded is defined at 40 CFR 261.2(a)(2). When a material, such as a retail item, is discarded is a key question because, once\na decision to discard is made, the material becomes a solid waste and the person making this decision is a generator of solid waste. At\nsuch point and time, the generator would be required to make a hazardous waste determination.\n3 EPA is aware that the term \"reverse distribution\" is often used for pharmaceuticals, whereas \"reverse logistics\" is used for non-\npharmaceuticals); however, the former term appears throughout this document and is intended to apply to all retail items under this\nprocess.\n^ The terms \"supplier\"and \"vendor\" (latter more commonly used in the retail industry) appearmore often in this document, as compared\nto\"manufacturer,\" since it is more likely the flow ofgoods/products occurs between retailers and suppliers/vendors (or agents thereof,\nalthough suppliers themselves may also be manufacturers or product formulators.\n\nEPA's ongoing outreach efforts, combined with the comments received on the NODA, have improved the\nAgency's understanding of the challenges arising when managing unused/intact consumer goods that have\nbecome unsalable at retail stores and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\nB. Objective\nEPA's considerable engagement with the retail sector and regulators to date has resulted in development of this\nstrategy, which lays out a cohesive plan to address the unique challenges faced by the retail sector in complying\nwith RCRA regulations while reducing burden and protecting human health and the environment.\nIn crafting this strategy, EPA recognizes that RCRA regulations, which were developed primarily for\nmanufacturing settings, are not necessarily the best fit for the retail sector. EPA is also aware that the Agency has,\nin the past, made efforts to tailor RCRA regulations to address certain types of unique waste management\ncircumstances (e.g., used oil, universal wastes, spent lead-acid batteries, academic laboratory waste).\nEPA further recognizes that there are occasions when unused/inta.ct consumer goods, including customer returns,\ncannot be sold by the original retailer for a variety of reasons such as mandatory or voluntary recalls, seasonal\nchanges, overstock and expired shelf-life.\nFinally, the Agency is taking into account retail sector practices already in place, such as the reverse distrbution\nprocess, to promote sustainability by ensuring that retail items remain marketable as commodities for donation or\nliquidations, thus reducing the amount of waste generated and encouraging recycling of wastes that are generated,\nas opposed to being disposed as solid or hazardous waste. b\nWith this in mind, our strategy consists of athree-pronged approach, which is further discussed in Sections III and\nIV of this document:\n1. Issue Agency policy, guidance and rulemaking to ensure a better fit between RCRA regulations and the retail\nsector.\n2. Research retail hazardous waste management practices and related issues in the area of reverse distrbution,\nuniversal waste and other challenges.\n3. Using the results of our evaluation and research, identify additional approaches to address outstanding RCRA\nretail sector issues if needed.\nII. Identification ofRetail Sector Issues\nA. Retail NODA\nThe objectives of the 2014 Retail NODA were to share information EPA had collected and, more importantly, to\nobtain additional information that would allow the Agency to better understand and address issues encountered by\nindustry and regulators with respect to the application of RCRA regulations, guidance and policy to the retail\nsector.\nIn the NODA, EPA requested comment on a series of topics related to retail operations, waste management\npractices and management of materials that may become hazardous waste when discarded. This specifically\nincluded requests for information regarding aerosol cans (e.g., quantity generated, classification and management\n5 The term \"liquidation\" (also known as salvage) is used in this document to describe sale of products on the secondary market for use by\nconsumers.\nRoutine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials, as well as the occurrence of damaged/leaking products no longer\nconsidered commodities and \"unknowns\"(item contents cannot be identified), also result in waste generation.\n2\n\noptions, including handling as universal waste), since aerosol cans comprise a large percentage of the retail\nsector's hazardous waste stream. The NODA comment period closed on May 30, 2014.\nEPA received comments from 44 stakeholders, with comments consisting of feedback from: (1) companies\nconsisting primarily of retailers [nine commenters]; (2) industry/trade Associations [nine commenters]; (3)\ngovernment and related organizations [seven commenters]; (4) recyclers [three commenters]; (5) waste\nmanagement and treatment, storage and disposal facilities [three commenters]; (6) law firms [three commenters];\n(7) reverse logistics provider [one commenter] and (8) anonymous [nine commenters]. The NODA and supporting\ndocuments, along with comments on the NODA, are available at http://www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/hazardous-\nwaste-management-and-reta il-sector.\nB. Summary of Comments on Retail NODA\nAs part of developing this strategy, EPA has reviewed all NODA comments to identify stakeholder\nissues/concerns, including suggestions on how to better address the retail sector under RCRA. Feedback from\nNODA commenters reinforced EPA's understanding that the retail sector differs from the\nindustriaUmanufacturing sector in the following key respects:\n\u2022 Large number of stores in many locations handling consumer goods that, in many situations, could become\nhazardous waste upon discard\n\u2022 Numerous varieties of goods, which are generally manufactured by someone else and whose ingredients are\noften not fully known, make hazardous waste determinations difficult\n\u2022 Unpredictable quantity of waste generation due to episodic generation (e.g., recalls and customer returns)\n\u2022 Hazardous waste training at the store level is difficult due to high employee turnover\n\u2022 Use of the reverse distribution process to manage unsalable products \u2014including those that become hazardous\nwaste when discarded\nEPA gouped suggestions from NODA commenters into the following major categories (approximate percentage\nof commenters suggesting a particular approach is shown in parentheses)':\n\u2022 Address Pharmaceuticals (42%)\no Remove P-listing for nicotine -containing products (23%)\no Manage as Universal Wastes (17%)\n\u2022 Endorse Reverse Distribution Retail Paradigm \u2014encompasses point of generation and waste determination\nissues (40%)\no Exclude Retail Goods Managed under the Reverse Distribution Process from the Definition of Solid\nWaste (15%)\nExpand Universal Waste Regulations to Other Waste Categories\no Aerosol Cans (35%)\no Pesticides (19%)\no Electronics (17%)\no All Retail GoodsB (14%)\n\u2022 Provide Flexibility for Episodic Generation and Hazardous Waste Quantity Determinations (19%)\n\u2022 Exclude Retail Goods as Household Hazardous Waste/Expand \"Household Hazardous Waste\" Exemption\n(10%)\n\u2022 Revise and Update Satellite Accumulation Area Requirements (9%)\nEPA identified the following additional NODA commenter suggestions that did not fall into major categories:\n~ Universal waste percentages include instances where certain items (pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics) were\nidentified individually and where retail goods as a whole were mentioned.\n8 Assumed to include, but would not necessarily be limited to, pharmaceuticals, aerosol cans, pesticides and electronics.\n\n\u2022 Determine the actual extent of the retail sector \"universe\" in terms of the numbers of retailers, types of retail\nitems handled and amount of wastes generated, as well accurately designating generator categories (i.e., la.rge\nquantity, small quantity and conditionally exempt small quantity generators).\n\u2022 Coordinate with other federal agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation and Food and Drug\nAdministration) when issuing guidance/policy or developing regulations that may affect management of\nmaterials/wastes in the retail sector in order to avoid unnecessary conflicts or duplication of effort.\n\u2022 Clarify the Agency's position regarding whether aerosol cans are considered a reactive hazardous waste.\nConduct outreach activities such as identifying/providing opportunities for training and offering compliance\nassistance.\n\u2022 Support use of e-Manifest and other electronic means of documenting compliance with RCRA regulations.\n\u2022 Recog~vze challenges associated with waste management under differing state regulations.\n\u2022 Eliminate the requirement for large quantity generators to store ignitable or reactive waste at least fifty feet\nfrom the facility's properly line.\nTo the extent they are not already being addressed through policy, guidance and rulemaking or other EPA actions,\nthe Agency will consider the aforementioned issues as part of implementing this strategy.\nIII. Response to Household Hazardous Waste Exemption NODA Comments\nSome NODA commenters suggested that EPA expand the \"household hazardous waste\" exclusion at 40 CFR\n261.4(b)(1) to include either retail goods as a whole or certain types of retail goods. The Agency has already\naddressed this issue as part of a previous rulemaking that responded, in part, to a petition from the American\nRetail Federation (ARF).\nAs explained in a final November 13, 1984 rule (49 FR 44978), EPA excluded household hazardous waste\nbecause the legislative history of RCRA indicated an intent to exclude such wastes and not because these wastes\ncan never pose the risks associated with hazardous wastes. Additionally, consistent with legislative history, EPA\ndetermined that it was necessary to establish two criteria that must be met to qualify for this exclusion when\nevaluating ARF's petition. First, the waste must be generated by individuals on the premises of a temporary or\npermanent residence and, second, the waste stream must be composed primarily of materials found in wastes\ngenerated by consumers in their homes. In this final rule, EPA denied ARF's petition to exempt consumer\nhousehold products from retail sources because these wastes fail to meet both criteria. EPA continues to believe\nthat retail goods, including those that could become wastes when discarded, do not satisfy the criteria for this\nexclusion.\nIV. Current EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nPrior to issuing the NODA in 2014, EPA had already begun developing the Pharmaceuticals rule (staring in 2009)\nand the Generator Improvements rule (starting in 2011), as well as the Definition of Solid Waste (DSW) rule.\nBecause pharmaceutical hazardous waste is a large part of the retail sector's RCRA concerns, EPA mentioned in\nthe NODA that the Agency was developing a proposed rule for healthcare facility-specific management standards\nfor hazardous waste pharmaceuticals (the Pharmaceuticals rule).\nAlthough, for the most part, it was not possible to address all the feedback received on the NODA in these\nrulemakings, EPA has tried to incorporate approaches in these rulemakings to address some of the NODA\ncomments in order to ease the burden of managing hazardous wastes in a retail setting. A discussion of these\nefforts is provided below:\nA. DSW Rule\nThe final DSW rule, dated January 13, 2015 (80 FR 1694), provides new conditional exclusions for hazardous\nsecondary materials. If these materials are managed according to specified conditions, legitimately recycled and\nsent to a verified recycler, they would not be regulated as a solid waste. Retailers may be able to use tivs\n4\n\nexclusion for recycling aerosol cans and possibly other retail items. Additional information on this final\nrulemaking is available at httpJ/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/final-rule-201.5-definition-solid-waste-dsw.\nEPA is coordinating with stakeholders and conducting outreach activities in order to implement and monitor\neffectiveness ofthe final DSW rule.\nB. Ge ne rator Improve ments Rule\nThe proposed Generator Improvements rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 57018), advances approaches for\naddressing a number of issues facing the hazardous waste generator community, including the following issues\nrelevant to the retail sector:\n\u2022 Provides flexibility for episodic generators of hazardous waste.\n\u2022 Allows consolidation of conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste at large quantity generators.\n\u2022 Permits waiver of the 50-foot buffer requirement for ignitable/reactive wastes under certain conditions.\nEPA plans to finalize this rule in fall 2016. Additional information on this rule is available at\nhttpl/www. epa. gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-hazardous-waste-generator-improvements.\nC. Pharmaceuticals Rule\nThe proposed Pharmaceuticals rule, dated September 25, 2015 (80 FR 58014), addresses a number of retailer\nRCRA concerns. The proposed rule:\n\u2022 Advances an approach so that a healthcare facility, including a retailer with a pharmacy, who generates 1 kg\nof acute P-listed hazardous waste pharmaceuticals in a calendar month will not become the most stringently\nregulated generator (a large quantity generator).\n\u2022 Sets forth a tailored set of management standards specifically designed to reduce the complexity and\nregulatory burden of the RCRA hazardous waste regulations for the management of hazardous waste\npharmaceuticals by health care facilities, including hospitals, clinics and retail stores with pharmacies.\n\u2022 Provides regulatory clarity on how the reverse distrbution of pharmaceuticals is regulated under RCRA.\n\u2022 Explores two possible approaches in the rule to address concerns with designating nicotine -containing\nsmoking cessation products (e.g., gums, lozenges and patches) and other low-concentration nicotine-\ncontaining products as acutely hazardous (P-listed) wastes. For both approaches, EPA requested toacicity data.\nfor nicotine (P075). The two regulatory options are: (1) a narrow exemption from the P075 listing for Food\nand Drug Administration -approved over-the-counter smoking cessation products (patches, gums, and\nlozenges) and (2) broader, concentration -based approach to listing nicotine (P-listing for high concentrations\nand U-listing for low concentrations, similar to the approach taken for warfarin.\n\u2022 Requests comment in the rule preamble on whether e-cigarettes and nicotine -containing liquids for e-\ncigarettes should be included within the scope of the definition of pharmaceutical and therefore managed as\nother hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under the pharmaceuticals rule.\nAdditional information on this rule is available at httpl/www.epa.gov/hwgenerators/proposed-rule-management-\nstandards-hazy rdous-waste-pharmaceuticals.\nBeyond the pharmaceuticals proposed rule, EPA has issued guidance to provide regulatory clarity regarding the\nfollowing issues:\n5\n\n\u2022 In letters dated May 8, 2015, EPA issued separate guidance clarifying that: (1) e-cigarettes are P075 waste\ndue to the attached cartridges of nicotine (RCRA Online 14850) and (2) nicotine patches, gums, lozenges and\ne-cigarettes are not solid or hazardous waste when sent for nicotine reclamation (RCRA Online 14851).\n\u2022 In a letter dated October 2, 2015, EPA also issued guidance clarifying that pharmaceutical controlled\nsubstances from households can be accepted at Drug Enforcement Agency -authorized collection receptacles,\nincluding those established at retail stores with pharmacies (RCRA Online 14853).\nV. Upcoming EPA Activities to Address Retail RCRA Issues\nEPA is currently focusing the Agency's near-term efforts on finalizing the Pharmaceuticals and Generator\nImprovements rules. However, we will be undertaking a number of upcoming activities that will also address the\nRCRA concerns of the retail sector and other stakeholders.\nPrimarily, these activities include issuing a guide to recycling aerosol cans, proposing to add aerosol cans to the\nfederal universal waste rules, and developing a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail\nsector as a whole.\nTo date, EPA has gathered useful information regarding management of consumer goods in the retail sector and\nthe associated issues encountered during this process. The Agency's strategy calls for continued engagement\nwith the retail sector and other stakeholders, such as industry representatives and state/tribaUlocal governments, to\nsupport our efforts in moving forward to address the reverse distribution process and universal waste\nmanagement. As necessary, in order to inform future EPA decisions, this outreach/coordination process is\nexpected to involve attending meetings/conferences, conducting site visits and participating in work groups.\nUpcoming activities are discussed in more detail below.\nA. Guide to Recycling Aerosol Cans\nEPA is developing a guide on how to recycle aerosol cans under the existing Subtitle C recycling exclusions,\nincluding recyling aerosol cans for scrap metal recovery. EPA anticipates that this guide will assist generators of\naerosol cans and recyclers to increase their recycling of this ubiquitous waste stream.\nB. Role ofUniversal Waste Regulations\nEPA has been exploring the potential for adding certain retail items, such as aerosol cans, pesticides, and/or\nelectronics, to the federal universal waste regulations by conducting the following activities:\n\u2022 Obtain additional information regarding state programs currently in place to manage aerosol cans (e.g.,\nCalifornia and Colorado) and electronics (e.g., Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Louisiana,\nMichigan, Nebraska and New Jersey) as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Identify and consult with states that are considering including aerosol cans, electronics or other types of items\nas categories of universal waste.\n\u2022 Determine the extent to which states regulate other retail items, including pesticides beyond those recalled, as\nin suspended or cancelled, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as universal wastes.\n\u2022 Evaluate information received from states, including any advantages/disadvantages and challenges associated\nwith management of retail items as universal wastes.\n9 Additional information regarding EPA's key observations and particular examples of stakeholder outreach efforts to date is provided in\nthe Appendixto this strategy.\nG~\n\nIn addition to aforementioned, EPA considers a number of factors, as set forth in federal RCRA regulations, when\ndetermining whether a hazardous waste or category of hazardous waste should be included as universal wastes.'o\nTaking into account feedback from NODA commenters and other information obtained to date, EPA believes that\naerosol cans are 1~7cely to be good candidates for management under federal universal waste regulations.\nTherefore, the Agency is moving forward with plans to develop a proposed rule to address aerosol cans as\nuniversal waste.\nC. Policy on Reverse Distribution and RCRA\nEPA recognizes that, although there are areas within the program that work well, RCRA regulations may not\nalways be the best frt for the retail sector. This has come to light in terms of the reverse distribution process used\nin the retail sector, particular as relates to when discard occurs or is intended to occur and the timing of waste\ndeterminations.\nTherefore, EPA intends to develop a policy that addresses the reverse distribution process for the retail sector as a\nwhole. In doing so, EPA is working from the Agency's understanding regarding the \"flow\" of consumer goods\namong different entities, as well as the roles/relationships of retailers, suppliers/vendors, reverse logistics centers\nand others with respect to unused intact consumer goods that have become unsalable at retail stores for a variety\nof reasons and are moving through the reverse distribution system.\" Unsalable retail items include excess\ninventory, such as expired or outdated items, seasonal items, overstock, recalled (volunta.ry or involuntary)\nproducts and returned items.\nIn developing this policy, EPA will take into account key observations made to date (see appendix), with a\nparticular focus on the nature/extent and significance of challenges encountered when managing consumer goods\nin the retail sector, by considering the following issues:\n\u2022 Scope of the retail \"universe,\" including the number of individually- or family-owned stores\n\u2022 Positions of regulators such as EPA regions, states/tribes and, as necessary, local governments on the location\nof the point of generation\n\u2022 Extent to which inspections by regulators continue to identify compliance issues in the retail sector, including\nfailure to make hazardous waste determinations\n\u2022 Extent to which the reverse distribution process results in appropriate management of unsalable consumer\ngoods originating from retail stores, such that the percentage of retail items disposed as solid or hazardous\nwaste is reduced to the maximum eactent possible\nThis policy is not intended to address wastes from routine maintenance activities and cleanup of spilled materials,\nas well as damaged/leaking products no longer considered commodities and \"unknowns\" (item contents cannot be\nidentified).\nContact: Questions regarding this strategy should be directed to Drew Launch at lausch.robert@epa.gov or 703-\n603-0721 or Kristin Fitzgerald at fitzgerald.kristin@epa.gov or 703-308-8286.\n10 These factors are discussed at 40 CFR 273.81.\n~ ~ A diagam showing the flow of retail items and relationships among various organizations that manage consumer goods and wastes is\navailable at http://www.epagov/hwgenerators/strategy-addressing-retail-sector-under-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act.\n7\n\nAPPENDIX\nKey Observations to Date\nAs part of developing this strategy, the Agency has been conducting outreach efforts (meetings, conferences, site\nvisits, etc.) with key stakeholders and, based on these efforts, the following is noted in no particular order of\nimportance:\n\u2022 When and where hazardous waste determinations are made (i.e., at the store versus at a reverse logistics\ncenter) varies from retailer to retailer and from product to product \u2014and may also vary with time.\n\u2022 Positions of regulators on the location of the point of generation (when a product becomes a waste) vary and\ninspections of retail stores have identified compliance issues \u2014and inspections are anticipated to occur in the\nfuture.\n\u2022 Certain retail chains use safety data sheet-based scanning systems keyed to universal product codes (UPCs) or\nstock keeping units (SKUs) to assist in making waste determinations at the store; however, smaller retailers\nand individually- or family-owned stores may lack this capability and/or may not be fully aware of RCRA\nobligations.\n\u2022 Information regarding the chemical content of certain manufacturers' products is sometimes made publicly\navailable or, if it is considered confidential business information, may be selectively shared with others in\norder to inform appropriate end-of-life management.\n\u2022 There e~sts software that relies upon proprietary manufacturers' product information to determine\nappropriate disposition of unsalable retail items, although how widely this software is utilized across the retail\nsector is not fully known.\n\u2022 Retailers are using third parties to ensure proper management of products determined to be hazardous waste at\nstore locations, although the extent to which this occurs across the retail sector is uncertain.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers also use an SDS-based UPC/SKU scanning system, although the extent to which\nreverse logistics centers as a whole are taking this approach is uncertain.\n\u2022 Waste determinations typically occur at the reverse logistics centers for some retail goods when it's clear that\nthese items have a high possibility of being donated, liquidated or otherwise recycled.\n\u2022 Certain non-prescription drugs (e.g., hand sanitizers, multi-symptom cold relievers and sore throat medicines)\nand supplements such as vitamins are sent to reverse logistics centers where they are disposed as hazardous\nwaste if, for example, the expiration date has passed.\n\u2022 Protocols or corporate directives are in place that specify how retail stores, reverse logistics centers and\nsuppliers/vendors handle excess inventory, make hazardous waste determinations and decide the ultimate\ndisposition of products, ahhough this seems less l~cely in the case of individually- or family-owned stores.\n\u2022 Contracts or other written agreements exist between a retailer and supplier/vendor that specify how the\nprocess for returning unsalable items and awarding of credit works, as well as the extent to which particular\nproducts are required to be managed a certain way, such as prohibiting donation/Gquidation and requiring\ndisposal as hazardous waste due to \"branding issues\" or other concerns.lz\n1z Since EPA is aware that a large percentage of unsalable retail items are \"returned to the supplier/vendor,\" the ultimate disposition of\nthese items is of interest to the Agency.\n8\n\n\u2022 Credit is provided to retailers for unsalable consumer goods, which have an inherent value in that they remain\npotentially marketable as commodities that could be donated or liquidated, which serves as incentive for\nproper management until such time credit is received. 13\n\u2022 Retailers may also be assuming increased responsibility for management and ultimate disposition of unsalable\nretail items as part of the \"Adjustable Rate Policy\" process (supplier/vendor or agent not involved). `a\n\u2022 Given past experiences or other information, such as agreements between suppliers/vendors and\nretailers, retailers may know beforehand that certain consumer goods will ultimately be disposed as hazardous\nwaste, including products that are returned to ensure receipt of manufacturer/supplier credit.\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers play a key role in the management of consumer goods, performing functions such as\ndata collection, financial reconciliation such as credit verification, recall management, material tracking and\nmaterial disposition (i.e., reuse, recycling or disposal).\n\u2022 Reverse logistics centers may also offer benefits such as increasing the likelihood that consumer goods may\nbe donated or liquidated, due to economies of scale, and ensuring that hazardous waste determinations are\nproperly performed.\n\u2022 The role played by suppliers/vendors in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition, is critical and\nrepresents an area requiring further study.\n\u2022 Suppliers/vendors play a critical role in management of retail products under RCRA, including providing\ncredit to retailers, making hazardous waste determinations and influencing ultimate disposition.\n\u2022 Retail items may be repaired/refurbished for ultimate use by consumers but how often and by whom is\nuncertain.\nCertain unsalable retail items may be returned to the manufacturer for use in preparing products (i.e., blended\ninto existing formulations), although the extent to which this occurs is unknown.\n\u2022 Feedback from state programs thus far indicates that management of items such as aerosol cans and\nelectronics as universal wastes works well.\n\u2022 Recycling of aerosol can propellant for use as fuel and the actual container as scrap metal, appear more\ncommon than recycling of can contents (product).\n13 It does not necessarily follow that these items will ultimately be donated or liquidated since they may become a waste in cases where a\nsupplier/vendor requires disposal or where a reverse logistics center determines that disposal is the only remaining management option.\nla Additional information on the Adjustable Rate Policy and other reimbursement policies for unsalable items can be found in the\npublication entitled, 2008 Joint Industry Unsaleables Management Study: The Real Causes and Actionable Solutions. This publication\nis available at http://www.gmaonline.org/downloads/research-and-reports/CJnsaleablesFINAL091108.pdf.\n0\n\nStakeholder Outreach Efforts\nSince the close of the NODA comment period, EPA has been reaching out to various stakeholders and engaging\nin discussions in order to learn more about challenges associated with RCRA and the retail sector. Some examples\ninclude:\n\u2022 EPA participated in the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RICA) conference during September 29-October\n2, 2014 in Minneapolis, MN, which accorded an opportunity to network with various industry representatives\nregarding the Retail NODA and the Agency's retail initiative.\n\u2022 EPA provided an update regarding the Retail NODA at the annual meeting of the Association of State and\nTerritorial Solid Waste Management Officials on October 30, 2014 in Reston, VA.\n\u2022 On November 20, 2014, EPA met with the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) to learn more about\nWFCA's industry/membership and discuss the Retail NODA and better understand the relevance of Agency's\nretail initiative and retail strategy development on products manufactured by WFCA members.\n\u2022 On January 7, 2015, EPA provided regulatory updates to regions and states including a discussion regarding\nthe status of the Pharmaceuticals Rule, Generator Improvement Rule and Defirrition of Solid Waste Rule, as\nwell as efforts associated with the retail initiative and retail strategy development.\n\u2022 On January 14, 2015, EPA participated in a regulatory roundtable as part of the Council on Safe\nTransportation of Hazardous Articles Quarterly Membership meeting in Arlington, VA.

More information regarding the EHSCP can be found at  www.ehscp.org\n. \n \nEHSCP applauds EPA\u2019s efforts to facilitate collection and sound environmental management of used aerosol cans. We agree that the Universal Waste Rules (UWRs) provide the most appropriate  \nregulatory stru cture for aerosol cans. The telecommunications industry uses products in aerosol cans \nat many remote field locations, the majority of which are very small quantity generator sites. Regulation  as universal waste will allow the industry to collect these from  our many remote locations \nin sufficient quantities to facilitate recycling and other environmentally preferable management options.  \n \n                                                             \n1The EHSCP member companies include AT&T, Bell, CenturyLink, Comcast, Crown Castle, Ericsson, Ledcor Technical Services, Nokia, Rise \nBroadband, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Windstream Communications.  \n2 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n The EHSCP strongly supports the proposed rule in most of its elements. However; we recommend a \nfew changes to increase clarity or effectiveness.  \n \nSize Limits:  \n The preamble to the proposed rule mentions that one state includes a size limit of 24 ounces for aerosol cans to qualify as universal waste then continues \u201cEPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that \nmeet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system. \u201d ( \n83 FR 11660) .   \n \nEHSCP concurs with the EPA that a size limit is arbitrary, u nnecessary, and would detract from the goal \nof the UWRs. Typical aerosol cans range in size from 2 ounces to 32 ounces. The environmental risk from aerosol cans is related to their aggregate contents, not the capacity of each aerosol can. Setting \nan arbitrary size limit would force generators to segregate small aerosol cans for universal waste \nmanagement, and larger aerosol cans for hazardous waste management. This adds unnecessary \nburden that could cause some Very Small Quantity Generators  to not to take a dvantage of the UWRs \nand result in aerosol cans being disposed and not recycled.  \n  \nAerosol Can Definition:  \n \nAt 40 CFR 260.10 and 40 CFR 273.9 EPA proposed to define aerosol can as  \n \n\u201c\u2026 an intact container in which gas under pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material \nthrough a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d   \n \nThere are two ways in which this fails to accurately describe cans commonly referred to as aerosol cans and may in troduce confusion as to what cans may be managed as universal waste.  \n\u2022 Large gas cylinders and associated systems may aerate and dispense a spray, but aren\u2019t aerosol cans. The US Department of Transportation in its definition in 49 CFR 171.8 recognizes \ntwo d esign features that distinguish aerosol cans \u2014they are \u201cnon -refillable\u201d and they \nincorporate a \u201cself -closing release device\u201d. Adding these two characteristics to the definition \nwill distinguish aerosol cans from cylinders.  \n\u2022 Many products commonly referred to  as aerosol cans produce a material that some people \nwould not recognize as a spray or foam. For example, some insecticides produce a stream; \nsome produce a fog. This could result in some aerosols not being recycled under the UWR.  \n \nEHSCP recommends that th e definition of \u201cAerosol can\u201d be modified to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cAerosol can means an intact, non -refillable  container in which gas under pressure is used \nto aerate and dispense  expel  any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam  a \nself-closing release device\u201d.  \n3 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n  \n \nLeaking aerosol cans:  \n In section 273.6(b)(4), th e proposed rule excludes : \n \n\u201cAerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d  \n We question the need to exclude damaged cans  and particularly to exclude cans that show evidence \nof past spillage . This would remove many aerosol cans from management as universal waste and \nwould reduce the  benefits of the rule , both environmental and fina ncial. E xisting  universal waste rule s \nprovide standards for managing damaged or leaking containers  by containing them with in an other  \nintact container. Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment. The c ontainer must be \nclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol can and must lack \nevidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of any \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foresee able conditions \u201d. \n \nPuncturing and draining aerosol cans:  \n  1. Sections 273.13(e)(3) and 273.33(e)(3)  of the proposed rule broadly refer to hazardous waste  \naerosol cans. Since the rule only applies to hazardous wastes being managed as universal wastes , \nthe reference to hazardous waste could cause confusion.  \n \nWe recommend changing the text to read:  \n \n\u201cA \u2026 handler of universal waste who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following requirements  while puncturing and \ndraining hazardous waste\n universal waste  aerosol cans \u201d  --  \n 2. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iii) and 273.33(e)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule read \u201cEnsure that puncturing of \nthe can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of any component of \n4 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on \na solid, flat surface in a w ell ventilated area\u201d. We suggest two changes to this paragraph.  \n \na. First, t he term \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d is not well defined. Aerosol cans typically \ninclude a non -hazardous compressed gas as a propellant  which could be interpreted to be a \n\u201ccomponent\u201d of the universal waste aerosol can . It would require very sophisticated \nengineering and provide  no environmental benefit to prevent the release of an inert gas. We \nsuggest replacing \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d with the well -defined terms \u201chazardous \nwaste or hazardous w aste constituent\u201d.  This w ill accomplish EPA\u2019s purpose more clearly while \npreventing misinterpretations.  \n \nb. Second,  we understand  it is common practice to manage device s of this sort on spill catchment \npallets consisting of a catchment basin  covered by a metal or plastic grating that supports the \npuncturing device. This practice aids in capturing any incidental leak or spill. We recommend replacing \u201csolid, flat surface\u201d with \u201cstable surface\u201d to allow for such practice.  \n As amended, this paragraph would read : \n \n\u201cEnsure that puncturing of the can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent \nthe release of any component of universal waste\n hazardous waste or hazardo us waste \nconstituent to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment \non a solid, flat  stable  surface in a well ventilated area\u201d  \n  \n3. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v) and 273.33(e)(3)(v) of the proposed rule require that the universal waste \nhandler \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents \nper 40 CFR 262.11.\u201d While we agree on the need for a hazardous waste determination to be made on the contents, requiring it  for th e emptied cans contradicts prior EPA guidance  regarding scrap \nmetal. The proposed rule only allows for puncturing of cans on the condition that the empty punctured aerosol cans be recycled. Existing rules and previous EPA guidance have been clear that a formal hazardous waste determination is not required for scrap metal being recycled under 40 \nCFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii).  (RCRA Online 11782 , 11806 .)   \n We recommend changing the text  to read:  \n \n\u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11 on the \nemptied aerosol can and \nits contents  removed from aerosol cans . Hazardous waste determinations are not needed for \nemptied aerosol cans being managed as scrap metal recycled under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) .\u201d \n 4. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v i) and 273.33(e)(3)(v i) of the proposed rule read \u201cIf the contents are \ndetermined not to be hazardous, the handler may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste regulations\u201d. The phrase \u201cdetermined not to be hazardous \u201d could be ambiguous.   \n \n5 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n We recommend changing the text to read:  \n\u201cIf the contents are determined not to be hazardous  waste , the handler may manage the solid \nwaste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste \nregulati ons\u201d . \n 5. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) of the proposed rule require that a can puncturing process \u201cImmediately transfer the contents from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, \n262.16, or 262.17\u201d. This could be interpreted to imply (although does not explicitly state) that the \ncontainer attached to the puncturing device would be considered an accumulation container, as \nthat is the container that \u201cimmediately\u201d receives the contents. Typical aerosol can puncturing \nsystems consist of a puncturing device and filter  that are mounted to a drum which serves to \nreceive the contents of the punctured can. The drum is an integral part of the punct uring process  \nand is necessary for safe operation . Prior EPA guidance on recycling operations has suggested that \ndevices integral to a recycling process are part of the recycling process and not subject to regulation as waste storage/accumulation devices . Therefore, w e request clarification to confirm \nthat:  \n a. A container installed between the puncturing device and the filter is integral to the puncturing process.  \nb. A container that i s an integral part of the puncturing process is  part of the exempt recycling \nunit and not subject to hazardous waste container requirements . \nc. A container that is part of the exempt recycling unit will retain exempt  status during times \nwhen can puncturing is not actively occurring , the puncturing system is removed  and the \ncontainer remains closed, but will later be returned to aerosol can puncturing service.  \n \nWe suggest changing the language of 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) to read  \n \n\u201cImmediately transfer\n When a universal waste aerosol can is punctured  the contents \nfrom the waste  aerosol can , or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank  must be \nimmediately contained in a device that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, \n262.15, 262.16, or 262.17; or is  an exempt recycling unit. If a container that is part of an \nexempt recycling unit is permanently removed from the recycling unit it must be immediately \nmanaged under the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, or 262.17.\u201d  \n \n \nManaging any aerosol can as  universal waste:  \n In the past, EPA has suggested that solid wastes otherwise meeting the applicability of a universal \nwaste category can be managed as that type of universal waste irrespective of whether they are, in fact, hazardous waste. It is helpful because it allows  all waste aerosol cans to be collected and \nmanaged under a single  program. However, this is not stated anywhere in the UWRs. EHSCP suggests \n6 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n that EPA take this opportunity to add that allowance explicitly in the rules . This could be accomplished \nby amendin g \u00a7273.8(a) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Persons managing the wastes listed below may, at their option, manage them under the \nrequirements of this part:  \n \n(1) Household wastes that are exempt under \u00a7261.4(b)(1) of this chapter and are also of the same type as the univ ersal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9; \nand/or  \n (2) Very small quantity generator wastes that are exempt under \u00a7262.14 of this chapter and are also of the same type as the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9 .\n; and/or  \n \n(3) Solid wastes not meeting the definition of hazardous waste that are  also of the same type \nas the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9.\"  \n \n On behalf of the EHSCP member companies, thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this proposed rule. Please contact me if you need additional information or would like to discuss \nour comments further.  \n Sincerely,  \n \nBryan Stolte  \nChair - Environmental, Health & Safety Communications Panel  \nTel: ( 405)202 -2074  \n \n\n"

Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment. The c ontainer must be \nclosed, structurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol can and must lack \nevidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage or releases of any \nhazardous constituents to the environment under reasonably foresee able conditions \u201d. \n \nPuncturing and draining aerosol cans:  \n  1. Sections 273.13(e)(3) and 273.33(e)(3)  of the proposed rule broadly refer to hazardous waste  \naerosol cans. Since the rule only applies to hazardous wastes being managed as universal wastes , \nthe reference to hazardous waste could cause confusion.  \n \nWe recommend changing the text to read:  \n \n\u201cA \u2026 handler of universal waste who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following requirements  while puncturing and \ndraining hazardous waste\n universal waste  aerosol cans \u201d  --  \n 2. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iii) and 273.33(e)(3)(iii) of the proposed rule read \u201cEnsure that puncturing of \nthe can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent the release of any component of \n4 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n universal waste to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on \na solid, flat surface in a w ell ventilated area\u201d. We suggest two changes to this paragraph.  \n \na. First, t he term \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d is not well defined. Aerosol cans typically \ninclude a non -hazardous compressed gas as a propellant  which could be interpreted to be a \n\u201ccomponent\u201d of the universal waste aerosol can . It would require very sophisticated \nengineering and provide  no environmental benefit to prevent the release of an inert gas. We \nsuggest replacing \u201ccomponent of universal waste\u201d with the well -defined terms \u201chazardous \nwaste or hazardous w aste constituent\u201d.  This w ill accomplish EPA\u2019s purpose more clearly while \npreventing misinterpretations.  \n \nb. Second,  we understand  it is common practice to manage device s of this sort on spill catchment \npallets consisting of a catchment basin  covered by a metal or plastic grating that supports the \npuncturing device. This practice aids in capturing any incidental leak or spill. We recommend replacing \u201csolid, flat surface\u201d with \u201cstable surface\u201d to allow for such practice.  \n As amended, this paragraph would read : \n \n\u201cEnsure that puncturing of the can is in a manner designed to prevent fires and to prevent \nthe release of any component of universal waste\n hazardous waste or hazardo us waste \nconstituent to the environment. This includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment \non a solid, flat  stable  surface in a well ventilated area\u201d  \n  \n3. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v) and 273.33(e)(3)(v) of the proposed rule require that the universal waste \nhandler \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents \nper 40 CFR 262.11.\u201d While we agree on the need for a hazardous waste determination to be made on the contents, requiring it  for th e emptied cans contradicts prior EPA guidance  regarding scrap \nmetal. The proposed rule only allows for puncturing of cans on the condition that the empty punctured aerosol cans be recycled. Existing rules and previous EPA guidance have been clear that a formal hazardous waste determination is not required for scrap metal being recycled under 40 \nCFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii).  (RCRA Online 11782 , 11806 .)   \n We recommend changing the text  to read:  \n \n\u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11 on the \nemptied aerosol can and \nits contents  removed from aerosol cans . Hazardous waste determinations are not needed for \nemptied aerosol cans being managed as scrap metal recycled under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii) .\u201d \n 4. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(v i) and 273.33(e)(3)(v i) of the proposed rule read \u201cIf the contents are \ndetermined not to be hazardous, the handler may manage the waste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste regulations\u201d. The phrase \u201cdetermined not to be hazardous \u201d could be ambiguous.   \n \n5 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n We recommend changing the text to read:  \n\u201cIf the contents are determined not to be hazardous  waste , the handler may manage the solid \nwaste in any way that is in compliance with applicable federal, state or local solid waste \nregulati ons\u201d . \n 5. Sections 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) of the proposed rule require that a can puncturing process \u201cImmediately transfer the contents from the waste aerosol can, or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, \n262.16, or 262.17\u201d. This could be interpreted to imply (although does not explicitly state) that the \ncontainer attached to the puncturing device would be considered an accumulation container, as \nthat is the container that \u201cimmediately\u201d receives the contents. Typical aerosol can puncturing \nsystems consist of a puncturing device and filter  that are mounted to a drum which serves to \nreceive the contents of the punctured can. The drum is an integral part of the punct uring process  \nand is necessary for safe operation . Prior EPA guidance on recycling operations has suggested that \ndevices integral to a recycling process are part of the recycling process and not subject to regulation as waste storage/accumulation devices . Therefore, w e request clarification to confirm \nthat:  \n a. A container installed between the puncturing device and the filter is integral to the puncturing process.  \nb. A container that i s an integral part of the puncturing process is  part of the exempt recycling \nunit and not subject to hazardous waste container requirements . \nc. A container that is part of the exempt recycling unit will retain exempt  status during times \nwhen can puncturing is not actively occurring , the puncturing system is removed  and the \ncontainer remains closed, but will later be returned to aerosol can puncturing service.  \n \nWe suggest changing the language of 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 273.33(e)(3)(iv) to read  \n \n\u201cImmediately transfer\n When a universal waste aerosol can is punctured  the contents \nfrom the waste  aerosol can , or puncturing device if applicable, to a container or tank  must be \nimmediately contained in a device that meets the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, \n262.15, 262.16, or 262.17; or is  an exempt recycling unit. If a container that is part of an \nexempt recycling unit is permanently removed from the recycling unit it must be immediately \nmanaged under the applicable requirements of \u00a7 262.14, 262.15, 262.16, or 262.17.\u201d  \n \n \nManaging any aerosol can as  universal waste:  \n In the past, EPA has suggested that solid wastes otherwise meeting the applicability of a universal \nwaste category can be managed as that type of universal waste irrespective of whether they are, in fact, hazardous waste. It is helpful because it allows  all waste aerosol cans to be collected and \nmanaged under a single  program. However, this is not stated anywhere in the UWRs. EHSCP suggests \n6 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n that EPA take this opportunity to add that allowance explicitly in the rules . This could be accomplished \nby amendin g \u00a7273.8(a) as follows:  \n \n\u201c(a) Persons managing the wastes listed below may, at their option, manage them under the \nrequirements of this part:  \n \n(1) Household wastes that are exempt under \u00a7261.4(b)(1) of this chapter and are also of the same type as the univ ersal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9; \nand/or  \n (2) Very small quantity generator wastes that are exempt under \u00a7262.14 of this chapter and are also of the same type as the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9 .\n; and/or  \n \n(3) Solid wastes not meeting the definition of hazardous waste that are  also of the same type \nas the universal wastes defined at \u00a7273.9.\"  \n \n On behalf of the EHSCP member companies, thank you again for the opportunity to provide comment on this proposed rule.

The EHSCP  strives to provide constructive input to the development and \nimplementation of environmental, health,  and safety standards and guidelines that affect the varied \nbusinesses withi n the communications industry . As such, the panel maintains an active advocacy role, \nproviding comments and recommendations to federal and state agencies where issues concern the \ncommunications industry.  More information regarding the EHSCP can be found at  www.ehscp.org\n. \n \nEHSCP applauds EPA\u2019s efforts to facilitate collection and sound environmental management of used aerosol cans. We agree that the Universal Waste Rules (UWRs) provide the most appropriate  \nregulatory stru cture for aerosol cans. The telecommunications industry uses products in aerosol cans \nat many remote field locations, the majority of which are very small quantity generator sites. Regulation  as universal waste will allow the industry to collect these from  our many remote locations \nin sufficient quantities to facilitate recycling and other environmentally preferable management options.  \n \n                                                             \n1The EHSCP member companies include AT&T, Bell, CenturyLink, Comcast, Crown Castle, Ericsson, Ledcor Technical Services, Nokia, Rise \nBroadband, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Windstream Communications.  \n2 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n The EHSCP strongly supports the proposed rule in most of its elements. However; we recommend a \nfew changes to increase clarity or effectiveness.  \n \nSize Limits:  \n The preamble to the proposed rule mentions that one state includes a size limit of 24 ounces for aerosol cans to qualify as universal waste then continues \u201cEPA has not, however, included a size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this proposal because EPA believes that aerosol cans that \nmeet the proposed definition in general can be safely managed under the universal waste system. \u201d ( \n83 FR 11660) .   \n \nEHSCP concurs with the EPA that a size limit is arbitrary, u nnecessary, and would detract from the goal \nof the UWRs. Typical aerosol cans range in size from 2 ounces to 32 ounces. The environmental risk from aerosol cans is related to their aggregate contents, not the capacity of each aerosol can. Setting \nan arbitrary size limit would force generators to segregate small aerosol cans for universal waste \nmanagement, and larger aerosol cans for hazardous waste management. This adds unnecessary \nburden that could cause some Very Small Quantity Generators  to not to take a dvantage of the UWRs \nand result in aerosol cans being disposed and not recycled.  \n  \nAerosol Can Definition:  \n \nAt 40 CFR 260.10 and 40 CFR 273.9 EPA proposed to define aerosol can as  \n \n\u201c\u2026 an intact container in which gas under pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material \nthrough a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d   \n \nThere are two ways in which this fails to accurately describe cans commonly referred to as aerosol cans and may in troduce confusion as to what cans may be managed as universal waste.  \n\u2022 Large gas cylinders and associated systems may aerate and dispense a spray, but aren\u2019t aerosol cans. The US Department of Transportation in its definition in 49 CFR 171.8 recognizes \ntwo d esign features that distinguish aerosol cans \u2014they are \u201cnon -refillable\u201d and they \nincorporate a \u201cself -closing release device\u201d. Adding these two characteristics to the definition \nwill distinguish aerosol cans from cylinders.  \n\u2022 Many products commonly referred to  as aerosol cans produce a material that some people \nwould not recognize as a spray or foam. For example, some insecticides produce a stream; \nsome produce a fog. This could result in some aerosols not being recycled under the UWR.  \n \nEHSCP recommends that th e definition of \u201cAerosol can\u201d be modified to read as follows:  \n \n\u201cAerosol can means an intact, non -refillable  container in which gas under pressure is used \nto aerate and dispense  expel  any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam  a \nself-closing release device\u201d.  \n3 \nEHSCP Re: EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \n  \n \nLeaking aerosol cans:  \n In section 273.6(b)(4), th e proposed rule excludes : \n \n\u201cAerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.\u201d  \n We question the need to exclude damaged cans  and particularly to exclude cans that show evidence \nof past spillage . This would remove many aerosol cans from management as universal waste and \nwould reduce the  benefits of the rule , both environmental and fina ncial. E xisting  universal waste rule s \nprovide standards for managing damaged or leaking containers  by containing them with in an other  \nintact container. Leaking or damaged aerosol cans can  be safely managed in an equivalent manner. \nThe language currently applying to broken universal waste lamps can be easily adapted to provide \nsuch a standard for aerosol cans.  \n EHSCP recommends deleting subsection (b)(4) from \u00a7273.6 and amending both \u00a7273.13(e) and \n\u00a7273.33(e) by renumbering subsection (3) to subsection (4) an d adding a new subsection (3) to read:  \n \n\u201cA [small/large] quantity handler of universal waste must immediately clean up and place in \na container any aerosol can that shows evidence of breakage, leakage, or damage that could \ncause the release of any hazardous constituents to the environment.

However, the handler bears the burden of provi ng that such activity was solely for the purpose of \naccumulation of such quantities of universal waste as necessary to facilitate proper recovery, treatment, or disposal.  \n \nBackground:  \nA large federal facility site has a single RCRA Site ID number and is considered a large quantity handler of universal \nwaste.    \n \nThe site has a centralized building for consolidating universal waste (UW) in preparation for off -site shipment to a \ndestinatio n facility.   The centralized building is also used for aerosol can puncturing.  \n \nThe onsite locations where UW is initially generated and accumulated are geographically spread out.   Most of the \ngeneration/accumulation locations are more than 15 miles away f rom the centralized/consolidation area.   \n   \nAt many generation/accumulation locations, UW is accumulated slowly.   Accordingly, it might take an extended period to \naccumulate enough UW quantities to support economic transfers to the centralized/consolidatio n area.   Onsite UW \ntransfers are made using pickups or tandem axle trucks.  \n \nWhen UW is received at the centralized/consolidation building, additional time may be needed to accumulate sufficient \nquantities to support economic shipments to an off -site destin ation facility.   The off -site shipments are made using heavy \ncommercial material vehicles (capable of hauling 48,000 pounds of cargo).   The off -site shipments are managed so as to \noptimize transport vehicle cargo space.   The travel distance to the off -site destination facility is significant (i.e., over 1000 \nmiles).

The Aerosol Can Universal Waste Rule, published  in the \nFederal Register  on March 16 , 2018 , appear s at 83 Fed. Reg. 11654. \n \nStatement of Interest  \n \nTFI represents the nation\u2019s fertilizer industry, including producers, importers, retailers, \nwholesalers and companies that are engaged in all aspects of the  fertilizer supply chain. Fertilizer \nis a key ingredient in feeding a growing global population, which is expected to surpass 9.5 \nbillion people by 2050. Half of all food grown around the world today is made possible through \nthe use of fertilizer.  \n \nTFI mem bers routinely generate, recycle and dispose of aerosol cans and are included in the two \ndigit North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes 21 (mining), 32 (manufacturing), \nand 42 (fertilizer retail er).  Many times aerosol cans are the sole sourc e of hazardous waste \ngenerated at the manufacturing, mining, or retail facilities. As such, TFI members are impacted \nby the proposed regulatory modifications.  \n \nTFI Comments  \n \nTFI supports  EPA\u2019s proposed rule to manage hazardous waste aerosol cans as univer sal waste to \nfacilitate environmentally sound metal recycling. TFI applauds EPA for recognizing , in the \nDocket ID No. EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017 -0463  \nMay 15, 201 8 \nPage 2 \n \n  proposed rule , that management of aerosol cans as a universal waste will reduce costs while \nmaintaining protection of the environment, prevent ing dispos al at landfills, and promot ing \nrecycling .   \nTFI agrees with the rationale EPA summarized supporting the eight factors that must be \nconsidered for including aerosol cans in the universal waste rule.  As noted in the preamble to the \nproposed rule, no t every factor must be met for a waste to be included in the universal waste rule. \nHowever, TFI asserts that EPA has provided adequate justification to support all eight categories \nand each has been sufficiently  satisfied .   \nEPA has also proposed thorough and systematic management standards for aerosol cans to \naddress ignitability risks, release prevention, and risk mitigation activities necessary to be \ndesignated as universal waste. While TFI generally supports the proposed standards, TFI \nquestions what EP A contemplates for compliance with the requirement that the proposed written \nprocedure for the draining of aerosol cans includes \u201coperation and maintenance of the unit.\u201d 83 \nFed. Reg. at 11 666, 11 667 (proposed 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii) and 273.33(e)(3 )(ii)).   \nIn the preamble  to the Aerosol Can Universal Waste Rule , EPA discusses an Environmental \nTechnology Verificat ion (E TV) program that evaluated the performance of one type of aerosol \nan puncturing device.  Id. at 11 661.

B.As discussed on page 11656, the proposed rule could be interpre ted to preclude a VSQG from sending aerosol spray cans to a LQG  under the control of the same person unless the LQG is a permi tted storage facility. The U. S. Army Corps \nof Engineers has some VSQGs that may benefit from transferring their aerosol spray cans to a LQG generator under the control o f the same person. The proposed rule does not specifically addr ess VSQGs that opt to send their aerosol \nspray cans to a LQG under the control of the same person as all owed under existing 40 CFR 262.14(a)(5)(viii)(A).  However, the  preamble discussion on page 11656 states, \u201cEPA has interpreted  the current hazardous waste regulations to \nmean that puncturing and draining an aerosol can, if performed for the purpose of recycling ( e.g., for scrap metal recycling), is considered part of the recycling  process and is exempt from RCRA permitting requirements under 40 CFR \n261.6(c).6 However, facilities receiving hazardous waste aeroso l cans from off-site would require a RCRA permit for storage pr ior to the recycling activity, and the recycling process would be subject to subparts AA and BB of 40 CFR part \n264, 265, or 267.\u201d Clarify in final rule that rule allowing LQGs to accept hazardo us waste \nfrom offsite VSQGs under the control of the same person without  \ntriggering a storage permit requirement (40 CFR 262.14) also ap plies \nto handlers of universal waste aerosol cans.  \n2Page 1165440 CFR Parts 260, 261, 264, 265, \n268, 270, and 273Army supports finalization of the proposed rule to manage aeros ol cans under the universal waste rule. Because universal waste s can be accumulated for longer time frames, managing aerosol s pray cans as universal waste is expected to \nfacilitate recycling while reducing the cost of hazardous waste  management and remaining protective of human health and the en vironment. Army supports finalization of the Proposed Rule.\n3 11660, 1st column, paragraph 3Concur that the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d should not contain a size limitation provided the item meets the general definitio n requirements. However, certain contents of aerosol cans such as spray adhesives should be disqualified in the \ndefinition since the contents of the aerosol can may impact the  otherwise beneficial recycling of aerosol cans. For example, s pray adhesives when drained may clog puncture equipment renderi ng it inoperable unless another method can be \nused for this specific item.       The Dept. of Defense procure s and uses several aerosol cans that exceed the 24-oz limit as established by the State of Utah. Limiting the size of applicab le aerosol containers may result in duplication of \nrequirements contrary to the stated purpose of the proposed rul e. Rather than restricting container size, EPA may consider restri cting \nthe contents of aerosol cans, such as spray adhesives, that may  not \nbe compatible with the proposed recycling process.\n4Page 11661, end of column III and top of page \n11662EPA requests comment on establishing additional regulatory requ irements for can draining devices and limits on aerosol cans th at may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured an d drained under the proposed rules.\nThe compatibility concern is already addressed in 273.13 (e)(3) (ii) and 273.33(e)(3)(ii) as part of the written procedure requ irement.It may be of benefit to add  for consideration to the UW aerosol can \npuncturing and draining written procedure requirements  EPA\u2019s \npreamble list of potentially incompatible wastes for considerat ion \n\u201c\u2026include[ing], but are not limited to, cans containing the fol lowing \ncontents: Ethers including ethyl ether, chlorinated compounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners and  \nunknowns.\u201d\n5 11660, 2\nnd  column, paragraph 3Text of proposed rule reads; \u201cIn proposed 273.6(b)(3), EPA spec ifically excludes aerosol cans that have been emptied of their contents (both propellant and product). Once the contents of a universal waste aerosol can have been removed, \nthe emptied can is considered a new point of generation and is subject to a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR 262.11.

B.As discussed on page 11656, the proposed rule could be interpre ted to preclude a VSQG from sending aerosol spray cans to a LQG  under the control of the same person unless the LQG is a permi tted storage facility.

A n aerosol can that meets the definition of empty container in 4 0 CFR 261.7 is not subject to hazardous waste \nregulation, and may be recycled as scrapMetal.\u201d  \nThe historical problem with aerosol cans has been determining e xactly when a can is \u201cempty\u201d per the definition at 40 CFR 261.7 .  \nEven though no product may remain in the can when emptied as fu lly as is possible by the generator, a residual amount of prope llant vapor and/or product may still remain that could make the  can fail the ignitability test, and therefore still \nmake it a hazardous waste.  The only real way for an aerosol ca n to be considered truly empty is for it to be punctured and dr ained of all of its contents. At that point, the waste is consi dered scrap metal and not a hazardous waste.  \nEPA should clarify the ambiguity surrounding a generator\u2019s requ irements as to how best to determine if a can is truly \u201cempty.\u201d   40 CFR 261.7 currently states: \n\u201c(b)(1) A container or an inner liner removed from a container that has held any hazardous waste, except a waste that is a com pressed gas or that is identified as an acute hazardous waste l isted in \u00a7\u00a7261.31 or 261.33(e) of this chapter is \nempty if: \n(i) All wastes have been removed that can be removed using the practices commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container, e.g., pouring, pumping, and aspirating, and \n(ii) No more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remain on the bottom of the container or inner liner, or \n(iii)(A) No more than 3 percent by weight of the total capacity  of the container remains in the container or inner liner if th e container is less than or equal to 119 gallons in size.\n(iii)(A) No more than 3 percent by weight of the total capacity  of the container remains in the container or inner liner if th e container is less than or equal to 119 gallons in size.\n(2) A container that has held a hazardous waste that is a compr essed gas is empty when the pressure in the container approache s atmospheric.\u201d\nTesting of each individual aerosol cans for residual contents o r gas pressure would be cost prohibitive and negate the benefit s realized of aerosol cans being classified as Universal Waste.   Request EPA clarify in proposed 40 CFR 273.6, \n\u201cApplicability\u2014Aerosol cans.\u201d that an aerosol can is allowed to  be \ndetermined to be empty under the 40 CFR 271.6 definition (and n o \nlonger classified as hazardous waste) if the can pressure is at  or near \natmospheric, with the following clarification:\n \u201cFor purposes of this rule, aerosol cans are considered \u2018empty \u2019 after \nthe generator has fully depressed the aerosol can\u2019s spray valve , no \nfurther product is discharged, and when the pressure in the con tainer \napproaches atmospheric.  The generator is not required to test or \nmeasure can pressure at that point.  The mere presence of resid ual \npropellant that may remain in what is otherwise considered an e mpty \ncan (i.e., no further product can be discharged) will not class ify the \ncan as hazardous waste.\u201d\n6 11660, 3\nrd column, paragraph 2The proposed rule notes small and large quantity universal wast e handlers may sort aerosol cans by type. \u201c\u2026puncturing and drai ning an aerosol can, if performed as part of the recycling proc ess (e.g., scrap metal recycling), is exempt from \nRCRA permitting requirements per 40 CFR 261.6(c). Storage of ha zardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still requires a permit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provi sion\u201d. The proposed rule should clarify the \npermitting requirement or type of permit required for storage o f hazardous waste aerosol cans as defined in the RCRA permittin g process.  If EPA intends to establish storage quantities or a permitting \nthreshold, this quantity should be defined. The current languag e \ncould mistakenly be inferred for both small quantity handlers o f \nuniversal waste (SQHUWs) / largequantity handlers of universal waste (LQHUWs) and small quantit y \ngenerators (SQGs) / large quantity generators (LQGs).\nConcur with the recommendation to establish separate management  \nstandards for handlers vs generators.\nDoD\u00a0Consolidated\u00a0Comments\nProposed\u00a0Aerosol\u00a0Cans\u00a0Recycling\u00a0Rule\nNumber Page, Para, and Line or Figure Comment Proposed Resolution\n7 11661, 3rd column, last two lines Consideration should also be given to puncturing of spray adhes ive aerosol cans due to compatibility issues with the process e quipment. Spray adhesive may build up and clog the puncturing e quipment.The rule identifies different categories of aerosol cans but do es not \nspecifically identify spray adhesive, which may not follow the same \nprocess as other aerosol containers due to the contents. Other types \nof material may not logistically meet the criteria for Universa l Waste \ndue to the contents. \n8 Page 11662, column IEPA is requesting comment on limiting puncturing and draining p ractices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entiti es in exchange for compensation).\nIf EPA places a limitation on puncturing and draining UW aeroso l cans by commercial processors, then EPA should include a defi nition for \u201ccommercial processor\u201d in the regulatory text.\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) UW handlers of aerosol cans would l ike the ability to accumulate, puncture and drain UW aerosol ca ns generated by other offsite DoD installations and commands; t herefore, it would help clarify any limitation \nplaced on UW aerosol can commercial processors if the term was defined in the regulatory text.Define commercial processors (for example, Commercial Processor s \nof aerosol cans means entities that charge a fee and accept was tes \nfrom the general public).  \n9 Page 11666, 40 CFR 273.9 Definitions Word UW Handler definition  per EPA waste management hierarchy to allow handlers to conduc t battery and aerosol can activities described in 40 CFR 273, w hether the activity is considered recycling, treatment, or disp osal.Reword definition as follows: \n\u201cUniversal Waste Handler:\n* * * * *\n(b) Does not mean:  (1) A person who recycles, treats, or dispo ses of \nuniversal waste, except under the provisions of 40 CFR 273.13(a ) or \n(c ), 40 CFR 273.33(a) or (c ), 40 CFR 273.13(e ), or 40 CFR 273.33(e ); or\n10Page 11666, 40 CFR 273.13 and page 11667, \n40 CFR 273.33, Waste ManagementUW aerosol can puncturing and draining activities lend themselv es to a regulatory structure similar to battery management acti vities and could be written in parallel manner for greater clar ity.        \n Ideally, universal waste punctured and drained aerosol cans wi ll be eligible for recycling under 40 CFR 261.4 scrap metal exc lusion or as a solid waste.Waste management activities could be written in sequence as \nfollows:  \u201c(3) A small quantity handler of universal waste who \npunctures and drains their\n hazardous waste  aerosol cans must \nrecycle the empty punctured aerosol cans and meet the following \nrequirements while puncturing and draining hazardous waste aero sol \ncans : * * *(v) Recycle the empty punctured aerosol cans;(vi)  Conduct \na hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its \ncontents and any other solid waste generated as a result of the  \npuncturing activities per 40 CFR 262.11. Any hazardous waste \ngenerated as a result of puncturing and draining the aerosol ca n is \nsubject to all applicable requirements of 40 CFR parts 260 thro ugh \n272. The handler is considered the generator of the hazardous w aste \nand is subject to 40 CFR part 262;\u201d      \n Renumber remaining proposed paragraphs (vi) and (viii), \naccordingly.         \n  Revise 40 CFR 237.33 for Large quantity handlers in an identi cal \nsimilar manner. \n11 Page 11662, column IEPA is requesting comment on limiting puncturing and draining p ractices to handlers that are not commercial processors (i.e., do not charge a fee to accept wastes) unless the commercial pro cessor meets the requirements for a universal \nwaste destination facility (including requiring a permit for st orage of the hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling).         \nHandlers that are commercial processors should be allowed to pu ncture and drain aerosol cans under the same regulatory standar ds as apply to other universal waste handlers, except that the granting of extended accumulation time may not \nbe appropriate for commercial processors.            \n The current nationwide situation - where many localities lack convenient solutions for managed disposal of household hazardou s wastes - only encourages these wastes to be intermingled and disposed with other municipal solid waste.  This \nlack of convenient options for households (and small businesses ) has been the norm for far too long and essentially represents  a national failing in the management of many common waste type s that would be better managed outside of the \nmunicipal solid waste stream.  EPA should prioritize reducing b arriers to the development of appropriate locally available opt ions for disposal of common waste types, such as aerosol cans.                      \nThe relatively low value of metal available through recycling i tems like aerosol cans, in comparison to the associated costs, means the some subsidy or a charge for disposal is required to support these types of can recycling operations.           \nEPA\u2019s preamble does not offer an explanation of why a commercia l processor is not as well positioned to safely puncture and dr ain aerosol cans as other universal waste handlers, or generato rs would be.  In 40 CFR 273.33, handlers of \nuniversal waste batteries are allowed to drain and disassemble batteries, and then (as if they are newly generating wastes) ma ke a determination of whether any resulting wastes exhibit a ha zardous waste characteristic.  It would seem \nconsistent to allow commercial processor handlers of universal waste aerosol cans to be a point of generation of wastes create d by puncturing and draining contents and recycling the metal o f aerosol cans.                                \n Requiring commercial processors to obtain a RCRA Part B permit  to puncture and drain aerosol cans would add a substantial add itional administrative burden and associated costs, which would  either result in increased fees for \nmanagement of these waste types or, for many commercial process ors, may result in a decision to stop accepting these waste typ es.  These outcomes would be contrary to EPA\u2019s stated goals of increasing recycling and reducing disposal of \naerosol cans in waste destined for municipal solid waste facili ties.Allow commercial processors that accept aerosol cans to punctur e \nand drain them under the same regulatory requirements as would apply to any other universal waste handlers of aerosol cans.\n"

    "comment_text": "Note: I am a student at Duke University studying environmental science, and I'm writing this comment as an assignment for a class on environmental policy.\n\nThe use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers and the public due to their flammability, pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety Management Group, 2013). They are also demonstrably harmful to public health and the environment due to their effects on the atmosphere and the leaching of harmful chemicals from cans disposed in landfills (4 Reasons, n.d.; Carlson et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2015). And although the probability of serious injury is relatively low (Yarbrough, 1998), United States manufacturing and automotive facilities alone use more than 1.6 billion aerosol cans annually, so it is important that they be managed responsibly (Avoid Disposing, 2017).\n\nI am in favor of the proposed rule because it will benefit the environment, streamline the disposal process, and decrease the regulatory burden on manufacturers and businesses while saving money and ensuring that hazardous materials are properly managed.\n\nChanging aerosol cans designation from hazardous to universal waste is appropriate and necessary because the specific nature of aerosol cans require unique management strategies to mitigate risks. Currently, the system for managing aerosol cans as hazardous waste is unnecessarily complicated and difficult. Cans are treated differently based on their volume, contents, and the disposal or recycling equipment and programs that exist at any particular location. The system is also inconsistent from place to place, as individual states may have stipulated more rigorous regulatory provisions for aerosol can disposal (Aerosol Can Disposal, 2017). Streamlining the process of waste disposal by adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program will facilitate more standardized management of cans as well as ensure that they are properly dealt with in ways that prevent accidents or injuries and reduce the environmental impact of cans in landfills.\n\nIt has the potential to save businesses money as well. While disposal of hazardous materials can range from $0.79 per pound up to $25.00 per pound for different substances, other forms of universal waste have greater flexibility in pricing due to the more streamlined process of disposal, especially when recycling alternatives are considered (Indiana University, n.d.; EPA, 2016).\n\nOn the production and manufacturing side, a more streamlined process for aerosol can collection and disposal by universal waste handlers may have a large impact on both landfill capacities and environmental concerns through increased recycling programs that are facilitated by simplified and improved waste management (Avoid Disposing, 2017; Bennett, 2014; How to Recycle Aerosol Cans, n.d.).\n\nIn addition, since households are exempt from compliance with RCRA standards for dealing with hazardous waste, adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program may also have a large impact on consumer behavior and individual participation in recycling programs (EPA, n.d.). Many businesses already offer programs that assist homeowners in safely disposing of hazardous waste materials (Household Hazardous Waste Disposal, n.d.), and the addition of aerosol cans to this list may prompt similar accommodations for households in tandem with industrial and commercial compliance with the new regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the approval of the proposed rule as well as its careful implementation and evaluation, particularly in the form of thorough research on the environmental impacts of the processing of waste aerosol cans during the disposal process, as I was unable to find any satisfactory scientific analysis of these topics. I further encourage measures that will incentivize and facilitate increased recycling of waste aerosol cans due to the significant environmental and economic benefits that such an investment would stimulate.\n\nReferences are in the attached file.",

    "combined_text": "Note: I am a student at Duke University studying environmental science, and I'm writing this comment as an assignment for a class on environmental policy.\n\nThe use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers and the public due to their flammability, pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety Management Group, 2013). They are also demonstrably harmful to public health and the environment due to their effects on the atmosphere and the leaching of harmful chemicals from cans disposed in landfills (4 Reasons, n.d.; Carlson et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2015). And although the probability of serious injury is relatively low (Yarbrough, 1998), United States manufacturing and automotive facilities alone use more than 1.6 billion aerosol cans annually, so it is important that they be managed responsibly (Avoid Disposing, 2017).\n\nI am in favor of the proposed rule because it will benefit the environment, streamline the disposal process, and decrease the regulatory burden on manufacturers and businesses while saving money and ensuring that hazardous materials are properly managed.\n\nChanging aerosol cans designation from hazardous to universal waste is appropriate and necessary because the specific nature of aerosol cans require unique management strategies to mitigate risks. Currently, the system for managing aerosol cans as hazardous waste is unnecessarily complicated and difficult. Cans are treated differently based on their volume, contents, and the disposal or recycling equipment and programs that exist at any particular location. The system is also inconsistent from place to place, as individual states may have stipulated more rigorous regulatory provisions for aerosol can disposal (Aerosol Can Disposal, 2017). Streamlining the process of waste disposal by adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program will facilitate more standardized management of cans as well as ensure that they are properly dealt with in ways that prevent accidents or injuries and reduce the environmental impact of cans in landfills.\n\nIt has the potential to save businesses money as well. While disposal of hazardous materials can range from $0.79 per pound up to $25.00 per pound for different substances, other forms of universal waste have greater flexibility in pricing due to the more streamlined process of disposal, especially when recycling alternatives are considered (Indiana University, n.d.; EPA, 2016).\n\nOn the production and manufacturing side, a more streamlined process for aerosol can collection and disposal by universal waste handlers may have a large impact on both landfill capacities and environmental concerns through increased recycling programs that are facilitated by simplified and improved waste management (Avoid Disposing, 2017; Bennett, 2014; How to Recycle Aerosol Cans, n.d.).\n\nIn addition, since households are exempt from compliance with RCRA standards for dealing with hazardous waste, adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program may also have a large impact on consumer behavior and individual participation in recycling programs (EPA, n.d.). Many businesses already offer programs that assist homeowners in safely disposing of hazardous waste materials (Household Hazardous Waste Disposal, n.d.), and the addition of aerosol cans to this list may prompt similar accommodations for households in tandem with industrial and commercial compliance with the new regulations.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge the approval of the proposed rule as well as its careful implementation and evaluation, particularly in the form of thorough research on the environmental impacts of the processing of waste aerosol cans during the disposal process, as I was unable to find any satisfactory scientific analysis of these topics. I further encourage measures that will incentivize and facilitate increased recycling of waste aerosol cans due to the significant environmental and economic benefits that such an investment would stimulate.\n\nReferences are in the attached file.\n\n--- ATTACHMENT CONTENT: attachment_1.pdf ---\n\nThe use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers  \nand the public due to their flammability , pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety  \nManagement Group, 2013).

The Alliance supports EPA in this \ninitiative and believes that r egulating aerosol cans under the universal waste rules will simplify \nmanaging this ubiquitous waste stream.  Current regulations require detailed waste \ncharacterizations for each can, difficult \u201cpoint of generation\u201d determinations, full satellite \naccumulat ion area requirements, and unnecessar ily short  time frames for generators to ship these  \nmaterial s off-site.

As indicated \nin EPA\u2019s  background information and rationale for the proposal , aerosol cans are \u201cwidely used for \ndispensing a broad range of products\u201d 4 by many different entities , and the metal used to make the \ncans has  high potential to be recycled.   The proposed rule present s a hierarchy for aerosol can \nmanagement that requires a generator to have at least three separate can management procedures:  \none for non- hazardous aerosol cans, one for intact universal waste aerosol cans, and one for non-\nintact ( leaking ) hazardous waste aerosol cans.  Incompatible and non- recyclabl e materials would \nalso need to be considered  and would require  additional segregation and management procedures .  \nThe proposed rule  require s each user of an aerosol can to evaluate the can\u2019s regulatory category at \nthe time the can is no longer going to be used, and then follow through and comply with the can\u2019s \ncorresponding management requirements.  This evaluation is required to be repeated for every can \nthroughout a facility.  Although the proposed rule is an improvement over the current requirements  \nby potentially reducing the  regulatory  burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans , the benefits \nof the regulation could be greatly enhanc ed by allowing all aerosol cans \u2014non-hazardous, intact, \nand non- intact cans \u2014to be managed togeth er.  Allowing all a erosol cans to be managed together in \naccumulation container s is more likely to ensure that cans containing hazardous was te will not \ninadvertently be disposed as non -hazardous waste and cans showing evidence of leakage would be \nproperly contained while waiting to be punctured on- site for further recycling or shipped off -site \nfor proper management . \n \nAllowing aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage (non- intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations  for universal waste batteries.  \nUniversal waste handlers may manage leaking (non-intact) batteries as universal waste provided \nthe compromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container ; the handler must \nensure any released materials  are properly contained, characterized , and managed  accordingly.   \nEPA\u2019s approach for identify ing non-qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaking or otherwise \ndamaged where contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d5 is subjective .  Creating \nseparate regulatory requirements for intact and non -intact cans potentially eliminate s the recycling \nopportunity  for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non -compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single aerosol can man agement approach is allowed, the burden for generators \u2014to \nevaluate each can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans,  and comply with different \ncomplex standards  for what ma y appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste\u2014w ill not be measurably reduced.   \nAllowing management of non -hazardous, non- intact, and intact aerosol cans as universal waste is \nexpected to result in no additional risk to human health or the environment.

At 11660.  \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \nImpact on Monthly Generator Category Determinations  \n \nIf EPA establishes an aerosol can as subject to full hazardous waste regulations based on whether \nthe can is intact (or not), generators will have difficulty establishing and maintaining a stable \ngenerator category.   In practice, generators monitor their activities and establish procedures that \nwill ensure compliance based on the highest predictable amount of waste generated.  One of the \ngreatest benefits of moving aer osol cans into the universal waste regulatory structure is that many \ngenerators have the potential to operate in a lower category once aerosol cans are removed from \ntheir monthly hazardous waste generation calculations.  Continuing to have certain cans managed \nas hazardous waste based on unpredictable conditions (evidence of leakage, potential for \npropellants to be dispersed, damaged, etc.) will not provide the full potential of reduced \nrequirements associated with other universal waste regulations nor prov ide a consistent compliance \ncategory for generators.  \n \nThe Alliance  also requests that EPA clarify whether it allows non -hazardous aerosol cans to be \naccumulated with hazardous aerosol cans.  This overly conservative management practice may be \nthe most effective way for a generator to ensure compliance on the plant  floor and facilitate the \nrecycling of the containers.  Eliminating waste characterizations by the user of the can, allowing \neasy collection of the cans, and simplifying the regulatory requirements will provide the greatest \nbenefit to generators and best assurance of proper management \u2014including increased recycling.  \nUnnecessary segregation of materials that may be sent off -site to the same destination facility adds \nadditional bur dens and increased resources without providing any additional environmental \nbenefits.  \n \n \n\u201cPoint of Generation\u201d for Waste Determinations  \n \nEPA has interpreted the \u201cpoint of generation\u201d to be at both the time and place the waste is initially \ngenerated and \u201cthat the [waste] determination cannot be made downstream in the process, where \nother materials could be mixed with the waste or where the waste may have changed its physical or \nchemical characteristics.\u201d 6   Establishing the correct point of generation for this unique waste \nstream is critical since a generator\u2019s category is determined each month based on the amount of \nhazardous waste generated  in that month.  The Alliance requests that EPA clarify the point of \ngeneration for conducting a waste determination for the residue s collected from draining and/ or \npuncturing aerosol cans and for non -intact cans.  Depending on the variety  of products handled, it \nmay be impractical to conduct a complete waste determinat ion until all the residues have been \ncollected and mixed.  Alliance suggests that for res idues collected from draining  and/or puncturing \nactivities, the point of generation is when the handler has determined the waste stream is \nrepresentative of the material that will be shipped off -site. \n \n \nPermit ting Exemption for Puncturing/ Draining Activities  \n \nThe Alliance  supports continuing to exempt puncturing and draining activities from permitting \nsince they are part of the recycling process.  However, the Alliance  requests clarificati on on the \nfollowing statement: \u201cStorage of hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still requires a \npermit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provision.\u201d7   The Alliance requests that \nEPA establish the start of accumulation time to begin when the container is full, not when the \n                                                                    \n6 81 FR 85750 and 85759, \u201cHazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule ,\u201d Final Rule, November 28, 2016.  \n7 83 FR 11660.  \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 5 \n \nfirst initial residue material is added to the container.  This will simplify the burden on generators  \nand support efficient management of the material without imposing restrictive time frames . \nTherefore, the  90/180-day accumulation time limits would be exempt from permitting . \n \n \nAllow \u201cSame Company\u201d Operations to Manage Aerosol Cans W ithout Requiring \nDestination Facility Permitting  \n \nThe Alliance  requests EPA to consider \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers to collect, \npuncture , and drain aerosol cans from \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers without becoming \nuniversal waste destination facilities.  This approach would allow businesses to leverage resources \nto effectively manage aerosol cans.  Similar to the provisions in the H azardous Waste Generator \nImprovements Rule8 that allow a large quantity generator to accept and consolidate its waste with \nhazardous waste from a \u201csame company\u201d very small quantity generator ,9 the Alliance  suggests that \nleveraging resources between same co mpany facilities, such as equipment, trained employees, and \nknowledge of the waste  may  reduce costs and enhance compliance.  \n \n \nAllow Alternative  Labeling Language  \n \nThe Alliance requests that EPA allow gene rators to label the container/ can with any words that \nidentify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container.  Providing more flexible \nlabeling  language  will ease compliance without compr omising proper management of the wastes. \nThis may be accomplished by revising language in proposed 40 CFR  262.273.34(f) as follows: \n(proposed changes in italics and underlined)  \n \n(f) Universal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in which the \naerosol cans are contained, must be labeled or marked clearly with any of the \nfollowing phrases  such as, \u201caerosol can(s)\u201d , \u2018\u2018Universal Waste\u2014 Aerosol \nCan(s)\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Waste Aerosol Can(s)\u2019\u2019, or \u2018\u2018Used Aerosol Can(s)\u2019\u2019, or other words to \nidentify the contents of the container or can, such as, \u201caerosol can(s)\u201d . \n \n \nNo Aerosol Can Size Limit  \n \nThe Alliance  agrees with EPA that there  should not be a size limit  on aerosol containers that may \nbe managed as universal waste.  A size limitation adds an unnecessary complexity to implementing \nthe rules.  \n \n \nPaint Related Material Should be Added as a Universal Waste  \n \nEPA should consider expanding the universal waste rules to include paint and paint -related \nmaterials.   These materials are regulated as universal wastes in both Ohio  and Texas , significantly \nsimplifying the regulatory requirements for these ubiquitous materials and eliminating unnecessary \ncharacterizations.   This approach reduces the pote ntial for these items to be improperly managed \nby providing a simpler, but protective, management approach.   \n \n                                                                    \n8 81 FR 85750 and 85759, \u201cHazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule,\u201d Final Rule, November 28, 2016.  \n9 40 CFR 262.17(f).  \n \n \n \nPage 5 of 5 \n \n \nConclusion  \n \nThe Alliance  appreciates EPA\u2019s consideration of these comments and urges EPA  to increase the \nbreadth of aerosol cans that may be managed as universal waste .

The Alliance supports EPA in this \ninitiative and believes that r egulating aerosol cans under the universal waste rules will simplify \nmanaging this ubiquitous waste stream.  Current regulations require detailed waste \ncharacterizations for each can, difficult \u201cpoint of generation\u201d determinations, full satellite \naccumulat ion area requirements, and unnecessar ily short  time frames for generators to ship these  \nmaterial s off-site.  The streamlined universal waste classification will reduce the compliance \nburden on generators while providing an effective framework to encourage recycling and ensure \nproper management.  \n \nWhile the proposed universal waste rules will simplify the specific requirements that apply to \nintact hazardous waste aerosol cans, the Alliance  believes that the re is an opportunity to greatly \nbroaden the positive impacts of regulating aerosol cans as universal waste if EPA expands the \napplicability provisions of the rules.  As proposed, and if applied in practice , limiting the universal \nwaste category to only non- leaking intact cans greatly restricts the advantages of usi ng the \nuniversal waste category to only a portion of the aeros ol can waste stream and may not create the \nintended simplified system for a greater number of generators.  \n \nWe urge EPA to consider the  following:  \n\u2022 Create a Single Approach for Managing Non -Hazardous, Intact and Non- Intact Aerosol \nCans  \n\u2022 Impact on Monthly Generator Category Determinations  \n\u2022 \u201cPoint of generation\u201d for Waste Determinations  \n\u2022 Permitting Exemption for Puncturing / Draining Activities  \n                                                                    \n1 Alliance members are BMW Group, FCA US, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company, Jaguar Land \nRover, Mazda, Mercedes -Benz USA, Mitsubishi Motors, Porsche Cars North America, Toyota, Volkswagen Group \nof America, and Volvo Cars of North America.

As indicated \nin EPA\u2019s  background information and rationale for the proposal , aerosol cans are \u201cwidely used for \ndispensing a broad range of products\u201d 4 by many different entities , and the metal used to make the \ncans has  high potential to be recycled.   The proposed rule present s a hierarchy for aerosol can \nmanagement that requires a generator to have at least three separate can management procedures:  \none for non- hazardous aerosol cans, one for intact universal waste aerosol cans, and one for non-\nintact ( leaking ) hazardous waste aerosol cans.  Incompatible and non- recyclabl e materials would \nalso need to be considered  and would require  additional segregation and management procedures .  \nThe proposed rule  require s each user of an aerosol can to evaluate the can\u2019s regulatory category at \nthe time the can is no longer going to be used, and then follow through and comply with the can\u2019s \ncorresponding management requirements.  This evaluation is required to be repeated for every can \nthroughout a facility.  Although the proposed rule is an improvement over the current requirements  \nby potentially reducing the  regulatory  burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans , the benefits \nof the regulation could be greatly enhanc ed by allowing all aerosol cans \u2014non-hazardous, intact, \nand non- intact cans \u2014to be managed togeth er.  Allowing all a erosol cans to be managed together in \naccumulation container s is more likely to ensure that cans containing hazardous was te will not \ninadvertently be disposed as non -hazardous waste and cans showing evidence of leakage would be \nproperly contained while waiting to be punctured on- site for further recycling or shipped off -site \nfor proper management . \n \nAllowing aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage (non- intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations  for universal waste batteries.  \nUniversal waste handlers may manage leaking (non-intact) batteries as universal waste provided \nthe compromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container ; the handler must \nensure any released materials  are properly contained, characterized , and managed  accordingly.   \nEPA\u2019s approach for identify ing non-qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaking or otherwise \ndamaged where contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d5 is subjective .  Creating \nseparate regulatory requirements for intact and non -intact cans potentially eliminate s the recycling \nopportunity  for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non -compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single aerosol can man agement approach is allowed, the burden for generators \u2014to \nevaluate each can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans,  and comply with different \ncomplex standards  for what ma y appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste\u2014w ill not be measurably reduced.   \nAllowing management of non -hazardous, non- intact, and intact aerosol cans as universal waste is \nexpected to result in no additional risk to human health or the environment.  Lastly, managing non -\nhazardous aerosol cans as universal waste would be optional for generators and not a requirement.  \n \n                                                                    \n4 83 Federal Register (FR) 11656, \u201cIncreasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations,\u201d \nProposed Rule, March 16, 2018.  \n5 Id. At 11660.  \n \n \n \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \nImpact on Monthly Generator Category Determinations  \n \nIf EPA establishes an aerosol can as subject to full hazardous waste regulations based on whether \nthe can is intact (or not), generators will have difficulty establishing and maintaining a stable \ngenerator category.   In practice, generators monitor their activities and establish procedures that \nwill ensure compliance based on the highest predictable amount of waste generated.  One of the \ngreatest benefits of moving aer osol cans into the universal waste regulatory structure is that many \ngenerators have the potential to operate in a lower category once aerosol cans are removed from \ntheir monthly hazardous waste generation calculations.  Continuing to have certain cans managed \nas hazardous waste based on unpredictable conditions (evidence of leakage, potential for \npropellants to be dispersed, damaged, etc.) will not provide the full potential of reduced \nrequirements associated with other universal waste regulations nor prov ide a consistent compliance \ncategory for generators.  \n \nThe Alliance  also requests that EPA clarify whether it allows non -hazardous aerosol cans to be \naccumulated with hazardous aerosol cans.  This overly conservative management practice may be \nthe most effective way for a generator to ensure compliance on the plant  floor and facilitate the \nrecycling of the containers.  Eliminating waste characterizations by the user of the can, allowing \neasy collection of the cans, and simplifying the regulatory requirements will provide the greatest \nbenefit to generators and best assurance of proper management \u2014including increased recycling.  \nUnnecessary segregation of materials that may be sent off -site to the same destination facility adds \nadditional bur dens and increased resources without providing any additional environmental \nbenefits.  \n \n \n\u201cPoint of Generation\u201d for Waste Determinations  \n \nEPA has interpreted the \u201cpoint of generation\u201d to be at both the time and place the waste is initially \ngenerated and \u201cthat the [waste] determination cannot be made downstream in the process, where \nother materials could be mixed with the waste or where the waste may have changed its physical or \nchemical characteristics.\u201d 6   Establishing the correct point of generation for this unique waste \nstream is critical since a generator\u2019s category is determined each month based on the amount of \nhazardous waste generated  in that month.  The Alliance requests that EPA clarify the point of \ngeneration for conducting a waste determination for the residue s collected from draining and/ or \npuncturing aerosol cans and for non -intact cans.  Depending on the variety  of products handled, it \nmay be impractical to conduct a complete waste determinat ion until all the residues have been \ncollected and mixed.  Alliance suggests that for res idues collected from draining  and/or puncturing \nactivities, the point of generation is when the handler has determined the waste stream is \nrepresentative of the material that will be shipped off -site. \n \n \nPermit ting Exemption for Puncturing/ Draining Activities  \n \nThe Alliance  supports continuing to exempt puncturing and draining activities from permitting \nsince they are part of the recycling process.  However, the Alliance  requests clarificati on on the \nfollowing statement: \u201cStorage of hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still requires a \npermit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provision.\u201d7   The Alliance requests that \nEPA establish the start of accumulation time to begin when the container is full, not when the \n                                                                    \n6 81 FR 85750 and 85759, \u201cHazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule ,\u201d Final Rule, November 28, 2016.  \n7 83 FR 11660.  \n \n \n \nPage 4 of 5 \n \nfirst initial residue material is added to the container.  This will simplify the burden on generators  \nand support efficient management of the material without imposing restrictive time frames . \nTherefore, the  90/180-day accumulation time limits would be exempt from permitting . \n \n \nAllow \u201cSame Company\u201d Operations to Manage Aerosol Cans W ithout Requiring \nDestination Facility Permitting  \n \nThe Alliance  requests EPA to consider \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers to collect, \npuncture , and drain aerosol cans from \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers without becoming \nuniversal waste destination facilities.  This approach would allow businesses to leverage resources \nto effectively manage aerosol cans.  Similar to the provisions in the H azardous Waste Generator \nImprovements Rule8 that allow a large quantity generator to accept and consolidate its waste with \nhazardous waste from a \u201csame company\u201d very small quantity generator ,9 the Alliance  suggests that \nleveraging resources between same co mpany facilities, such as equipment, trained employees, and \nknowledge of the waste  may  reduce costs and enhance compliance.  \n \n \nAllow Alternative  Labeling Language  \n \nThe Alliance requests that EPA allow gene rators to label the container/ can with any words that \nidentify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container.  Providing more flexible \nlabeling  language  will ease compliance without compr omising proper management of the wastes. \nThis may be accomplished by revising language in proposed 40 CFR  262.273.34(f) as follows: \n(proposed changes in italics and underlined)  \n \n(f) Universal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in which the \naerosol cans are contained, must be labeled or marked clearly with any of the \nfollowing phrases  such as, \u201caerosol can(s)\u201d , \u2018\u2018Universal Waste\u2014 Aerosol \nCan(s)\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Waste Aerosol Can(s)\u2019\u2019, or \u2018\u2018Used Aerosol Can(s)\u2019\u2019, or other words to \nidentify the contents of the container or can, such as, \u201caerosol can(s)\u201d . \n \n \nNo Aerosol Can Size Limit  \n \nThe Alliance  agrees with EPA that there  should not be a size limit  on aerosol containers that may \nbe managed as universal waste.  A size limitation adds an unnecessary complexity to implementing \nthe rules.  \n \n \nPaint Related Material Should be Added as a Universal Waste  \n \nEPA should consider expanding the universal waste rules to include paint and paint -related \nmaterials.   These materials are regulated as universal wastes in both Ohio  and Texas , significantly \nsimplifying the regulatory requirements for these ubiquitous materials and eliminating unnecessary \ncharacterizations.   This approach reduces the pote ntial for these items to be improperly managed \nby providing a simpler, but protective, management approach.   \n \n                                                                    \n8 81 FR 85750 and 85759, \u201cHazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule,\u201d Final Rule, November 28, 2016.  \n9 40 CFR 262.17(f).  \n \n \n \nPage 5 of 5 \n \n \nConclusion  \n \nThe Alliance  appreciates EPA\u2019s consideration of these comments and urges EPA  to increase the \nbreadth of aerosol cans that may be managed as universal waste .  If you have any questions \nregarding these comments, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.  \n \nBest Regards,  \n \n \n \nStacy Tatman  \nDirector, Environmental Affairs  \nAlliance of Automobile Manufacturers  \n202.326.5551 \nstatman@autoalliance.org  \n \n\n"

As an advancement in academics I\u2019m working on developing sustainable strategies for villages in Steuben County where waste management is one of the key aspect for moving towards a sustainable development. The regulation caught my interest as it is a step for streamlining waste management for aerosol products which are expanding very rapidly.  Aerosol cans are handy items, but their disposal may pose special risks to environment. They offer wide range of products especially mass-market goods such as household and cosmetic. According to Consumer Specialty Products Association (CSPA) aerosol pressurized products survey revealed that the estimated total units filled in the U.S. in 2011 was 3.782 billion representing a 1% increase than 2010. (Consumer Specialty Products Association, 2012) The survey also found out that personal care products are said to be the second largest category in the aerosol products. They are harmful to human health due to their psychoactive effects which may interfere with regular functioning of the body. (Hubbard, 2017) Improper disposal, leakage and mishandling of aerosol cans can lead to serious environmental concerns such as release of emissions, leaching and damage to the air quality.  I am in a strong favor of the proposed rule because despite fall in personal care, overall aerosol production is rising, and component suppliers are still expanding. (Yeomans, 2013) This expansion requires unique management and disposal strategies which can be accomplished through the EPA\u2019s proposal of adding hazardous waste aerosol cans to the list of universal waste regulation. The regulation will ease regulatory burdens on retail stores for discarding \naerosol cans, promote collection and recycling and will encourage development of programs to reduce the quantity of these wastes going to landfills or combustors. (Environmental Protection Agency, 2018) EPA\u2019s specific stringent management standards for puncturing and draining of aerosol cans will also safeguard workers who are responsible for this activity.   A single aerosol can doesn\u2019t take up much space, but 1.6 billion cans which is produced annually by United States would require acres and acres of landfill space. (Karen, 2018) In this case, the proposal would prevent tons of aerosol cans to pile up on landfills and instead would be recycled reducing hazardous waste. The idea of not having a size limit and volume for aerosol cans can widely help in changing retail and household behavior as recycling process would begin at source making waste handling and managing less complex. The standards also include labelling, a requirement to respond to releases, and transport to a facility that is permitted or otherwise designated for receiving hazardous waste. (Enviro.BLR, 2017)  Although the proposed rule is largely in line, there are several aspects for noteworthy to achieve maximum results. The empty aerosol cans would be excluded from universal waste rule, but it be should strictly monitored that the cans are properly deemed empty as some cans may exhibit the characteristic of reactivity. The new requirements for puncturing and draining as a part of recycling process should be established. As according to EPA, \u2018\u2018states\u2026. would have to adopt the universal waste regulations for aerosol cans\u2019\u2019, it would be beneficial if the rule is a mandate for each state to reduce landfill burden and global environmental issues. The proposed rule is silent on the requirements that would apply to aerosol waste shipments \nbetween states that adopt the rule and states that do not, therefore mandating would also ease transportation concerns.  Concluding, I impel that the rule should be passed to relief regulated community as tiny particles from aerosol cans can lead to big impacts.

COSTHA supports the addition of hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste \nprogram under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) \nregulations . We believe the streamlined management rules for Universal Wastes \nwould simplify regulated waste management procedures  for generators and \nhandlers,  result in significant cost savings, provide additional waste management \noptions for aerosol cans , and promote recycling of aerosol cans  while providing  a \nframework to manage these waste streams in a safe, responsible, and compliant \nway.  \n \n \n     \n \n\nComments on the definition of an aerosol can and the types of materials that should fall \nunder it : \n \n\u2022 COSTHA suggests that the definition of an aerosol provided in the UN model regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods be adopted in this  regulation to harmonize \nwith the international community. This is  a more inclusive definition of aerosols and \nwould allow aerosol c ans which are designed to expel product in forms other than a \nspray or foam to be included in the program . \n\u2022 COSTHA supports the exclusion of aerosol c ans meeting the definition of empty. Thes e \ncontainers are not currently regulated as hazardous waste and should continue to be managed as non- regulated materials and recycled for their scrap metal value.  \n\u2022 COSTHA supports the EPA decision not to include a statutory size limit on the aerosol cans as  the size does not impact how the containers will be managed. In practice, most \naerosol c ans will have a capacity of  1 liter or less since transportation regulations limit \nthe capacity to 1 liter for transport as an aerosol.  \n Comments on puncturing and dra ining of aerosol containers for recycling:  \n \n\u2022 COSTHA agrees that leaking or corroded aerosol c ans should be excluded from the \nuniversal waste program and continue to be handled as fully regulated hazardous waste \nif they must be offered for disposal, but we believe that the generator should be allowed \nto puncture and recover the contents of the c an using an appropriate commercial device, \nthen offer the can for recycling. This provides an improved measure of safety versus \ntransporting leaking or damaged c ans for disposal .  \n\u2022 COSTHA suggests that the option to puncture and drain any aerosol can, then offer the \ncan for recycling, should be available for all types of materials and it should be the \nresponsibility of the generator  or handler  to ensure the materials in the aerosol c an are \ncompatible with the puncturing device and receiving container.  \n \nCOSTHA appreciates the opportunity to comment on this proposal.

NRECA is a member of the \nUtility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG), and these comments hereby incorporate by reference the \ncomments submitted by that organiza tion.   \n \nNRECA is the national service organization for America\u2019s more than 900 rural electric cooperatives which are \nresponsible for keeping the lights on for more than 42 million people across 47 states.  The nation\u2019s member -\nowned, not -for-profit electri c co-ops constitute a unique sector of the electric utility industry \u2013 and face a unique \nset of challenges.  Most are small businesses (as defined by the Small Business Administration) and  depend on \ntheir member -owners  (e.g.,  farmers, ranchers, small busin esses, and other residents of the nation\u2019s rural \ncommunities ) to fund their operations including compliance with environmental regulations.  \n \nNRECA supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the current Universal Waste program.  America\u2019s electric \ncoope ratives use a variety of aerosol products such as pesticides , paints, cleaning supplies , and disinfectants .  \nElectric cooperatives also use these products at a variety of locations including administrative offices, generation \nfacilities , and substations.  If the cooperatives were able to accumulate aerosol cans at a central ized collection \npoint , associated  disposal  costs would be decreased  while increasing the recovery and recycling of the  cans \nthemselves .  The success of EPA\u2019s current Universal Waste program as well as state programs is a testament to \nbenefits and protectiveness that can be expected by managing  aerosol cans  as universal waste . \n \nDocket No.: EPA -HQ-OW-2018 -0063  \nMay 21, 2018  \n \n4301 Wilson Blvd. | Arlington, VA 22203 -1860 | Tel: 703.907.5500 | electric.coop | @NRECANews  Pg. 2 NRECA has comments on the proposed universal waste management standards for aerosol cans.  First, we agree \nwith EPA that the universal waste management standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal wast e.  A requirement to weigh individual cans would likely negate any \nburden reduction that would be gained by managing the cans as universal waste.  Second, we urge EPA not to \nestablish management standards requiring  the use of commercial device  for puncturing and/or drain waste aerosol \ncans and associated written procedures regarding its use , but instead  to allow generators that have been safely \npuncturing and draining aerosol cans under the full hazardous waste regulations to continue doing so under the \nUniversal Waste program .  Finally, we ask EPA to clarify that, while aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage must still be manag ed under the full hazardous waste regulations, such cans may still be \nsafely punctured and drained to reduce the risks associated with future management of such cans.  \n \nRural cooperative members \u2013 like all Americans \u2013 value and deserve a clean, healthy envi ronment, but we and \nour members can not afford to spend scarce resources in manners that do not provide a significant environmental \nbang for the regulatory compliance buck.  NRECA greatly appreciates EPA\u2019s recognition that regulating aerosol \ncans as univers al waste is a good idea that will reduce waste management costs for America\u2019s electric \ncooperatives  and increase the recycling and recovery of metals in these cans without increasing the risk to the \nenvironment.

The nation\u2019s member -\nowned, not -for-profit electri c co-ops constitute a unique sector of the electric utility industry \u2013 and face a unique \nset of challenges.  Most are small businesses (as defined by the Small Business Administration) and  depend on \ntheir member -owners  (e.g.,  farmers, ranchers, small busin esses, and other residents of the nation\u2019s rural \ncommunities ) to fund their operations including compliance with environmental regulations.  \n \nNRECA supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the current Universal Waste program.  America\u2019s electric \ncoope ratives use a variety of aerosol products such as pesticides , paints, cleaning supplies , and disinfectants .  \nElectric cooperatives also use these products at a variety of locations including administrative offices, generation \nfacilities , and substations.  If the cooperatives were able to accumulate aerosol cans at a central ized collection \npoint , associated  disposal  costs would be decreased  while increasing the recovery and recycling of the  cans \nthemselves .  The success of EPA\u2019s current Universal Waste program as well as state programs is a testament to \nbenefits and protectiveness that can be expected by managing  aerosol cans  as universal waste . \n \nDocket No.: EPA -HQ-OW-2018 -0063  \nMay 21, 2018  \n \n4301 Wilson Blvd. | Arlington, VA 22203 -1860 | Tel: 703.907.5500 | electric.coop | @NRECANews  Pg. 2 NRECA has comments on the proposed universal waste management standards for aerosol cans.  First, we agree \nwith EPA that the universal waste management standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal wast e.  A requirement to weigh individual cans would likely negate any \nburden reduction that would be gained by managing the cans as universal waste.  Second, we urge EPA not to \nestablish management standards requiring  the use of commercial device  for puncturing and/or drain waste aerosol \ncans and associated written procedures regarding its use , but instead  to allow generators that have been safely \npuncturing and draining aerosol cans under the full hazardous waste regulations to continue doing so under the \nUniversal Waste program .  Finally, we ask EPA to clarify that, while aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damage must still be manag ed under the full hazardous waste regulations, such cans may still be \nsafely punctured and drained to reduce the risks associated with future management of such cans.  \n \nRural cooperative members \u2013 like all Americans \u2013 value and deserve a clean, healthy envi ronment, but we and \nour members can not afford to spend scarce resources in manners that do not provide a significant environmental \nbang for the regulatory compliance buck.  NRECA greatly appreciates EPA\u2019s recognition that regulating aerosol \ncans as univers al waste is a good idea that will reduce waste management costs for America\u2019s electric \ncooperatives  and increase the recycling and recovery of metals in these cans without increasing the risk to the \nenvironment.  We look forward to a final rule implementing  this proposal . \n \nIf you have any questions regarding these comments, please contact me at Dorothy.kellogg@nreca.coop  .  \n \nRespectfully submit ted, \n \nDorothy Allen Kellogg   \nRegulatory Director, Environmental Policy  \n \n \n\n"

Reg. 11 ,654 (Mar. 1 6, 2018 ); Docket No. EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017-0463  \n \nDear Sir or Madam : \n \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world\u2019s largest business federation representing the \ninterests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local \nchambers and industry associations, and dedicated to promoting , protecting, and defending \nAmerica\u2019s free enterprise system, submits these comments in support  of the U.S. En vironmental \nProtection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s  or Agency\u2019s ) proposal  to expand the universal waste regulations to \ninclude aerosol cans .1   \n \nThe Chamber  supports EPA in this initiative and believes that regulating aerosol cans under \nthe universal waste rules will simplify managing this ubiquitous waste stream.  Current regulations \nrequire detailed waste characterizations for each can, difficult \u201cpoint of generation\u201d determinations, \nfull satellite accumulation area requirements, and unnecessarily short time frames for generators to \nship these materials off -site.  The streamlined universal waste classification will reduce the \ncompliance burden on generators while providing an effective framework to encourage recycling \nand ensure proper management.  \n \nWhile the proposed universal waste rules will simplify the specific requirements that apply to \nintact hazardous waste aerosol cans, the Chamber  believes that there  is an opportunity to greatly \nbroaden the positive impacts of regulating aerosol cans as universal waste if EPA expands the \napplicability provisions of the rules.  As proposed, and if applied in practice, limiting the universal \nwaste category to only non -leaking intact cans greatly restricts the advantages of using the universal \nwaste category to only a portion of the aerosol can waste stream and may not create the intended \nsimplified system for a greater number of generators.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations, 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654 (Mar. 16 , 2018).  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n \n With that said, the Chamber p rovides the following comments on EPA\u2019s proposal:  \n \nI. EPA Should Create a Single Approach for Managing Non -Hazardous, Intact, and \nNon -Intact Aerosol Cans  \n \nThe Chamber requests that EPA create a single regulatory structure for aerosol cans that \nallows non-hazardous, non -intact, and intact aerosol cans to be managed as universal waste.  As \nindicated in EPA\u2019s background information and rationale for the proposal, aerosol cans are \u201cwidely \nused for dispensing a broad range of products\u201d2 by many different en tities, and the metal used to \nmake the cans has high potential to be recycled.  The proposal  present s a hierarchy for aerosol can \nmanagement that requires a generator to have at least three separate can management procedures:  \none for non -hazardous aerosol  cans, one for intact universal waste aerosol cans, and one for non -\nintact (leaking) hazardous waste aerosol cans.  Incompatible and non -recyclable materials would also \nneed to be considered and would require additional segregation and management procedure s.  \nEPA\u2019s proposal require s each user of an aerosol can to evaluate the can\u2019s regulatory category at the \ntime the can is no longer going to be used, and then follow through and comply with the can\u2019s \ncorresponding management requirements.  This evaluation i s required to be repeated for every can \nthroughout a facility.   \n \nAlthough the proposal is  an improvement over the current requirements by potentially \nreducing the regulatory burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans, the benefits of the rules \ncould b e greatly enhanced by allowing all  aerosol cans \u2013 non-hazardous, intact , and non -intact cans \n\u2013 to be managed together.  Allowing all aerosol cans to be managed together in accumulation \ncontainers is more likely to ensure that cans containing hazardous wast e will not inadvertently be \ndisposed as non -hazardous waste and cans showing evidence of leakage would be properly \ncontained while waiting to be punctured on -site for further recycling or shipped off -site for proper \nmanagement.  \n \nAllowing aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage (non -intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations for universal waste batteries.3  \nUniversal waste handlers may manage leaking (non -intact) batteries as universal waste provided t he \ncompromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container; the handler must ensure \nany released materials are properly contained, characterized, and managed accordingly.  EPA\u2019s \napproach for identifying non -qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaking or otherwise damaged \nwhere contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d4 is overly subjective.  Creating \nseparate regulatory requirements for intact and non -intact cans potentially eliminates the recycling \nopportunity for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non -compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single aerosol can management approach is allowed, the b urden for generators \u2013 to evaluate \neach can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans, and comply with d ifferent complex \nstandards for what may appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste \u2013 will not be measurably reduced.  Allowing \nmanagement of  non-hazardous,  non-intact , and intact  non-hazardous  aerosol cans as universal waste \nis expected to result in no additional risk to human health or the environment.  Lastly, managing \n                                                 \n2 Id. at 11,656.  \n3 E.g., 40 C.F.R. 273.13(a)(1) & 273.33(a)(1) . \n4 83 Fed. Reg.  at 11,660.  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \n non-hazardous  aerosol  cans as universal waste would be optional for generators and not a \nrequirement.  \n \nII. Incorporating All Aero sol Cans Will Positively Impact Monthly Generator Category \nDeterminations   \n \nIf EPA establishes an aerosol can as subject to full hazardous waste regulations based on \nwhether the can is intact (or not), generators will have difficulty establishing and maint aining a stable \ngenerator category.  In practice, generators monitor their activities and establish procedures that will \nensure compliance based on the highest predictable amount of waste generated.   \n \nOne of the greatest benefits of moving aerosol cans in to the universal waste regulatory \nstructure is that many generators have the potential to operate in a lower category once aerosol cans \nare removed from their monthly hazardous waste generation calculations.  Continuing to have \ncertain cans managed as haza rdous waste based on unpredictable conditions (evidence of leakage, \npotential for propellants to be dispersed, damaged, etc.) will not provide the full potential of reduced \nrequirements associated with other universal waste regulations nor provide a consis tent compliance \ncategory for generators.  \n \nThe Chamber also requests that EPA clarify whether it allows non -hazardous aerosol cans to \nbe accumulated with hazardous aerosol cans.  This overly conservative management practice may be \nthe most effective way for  a generator to ensure compliance on the plant floor and facilitate the \nrecycling of the containers.  Eliminating waste characterizations by the user of the can, allowing easy \ncollection of the cans, and simplifying the regulatory requirements will provide  the greatest benefit \nto generators and best assurance of proper management \u2013 including increased recycling.  \nUnnecessary segregation of materials that may be sent off -site to the same destination facility adds \nadditional burdens and increased resources wi thout providing any additional environmental benefits.  \n  \nIII. EPA Should Clarify the \u201cPoint of Generation\u201d for Waste Determinations  \n \nThe Chamber requests that EPA clarify the point of generation for conducting a waste \ndetermination for the residue s collected from draining and/ or puncturing aerosol  cans and for non -\nintact cans.  EPA has interpreted the \u201cpoint of generation\u201d to be at both the time and place the \nwaste is initially generated and \u201cthat the [waste] determination cannot be made downstream in the \nprocess, where other materials could be mixed with the waste or where the waste may have changed \nits physical or  chemical characteristics.\u201d5  Establishing the correct point of generation for this unique \nwaste stream is critical since a generator\u2019s category is determined each month based on the amount \nof hazardous waste generated in that month.  \n \nDepending on the variety of products handled, it may be impractical to conduct a complete \nwaste determination until all the residues  have been collected and mixed.  The  Chamber suggests \nthat for r esidues collected from draining /puncturing activities, the point of generation is when the \nhandler has determined the waste stream is representative of the material that will be shipped off -\nsite. \n                                                 \n5 Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule , 81 Fed. Reg. 85,750, 85,759 (Nov. 28, 2016).  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 4 of 5 \n \n \n  \nIV. EPA Should Clarify the Proposal\u2019 s Perm itting Exemption for Puncturing/ Draining \nActivities  \n \nThe Chamber supports continuing to exempt puncturing and draining activities from \npermitting since they are part of the recycling process.  However, the Chamber requests clarification \non the follow ing statement  \u2013 \u201cStorage of hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still \nrequires a permit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provision.\u201d6   \n \nThe U.S. Chamber requests that EPA establish the start of the accumulation time to begin \nwhen the container is full, not when the first initial residue material is added to the container.  This \nwill simplify the burden on generations and support efficient management of the material without \nimposing restrictive time frames ( 90/180 -day accumulat ion time limi ts to be exempt from \npermitting).  \n  \nV. EPA Should Allow \u201cSame Company\u201d Operations to Manage Aerosol Cans Without \nRequiring Destination Facility Permitting  \n \nThe Chamber requests EPA to consider \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers to collect, \npuncture and drain aerosol cans from \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers without becoming \nuniversal waste destination facilities.  This approach would allow businesses to levera ge resources to \neffectively manage aerosol cans.  Similar to the provisions in EPA\u2019s  Generator Improvements Rule \nthat allow a large quantity generator to accept and consolidate its waste with hazardous waste from a \n\u201csame company\u201d very small quantity genera tor,7 the Chamber suggests that leveraging resources \nbetween same company facilities, such as equipment, trained employees, and knowledge of the \nwaste, may reduce costs and enhance compliance.  \n \nVI. EPA Should Allow Alternative Labeling Language  \n \nThe Chamber  requests that EPA allow ge nerators to label a container or can with any words \nthat identify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container.  Providing more flexible \nlabeling language will ease compliance without comprising proper management of th e wastes.   This \nmay be accomplished by revising language in proposed 40 CFR 262.273.34(f) as follows: (proposed \nchanges in italics and underlined)  \n \n(f) Universal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in which the \naerosol cans are cont ained, must be labeled or marked clearly with any of the \nfollowing phrases , \u201cUniversal Waste \u2014Aerosol Can(s)\u201d , \u201cWaste Aerosol Can(s)\u201d, or \n\u201cUsed Aerosol Can(s) ,\u201d or other words to identify the contents of the container or can, such as, \n\u201caerosol can(s)\u201d . \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660.  \n7 40 C.F.R. 262.17(f).  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 5 of 5 \n \n \n VII. There Should be No Size Limit on Aerosol Containers  \n \nThe Chamber  agrees with EPA that there should not be a size limit on aerosol containers \nthat may be managed as universal waste.  A size limitation adds an unnecessary complexity to \nimplementing the rules.  \n \nVIII.  Paint Related Material Should be Added as a Universal Waste  \n \nEPA should consider expanding the universal waste rules to include paint and paint -related \nmaterials.   These materials are regulated as universal wastes in both Ohio8 and Texas ,9 significantly \nsimplifying the regulatory requirements for these ubiquitous ma terials and eliminating unnecessary \ncharacterizations.   This approach reduces the potential for these items to be improperly managed by \nproviding a simpler, but protective, management approach.   \n \nIX. Conclusion  \n \nThe Chamber appreciates EPA\u2019s consideration of these comments and urges EPA to \nincrease the breadth of aerosol cans that may be managed as universal waste .

The  Chamber suggests \nthat for r esidues collected from draining /puncturing activities, the point of generation is when the \nhandler has determined the waste stream is representative of the material that will be shipped off -\nsite. \n                                                 \n5 Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule , 81 Fed.

EPA Should Clarify the Proposal\u2019 s Perm itting Exemption for Puncturing/ Draining \nActivities  \n \nThe Chamber supports continuing to exempt puncturing and draining activities from \npermitting since they are part of the recycling process.  However, the Chamber requests clarification \non the follow ing statement  \u2013 \u201cStorage of hazardous waste aerosol cans prior to recycling still \nrequires a permit, unless it is exempt from permitting under another provision.\u201d6   \n \nThe U.S. Chamber requests that EPA establish the start of the accumulation time to begin \nwhen the container is full, not when the first initial residue material is added to the container.  This \nwill simplify the burden on generations and support efficient management of the material without \nimposing restrictive time frames ( 90/180 -day accumulat ion time limi ts to be exempt from \npermitting).  \n  \nV. EPA Should Allow \u201cSame Company\u201d Operations to Manage Aerosol Cans Without \nRequiring Destination Facility Permitting  \n \nThe Chamber requests EPA to consider \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers to collect, \npuncture and drain aerosol cans from \u201csame company\u201d generators and handlers without becoming \nuniversal waste destination facilities.  This approach would allow businesses to levera ge resources to \neffectively manage aerosol cans.  Similar to the provisions in EPA\u2019s  Generator Improvements Rule \nthat allow a large quantity generator to accept and consolidate its waste with hazardous waste from a \n\u201csame company\u201d very small quantity genera tor,7 the Chamber suggests that leveraging resources \nbetween same company facilities, such as equipment, trained employees, and knowledge of the \nwaste, may reduce costs and enhance compliance.  \n \nVI. EPA Should Allow Alternative Labeling Language  \n \nThe Chamber  requests that EPA allow ge nerators to label a container or can with any words \nthat identify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container.  Providing more flexible \nlabeling language will ease compliance without comprising proper management of th e wastes.   This \nmay be accomplished by revising language in proposed 40 CFR 262.273.34(f) as follows: (proposed \nchanges in italics and underlined)  \n \n(f) Universal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in which the \naerosol cans are cont ained, must be labeled or marked clearly with any of the \nfollowing phrases , \u201cUniversal Waste \u2014Aerosol Can(s)\u201d , \u201cWaste Aerosol Can(s)\u201d, or \n\u201cUsed Aerosol Can(s) ,\u201d or other words to identify the contents of the container or can, such as, \n\u201caerosol can(s)\u201d . \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6 83 Fed.

Reg. 11 ,654 (Mar. 1 6, 2018 ); Docket No. EPA -HQ-OLEM -2017-0463  \n \nDear Sir or Madam : \n \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world\u2019s largest business federation representing the \ninterests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as well as state and local \nchambers and industry associations, and dedicated to promoting , protecting, and defending \nAmerica\u2019s free enterprise system, submits these comments in support  of the U.S. En vironmental \nProtection Agency\u2019s (EPA\u2019s  or Agency\u2019s ) proposal  to expand the universal waste regulations to \ninclude aerosol cans .1   \n \nThe Chamber  supports EPA in this initiative and believes that regulating aerosol cans under \nthe universal waste rules will simplify managing this ubiquitous waste stream.  Current regulations \nrequire detailed waste characterizations for each can, difficult \u201cpoint of generation\u201d determinations, \nfull satellite accumulation area requirements, and unnecessarily short time frames for generators to \nship these materials off -site.  The streamlined universal waste classification will reduce the \ncompliance burden on generators while providing an effective framework to encourage recycling \nand ensure proper management.  \n \nWhile the proposed universal waste rules will simplify the specific requirements that apply to \nintact hazardous waste aerosol cans, the Chamber  believes that there  is an opportunity to greatly \nbroaden the positive impacts of regulating aerosol cans as universal waste if EPA expands the \napplicability provisions of the rules.  As proposed, and if applied in practice, limiting the universal \nwaste category to only non -leaking intact cans greatly restricts the advantages of using the universal \nwaste category to only a portion of the aerosol can waste stream and may not create the intended \nsimplified system for a greater number of generators.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations, 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654 (Mar. 16 , 2018).  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n \n With that said, the Chamber p rovides the following comments on EPA\u2019s proposal:  \n \nI. EPA Should Create a Single Approach for Managing Non -Hazardous, Intact, and \nNon -Intact Aerosol Cans  \n \nThe Chamber requests that EPA create a single regulatory structure for aerosol cans that \nallows non-hazardous, non -intact, and intact aerosol cans to be managed as universal waste.  As \nindicated in EPA\u2019s background information and rationale for the proposal, aerosol cans are \u201cwidely \nused for dispensing a broad range of products\u201d2 by many different en tities, and the metal used to \nmake the cans has high potential to be recycled.  The proposal  present s a hierarchy for aerosol can \nmanagement that requires a generator to have at least three separate can management procedures:  \none for non -hazardous aerosol  cans, one for intact universal waste aerosol cans, and one for non -\nintact (leaking) hazardous waste aerosol cans.  Incompatible and non -recyclable materials would also \nneed to be considered and would require additional segregation and management procedure s.  \nEPA\u2019s proposal require s each user of an aerosol can to evaluate the can\u2019s regulatory category at the \ntime the can is no longer going to be used, and then follow through and comply with the can\u2019s \ncorresponding management requirements.  This evaluation i s required to be repeated for every can \nthroughout a facility.   \n \nAlthough the proposal is  an improvement over the current requirements by potentially \nreducing the regulatory burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans, the benefits of the rules \ncould b e greatly enhanced by allowing all  aerosol cans \u2013 non-hazardous, intact , and non -intact cans \n\u2013 to be managed together.  Allowing all aerosol cans to be managed together in accumulation \ncontainers is more likely to ensure that cans containing hazardous wast e will not inadvertently be \ndisposed as non -hazardous waste and cans showing evidence of leakage would be properly \ncontained while waiting to be punctured on -site for further recycling or shipped off -site for proper \nmanagement.  \n \nAllowing aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage (non -intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations for universal waste batteries.3  \nUniversal waste handlers may manage leaking (non -intact) batteries as universal waste provided t he \ncompromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container; the handler must ensure \nany released materials are properly contained, characterized, and managed accordingly.  EPA\u2019s \napproach for identifying non -qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaking or otherwise damaged \nwhere contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d4 is overly subjective.  Creating \nseparate regulatory requirements for intact and non -intact cans potentially eliminates the recycling \nopportunity for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non -compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single aerosol can management approach is allowed, the b urden for generators \u2013 to evaluate \neach can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans, and comply with d ifferent complex \nstandards for what may appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste \u2013 will not be measurably reduced.  Allowing \nmanagement of  non-hazardous,  non-intact , and intact  non-hazardous  aerosol cans as universal waste \nis expected to result in no additional risk to human health or the environment.  Lastly, managing \n                                                 \n2 Id. at 11,656.  \n3 E.g., 40 C.F.R. 273.13(a)(1) & 273.33(a)(1) . \n4 83 Fed. Reg.  at 11,660.  \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency  \nMay 15 , 2018  \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n \n non-hazardous  aerosol  cans as universal waste would be optional for generators and not a \nrequirement.  \n \nII. Incorporating All Aero sol Cans Will Positively Impact Monthly Generator Category \nDeterminations   \n \nIf EPA establishes an aerosol can as subject to full hazardous waste regulations based on \nwhether the can is intact (or not), generators will have difficulty establishing and maint aining a stable \ngenerator category.  In practice, generators monitor their activities and establish procedures that will \nensure compliance based on the highest predictable amount of waste generated.   \n \nOne of the greatest benefits of moving aerosol cans in to the universal waste regulatory \nstructure is that many generators have the potential to operate in a lower category once aerosol cans \nare removed from their monthly hazardous waste generation calculations.  Continuing to have \ncertain cans managed as haza rdous waste based on unpredictable conditions (evidence of leakage, \npotential for propellants to be dispersed, damaged, etc.) will not provide the full potential of reduced \nrequirements associated with other universal waste regulations nor provide a consis tent compliance \ncategory for generators.  \n \nThe Chamber also requests that EPA clarify whether it allows non -hazardous aerosol cans to \nbe accumulated with hazardous aerosol cans.  This overly conservative management practice may be \nthe most effective way for  a generator to ensure compliance on the plant floor and facilitate the \nrecycling of the containers.  Eliminating waste characterizations by the user of the can, allowing easy \ncollection of the cans, and simplifying the regulatory requirements will provide  the greatest benefit \nto generators and best assurance of proper management \u2013 including increased recycling.  \nUnnecessary segregation of materials that may be sent off -site to the same destination facility adds \nadditional burdens and increased resources wi thout providing any additional environmental benefits.  \n  \nIII. EPA Should Clarify the \u201cPoint of Generation\u201d for Waste Determinations  \n \nThe Chamber requests that EPA clarify the point of generation for conducting a waste \ndetermination for the residue s collected from draining and/ or puncturing aerosol  cans and for non -\nintact cans.  EPA has interpreted the \u201cpoint of generation\u201d to be at both the time and place the \nwaste is initially generated and \u201cthat the [waste] determination cannot be made downstream in the \nprocess, where other materials could be mixed with the waste or where the waste may have changed \nits physical or  chemical characteristics.\u201d5  Establishing the correct point of generation for this unique \nwaste stream is critical since a generator\u2019s category is determined each month based on the amount \nof hazardous waste generated in that month.  \n \nDepending on the variety of products handled, it may be impractical to conduct a complete \nwaste determination until all the residues  have been collected and mixed.  The  Chamber suggests \nthat for r esidues collected from draining /puncturing activities, the point of generation is when the \nhandler has determined the waste stream is representative of the material that will be shipped off -\nsite. \n                                                 \n5 Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule , 81 Fed.

    "comment_text": "My name is Gustave Njapon, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Lafayette College. I write to inform the governing body that I am in favor of supporting the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule of increasing recycling by adding Aerosol cans to universal waste regulations. Aerosols are common household items as they are used to store everything from food to bathroom products to paint. The principal matter for why they are hard to recycle is that the pressurized air inside and potentially hazardous contents make recycling a bit more complicated. However from taking a Sustainable Materials course at Lafayette College, I learned about the importance of making the effort to recycle items like aerosol cans. Aerosol cans are made of either aluminum or steel, both of which are high value metals that can be infinitely recycled into new metal products. Steel recycling is very important because the manufacturing process causes steel and similar metals to have high embodied energy which is the sum of all the energy required to produce any goods or services, considered as if the energy was incorporated or embodied in the product itself. A high embodied energy energy has a negative impact on the environment due to its contribution to increase in CO2 emissions and global warming. Therefore, reducing the embodied energy can significantly reduce the environmental impact of aerosol cans. It is more important than ever that recycling be more comprehensive to allow for all sorts of items that are massively produced on a global scale. This will ultimately lead us to a more sustainable future that is better for the environment.",

    "comment_text": "Its funny you guys always say you are going to reduce costs and that the universal waste classification eases the regulatory burden. The US EPA must really not monitor the waste industry and costs associated. Universal wastes now are some of the highest costs for generators to incur. A drum of aerosol cans currently will cost around $45 for bulk customers and a typical end-user cost is about $100 per drum. Now if you make aerosols a universal waste there will be companies that will emerge and saturate the market with unqualified handlers and haulers, costs will balloon same as they did for waste bulbs and antifreeze. A drum of aerosols will increase to well over $150 per drum for the end user and proportionally for bulk generators. Please consider the safety ramifications of allowing underqualified companies to start handling hazardous pressurized cans. The key word is pressurized and this is where all of the risk comes into play. Do a quick search of fires that start or are suspected of starting from the aerosol processing, disposal, and storage areas. Almost every single fire in Michigan at Hazardous waste processing facilities is related to the aerosol processing, storage, and handling/puncture units. I will list the ones I know of in the last 15 years;\n\n1) ERG in Lovonia, MI;\n\n2) EQ in Detroit, MI\n\n3) Drug and Laboratory Disposal in Plainwell, MI;\n\n4) Phillips Service Companies (PSC) in Detroit, MI;\n\n5) Heritage Crystal Clean in Saginaw, MI\n\nand I know there have been others almost every time it is the improper handling and processing of aerosol cans\n\nThe carrier liquids and gases are almost always chemicals with high vapor pressures, are usually either acutely hazardous or flammable\n\nIf the main reason for changing this rule is costs, you greatly misunderstand the industry. The US EPA should be looking at increasing safety which this would definitely not accomplish.\n\nAnd the entire reason why the US EPA was commissioned was to protect the environment and regulate polluting materials. Gosh do a little research and you can easily see that deregulating aerosols will not only endanger more human life but vastly increase the likelihood of a fire, and/or release.\n\nLook at past examples. When universal wastes were classified a waste lamp/bulb(s) would cost about $0.40 per bulb, now it is $4-$6 per bulb in the span of only 5 years.\n\nI am a concerned citizen but I have worked in the waste industry as a chemist and senior project manager for over 20 years, and I do not work at a Michigan Hazardous Waste facility (so you would think that my impetus to write this would be in favor of deregulating hazardous materials so that my company could handle the waste, but on the contrary I do not want to take on the liability or risk. Please continue to let the Hazardous companies maintain the responsibility of aerosols, it is too risky!",

    "comment_text": "I support the proposal to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. Regulating the generation, transportation, treatment, recycling, and disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans must be considered to prevent additional hazardous waste from entering into the solid waste landfill. (Federal Register, 2018). Consideration of this proposed rule will be beneficial to the industries affected in several ways. The regulation will avoid confusion on the proper handling and disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans, it will prevent potential bodily or physical harm by reducing the likelihood of explosion, and it will prevent hazardous chemicals from entering the solid landfill thus providing a level of environmental protection. Furthermore, the proposed rule will provide significant cost savings of $3 million to $63.3 million annually. (Federal Register, 2018).\n\nIn regards to those who are affected by this proposed rule, the information states, this proposed rule making would affect persons who generate, transport, treat, recycle, or dispose of hazardous waste aerosol can, herein referred to as aerosol cans, unless those persons are households or very small quantity generators. (FedReg, 2018). It is my understanding that households do not fall under this regulation. I urge you to consider including an amendment to include regulation for the proper disposal of household hazardous waste aerosol cans and aerosol can waste recycling.\n\nMany commonly used household products are contained in aerosol cans: body care products, hair care products, sunscreens, cooking sprays, cleaning products, pesticides, paints, solvents, just to name a few. In fact, there are four billion aerosol products produced annually in the United States (Consumer Aerosol Products Council, 2017). Many people who use aerosol cans are unaware that their contents contain hazardous waste or that the empty can is recyclable. Ultimately the can and contents end up in the landfill.\n\nAerosol cans are made of aluminum and steel. These materials are non-renewable resources. However, aluminum and steel can be infinitely recycled (The Aluminum Association, 2018). American households throw $1 billion of aluminum cans into the landfill. Aluminum is easily recyclable and can directly turned back into an aluminum product after recycling (The Aluminum Association, 2018). Steel can be recycled and suffer zero degradation in performance to the recycled product (Steel Recycling Institute, 2017). The importance of recycling these non-renewable resources is invaluable in protecting our environment. The energy saved from recycling one aluminum can is enough to power the listening of an entire album on an iPod (The Aluminum Association, 2018).\n\nThe contents contained in aerosol cans may be hazardous, however the average consumer is unaware of the importance of proper disposal of hazardous materials. Including households in this regulation will provide the average aerosol consumer with the proper education to make the decision to properly dispose of the hazardous material.\n\nProviding essential education to the average consumer in regards to proper disposal of the hazardous contents of aerosol cans as well as the importance of recycling the aluminum and steel can will be beneficial to the handlers of solid waste, the environment, the steel industry, and the aluminum industry. Education of proper disposal and recycling posted on the aerosol can will provide the user with a clear and precise guideline and will also offer a reminder with each can used.\n\nIn conclusion, I support the proposed rule and encourage you to consider my suggestions of including household users in this regulation.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

    "comment_text": "Re: Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations, Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463, FRL-9975-44-OLEM\n\nMany entities will manage aerosol can puncture stations as satellite accumulation areas. Under 40 C.F.R. 262.15(a), satellite accumulation areas must be at or near any point of generation where wastes initially accumulate and under the control of the operator of the process generating the waste. I request clarification on how these rules would apply to puncture stations.\n\nFor example, assume an operator expends a can while performing a maintenance activity in a detached satellite building. The nearest puncture station is located in a separate building. The operator does not want to be interrupted, so he gives the can to another trained and authorized employee who brings the aerosol can to the puncture station and performs the puncturing. Under the corporations written policy and procedures, only employees that have been trained and specifically authorized may operate the puncturing device. All other employees in the surrounding area of the satellite accumulation area have received general environmental training and are competent to respond to spills. Environmental management personnel oversee implementation of these policies and procedures by performing periodic inspections of the areas. Any breach of these procedures is an actionable offense. Would this practice comply with the satellite accumulation area requirements?\n\nUnder this scenario, the relevant point of generation for aerosol can residue appears to be the point at which the aerosol can is punctured and the residue is drained into the hazardous waste container, not the point at which the can is expended. Under 40 C.F.R. 262.11, EPA has made clear that the point of waste generation and the point at which a hazardous waste determination is initially required is the same. See 40 C.F.R. 262.11 (requiring generators to make a hazardous waste determination at the point of waste generation, before any dilution, mixing, or other alteration of the waste occurs). Illustratively, under the proposed rule, once the aerosol can residue is drained into the container, the handler as the generator of the waste stream must conduct a hazardous waste determination on the emptied aerosol can and its contents. Id. 273.13(e)(3)(v), 273.33(e)(3)(v) (proposed). By requiring the generator to conduct a hazardous waste determination upon puncturingan act that 262.11 requires at the point of generationthe proposed rule indicates that the act of puncturing is a point of generation within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. 262.15(a). Based on this understanding, the point of generation (i.e., the puncturing apparatus) will always be at or near the satellite accumulation container (i.e., the container collecting the drained contents) provided the puncturing device is properly affixed to the drum.\n\nThe satellite accumulation area also appears be under the control of the operator. In this scenario, the operator generating the aerosol can residual waste stream would be the employee puncturing the can, not the employee expending the can. Pursuant to corporate policy, the employee that punctured the can is specifically authorized and trained to perform this function. All other employees who have not received this authorization and training are prohibited from operating the device. Moreover, environmental employees inspect the area periodically, ensuring adequate oversight is present. These measures arguably provide sufficient control over the satellite accumulation area.\n\nPlease indicate whether you agree with this regulatory interpretation. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this proposal. I look forward to your response.",

    "comment_text": "Dear Docket,\n\nIt is my belief that the addition of hazardous aerosol can waste to the universal waste program would successfully provide both incentive by awareness and ability for many people which going forward would work to greatly decrease the number of potentially dangerous and wasteful aerosol cans that are improperly disposed of in our country today. This effort aligns with both the common interest of the public for decreased impact on landfills and increased safety from the potential release of dangerous chemicals commonly remaining in such containers.\n\nThis proposal, as I understand it, would facilitate money and effort to go towards the creation of collection programs for aerosol cans--including those prone to be hazardous such as those used for paints, pesticides, and solvents among other things--which are often otherwise disposed of in landfills without being properly emptied. The pressure and dangerous contents pose problems to waste management efforts and moreover these cans are rarely recycled given lack of infrastructure that exists to facilitate this.\n\nBy adding these aerosol containers to the universal waste program, initiatives country-wide can begin to raise awareness and collect some of the estimated 3.8 billion aerosol cans that are used in the United States annually (1). The combined awareness of recycling and programs to facilitate this recycling will do our country and our future good, and protect human health and the environment, which is the self-described goal of the EPA.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration of my thoughts.\n\nDaniel Gardner, Concerned Citizen and Student of Lafayette College, Easton PA\n\nSources:\n\nU.S. EPA.

    "comment_text": "On page 11656 (2nd column) EPA, by omission, appears to be saying that an aerosol can is not D003:\n\n\"In addition, the aerosol can\n\nmay also be a hazardous waste for other\n\nreasons when discarded. More\n\nspecifically, an aerosol can may contain\n\nmaterials that exhibit hazardous\n\ncharacteristics per 40 CFR part 261\n\nsubpart C.\"\n\nAs a service to the regulated community and state agencies, EPA should specifically state whether it considers waste aerosol cans to be D003 when the cans explode upon heating.\n\nIn response to EPAs 2014 open question on the issue in it's Retail Sector NODA (2/14/14 Fed Reg at p 8929, 2nd col, and p 8934, 3rd col), one noteworthy comment (docket # EPA-HQ-RCRA-2012-0426-0052) was as follows:\n\n\"The 261.23 regulation entitled 'Characteristic of Reactivity' states at (a)(7) that 'a solid waste exhibits the characteristic of reactivity if a representative sample of the waste has any of the following properties...It is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under confinement.' Because the aerosol can still continues to function as a product (as demonstrated by it continuing to perform the important function of preventing the release of its contents to the environment), it is not a waste<<FOOTNOTE 4 ATTACHES HERE>> and therefore it is only the CONTENTS that constitute the waste. Thus it is only those contents that must be evaluated for this 261.23(a)(7) characteristic. This testing would be accomplished by placing those contents in a robust testing vessel having sufficient structural strength that it would not rupture simply as a result of the increased pressure unavoidably achieved as the temperature is raised while the contents remain confined. Only if those contents inside the test vessel detonate or undergo 'explosive reaction' would it meet 261.23(a)(7) criteria. Simple expansion due to a natural increase in pressure of the contents being tested does not constitute 'explosive reaction' or 'detonation'. (We note that if it did, discarded pure water sealed inside an ordinary tin can would need to be classified as D003 reactive hazardous waste as a consequence of the water vaporizing and the resulting steam pressure causing the can to suddenly burst open.)\n\n\"Aerosol cans are designed to safely hold their contents at ordinary temperatures and will not typically withstand the pressures achievable if they are heated, and will likely burst. But such bursting is not a valid indicator of whether the contents of an aerosol can are D003 reactive under 261.23(a)(7) because the bursting is caused by the simple physical expansion of the contents (rather than by a chemical reaction or detonation) and the subsequent structural failure of the container product that had been adequately holding those contents.\n\n\" FOOTNOTE 4 READS AS FOLLOWS: This is supported by RO# 13468, which determined that landfilled lead shielding containers are not yet solid wastes when they 'continue to fulfill this intended use,' i.e., 'as long as the shielding is fulfilling its intended use.' \"\n\nEPA should take the above EPA-HQ-RCRA-2012-0426-0052 comment into consideration and specifically state that aerosol cans which explode upon heating would not 'automatically' exhibit the D003 characteristic because the 261.23(a)(7) criteria are not 'automatically' met.",

We believe the streamlined management rules for Universal Wastes would simplify our regulated waste management procedures at our facilities and provide additional waste management options for aerosol cans while continuing to provide a framework to manage these waste streams in a safe, responsible, and compliant way.\n\nWe also propose that USEPA adopt satellite accumulation areas for aerosol cans as detailed in the Ohio Administrative Code [3745-273-09(U)]. Satellite accumulation areas for aerosol cans will reduce the burden on Universal Waste Handlers from having to date each bulk container of aerosol containers throughout a large facility and keep track of different accumulation start dates for the purposes of the one-year accumulation limit. Also, the provision may allow some Universal Waste Handlers to accumulate larger amounts of aerosol containers which may make disposal more cost effective.\n\nFord Motor Company appreciates the opportunity to comment on this proposed rulemaking and will comment on specific proposed rules once they are developed.",

    "comment_text": "I am very much in favor of this rule being implemented. If this rule were to be adopted, aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program that the EPA has implemented. This change in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) would benefit a wide variety of establishments that deal with aerosol cans, which includes both the retail sector and the waste management sector. Aerosol cans are very hazardous and have become a burden in many landfills. Even if aerosol cans are empty they still provide a threat due to their pressurized state and the potential remaining chemicals and residues still left inside the cans, even if they appear to be empty. Currently, the EPA doesnt have a national regulation stating how to properly deal with aerosol cans. They also dont provide retailers with specific guidelines on how to properly manage or dispose cans, resulting in many employees being at risk by trying to puncture cans to depressurize them or be able to dispose of them easily. This makes the issue of aerosol can disposal not only an environmental health issue but an occupational safety issue for many work places. United States manufacturing and automotive facilities alone use more than 1.6 billion aerosol cans annually according to the EPA. As you can imagine these cans usually contain hazardous materials like brake cleaners, degreasers, lubricants, and paints, all of which are hazards to our environment. Not only are these products hazardous, but many of them are also flammable, providing huge risks for landfills. If these products were to mix or explode under pressure in a landfill, massive fires could spread and lead to the emissions of huge amounts of greenhouse gases. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimates that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The Consumer Specialty Products Association also estimated that aerosol cans make up about 40% of all retail items managed as hazardous waste at large retail facilities. These statistics show the huge prevalence of these products in the United States and point to the need for a national and regulated disposal systems. If left to the individual states, many will implement helpful disposal methods, however, there will be no national guidelines and the odds are that some states will not both with such an issue. These points obviously support the need for a universal disposal program. Given their hazards to the environment and to occupational health, these policies seem necessary.\n\nHowever, potentially implementing a system to aid in retail disposal and management of aerosols could inadvertently encourage retails to produce, buy, and sell more aerosol products. Even if the EPA does create a safe way to dispose of them that potentially eases the financial burden of retailers disposing of the cans, this doesnt mean that aerosol cans in general dont provide a negative impact on the environment. Aerosols contribute greatly to an increase in cloud coverage and capture of pollutants within clouds according to NASA. NASA considers cloud coverage and the effects of differing cloud composition one of the most uncertain pieces of our changing environment. Not much is understood about the potential growing effects of aerosol particles in our air, however, researchers are just starting to see the buildup of these particles and the original estimates do not look promising for future increase of aerosols and our environment. The EPA created the WasteWise program to help aid in reduction and eventually elimination of industrial wastes such as aerosol cans. As part of this program, the EPA suggests trying to use refillable containers that use compressed air as the propellant for the material in the can. These cans are produced in both plastic and metal materials. It almost seems that making disposal more difficult for retailers and manufacturers would encourage them to utilize alternative methods like this one. However, its a hard line to walk because the United States is a long way from eliminating aerosol cans and therefore, a proper disposal method is necessary in the time being.\n\nI believe that a waste program like this is necessary and I am in favor of this ruling, however, I believe that in coordination with this, there should be an implementation of research or a potential tax for production of aerosol cans. The potential negative effects of this ruling could be dramatic and increase our air pollution greatly in the long run, but in the short term, this ruling is necessary and would aid temporarily in reducing the environmental and occupational health risks.",

Below, \nplease find PCDSW comments and questions.  \n \nComments:  \n \n1. EPA requests comment on whether to include a size limit of twenty -four ounces. It appears that \nmost aerosol can puncturing commercial devices can accommodate cans in excess of tw enty-\nfour ounces; therefore, PCDSW does not support a size limitation on aerosol cans that can be \nmanaged as universal waste.  \n \n2. The proposed amendment to 40 CFR 273.13(e)(1) states \u201cUniversal waste aerosol cans must be \naccumulated in a container\u2026\u201d.  Howeve r, the proposed amendment to 40 CFR 273.14 \nLabeling/Marking states \u201cUniversal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in \nwhich the aerosol cans are contained\u2026\u201d.  Unlike universal waste batteries, PCDSW \nrecommends aerosol cans should be required to be containerized due to their size and ability to \nroll around.  Additionally, the labeling of individual cans would be cumbersome to the business \npractice.  Therefore, in addition to requesting consistency of management standards, PCDSW \nrecomme nds containerizing be required of universal waste aerosol cans.  \n \n \n3. Through HHW Collection Facility experience, two different types of aerosol can tips were \nencountered.  One was thinner and able to be cut close to the metal, so that the materi al could \nnot be released while being stored. The other was a fatter -tipped aerosol can. This type of tip \ncould not be cut without the contents starting to spray. A consideration for two types of storage \nmay be beneficial to the health of employees, and the  transportation and storage of aerosol \ncans.  Additionally, some clarification on how to safely remove an actuator from an aerosol \ncan, similar to the specific management standards used for puncturing aerosol cans, would be \nbeneficial.  \n \n4. PCDSW concurs with  including the requirement that a puncturing device be a \u201ccommercial \ndevice specifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the residual \ncontents and any emissions thereof\u201d is, of course, quite necessary to prevent homemade de vices \nfrom being utilized and thus exposing worker to toxins and the release toxins into the \nenvironment.  \n \nQuestions:  \n \n1. 83 FR 11660 Section IV Discussion of Proposed Rule, Part A. proposes that \u201can \u2018aerosol can\u2019 \nbe defined as an intact container\u2026\u201d. However  in Part B.1., it states that the \u201cHandlers may sort \naerosol cans by type and consolidate intact aerosol cans in larger containers, remove actuators \nto reduce the risk of accidental release\u2026\u201d  Therefore if an actuator is removed, does the can \nstill meet th e proposed definition and can it still be managed as a universal waste?  \n \n2. EPA requests comment on limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not \ncommercial processors.  Since our state -authorized HHW program and CESQG/VSQG \ncollection p rogram do not receive compensation in exchange for aerosol cans, would we still be \nable to puncture and drain cans?   \n \n3. If an aerosol can contained a P -listed commercial chemical product, is the can still expected to \nbe emptied in accordance with 40 CFR 261 .7(b)(3)?  \n \n4. Is there a planned approach for inspecting the destination facilities/commercial processors?  \n \nAgain, thank you for the opportunity to participate in this rulemaking process and for your \nconsideration of the above comments.

(CP AI) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the \nproposed rulemaking titled \"Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the \nUniversal Waste Regulations\" [83 FR 11654-11667, March 16, 2018]. CPAI \nsupports the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to add hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans to the list of universal wastes regulated under the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. This proposed change, once \nfinalized, will benefit a wide variety of establishments generating and managing \naerosol cans, and lays out a clear, practical system for handling discarded aerosol \ncans. \nCP AI is the largest producer of oil in Alaska and operates several oil fields on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska. CP AI and its contractors generate significant numbers of \naerosol cans from painting, vehicle and equipment maintenance , and housekeeping \noperations. Due to the remoteness of its operations, CP AI minimizes transport of \ndiscarded aerosol cans to offsite treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs) \nas no commercial TSDFs are located in the state of Alaska. Various hazardous \nwaste codes may apply based on the type of propellant and the nature of the \nproducts. Some of these aerosol cans may be fully emptied but others may have \nmalfunctioned and are discarded with some contents remaining. We cunently \naccumulate discarded aerosol cans in satellite accumulation areas (SAAs) and \nsubsequently at \ncentral accumulation areas (CAAs) where puncturing occurs using \ndedicated commercial equipment designed for the task. Any remaining product is \nrecovered and accumulated as hazardous waste; the cans are recycled as scrap \nmetal. \nCP AI supports the classification of aerosol cans as Universal Wastes. This change \nwill not change our preferred management method of puncturing aerosol cans \nonsite, recovering any remaining product for hazardous waste disposal and \nrecycling the cans as scrap metal. We employ this strategy for aerosol cans, \nincluding those generated by our Very Small Quantity Generators (VSQGs) and \nthose classified as household hazardous wastes. We believe the streamlined \nmanagement rules for Universal Wastes will simplify regulated waste management \nprocedures at our facilities, in particular, by not requiring that aerosol cans be \ncounted toward monthly hazardous waste totals. This can be a significant benefit \nwhen a small facility is on the cusp of monthly changes to its generator status. \nEPA requests comment on establishing further limitations on puncturing and \ndraining of aerosol cans \nEPA has proposed specific management requirements for the puncturing and \ndraining of aerosol cans. These requirements in many cases reflect management \nrequirements/guidance already adopted by states that regulate this activity. CP AI \nsuggests that additional requirements beyond those that EPA specifically proposes \nare not necessary . Individual states are free to adopt more stringent requirements as \nthey see fit. \nEPA requests comment on the appropriate scope of the definition of'' aerosol can'' \nand the types of materials that should fall under it. \nEPA describes the aerosol container as follows: \"The can itself is typically a small \nsteel or aluminum container, designed to be hand-held, which is sealed with its \ncontents under pressure. The can's design is intended to prevent unwanted \nreleases of the contents to the environment under normal handling \nand storage conditions.\" [83 FR 11656] \nCP AI suggests that EPA reconsider its proposal to exclude other types of \ncontainers, including compressed gas canisters and propane cylinders . EPA \nconsiders that they present a greater risk than aerosol cans but does not elaborate \non those risks. Other small pressurized containers, in particular calibration gas \ncylinders, should also be designated as Universal Wastes as part of the final \nrulemaking. This is a logical extension of this proposal. Instead of product and \npropellant, these containers contain known concentration of product gases that are \nused to calibrate personal gas detectors, meters and analyzers used for personal \nsafety monitoring. As long as facilities have procedures in place to safely \ndepressurize these devices, potential risks can be mitigated . The procedures that \nEPA is proposing or already has in place for aerosol pesticide containers [83 FR \n11657] should adequately mitigate these risks. \nCP AI concurs that aerosol cans that meet the defmition proposed by EPA in \ngeneral can be safely managed under the Universal Waste system and that no size \nlimitation is needed. As EPA proposes, \nthese containers should be designed to be \nhand-held. \nIn addition, CP AI has the following comments and questions, \nEPA should rethink whether a \"structurally sound\" container should be \nrequired for onsite accumulation of aerosol cans in addition to requirements \nthat containers do not leak and are not damaged. \nCP AI requests that EPA verify in its preamble to the final rule that plastic \nbags can be suitable containers for discarded aerosol cans while they are \nbeing managed onsite. We have found that most spent aerosol cans are \nempty or nearly empty and that suitable plastic bags can be adequate for the \nonsite transport of these accumulated lightweight aerosol cans. These bags \nmust be of a sufficient thickness to preserve their integrity. CPAI suggests \nthat if the bags are properly closed, are compatible with the wastes contained \nin them, are able to contain leaks, and do not have rips, tears, or holes in \nthem that they are suitable containers for discarded aerosol cans, prior to \noffsite transportation. The requirement in the proposed definition [ 40 CFR \n273.13(e)(1)] that containers accumulating Universal Waste-Aerosol Cans \nbe \"structurally sound\" is unnecessary. CP AI suggests that the requirement \nfor \"structurally sound\" containers be removed or that it be clarified such \nthat a bag that retains its physical integrity \nis considered \"structurally sound\" \nwhen being managed onsite. DOT shipping requirements will dictate the \npackaging that will be required for offsite transportation . \nApplicability of the D003 (Reactivity Characteristic) \nIn the preamble to this proposed rule EPA does not mention the applicability \nD003 to waste aerosol cans. \nCP AI is aware that some states have determined that the D003 code is \napplicable to disca,rded aerosol cans. However, although EPA discusses (83 \nFR 11656) that an aerosol can might exhibit the ignitability characteristic, \nmay contain materials that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics, or may \nbe P or U-listed hazardous waste, and discusses that aerosol cans could burst \ndue to overheating, it does not specifically discuss whether the D003 \nreactivity characteristic is or is not applicable. \nCP AI encourages EPA to articulate its current position on applicability of \nD003 to discarded aerosol cans in states/territories that do not have \nauthorized RCRA programs. \nCP AI appreciates the opportunity to comment and looks forward to the \npromulgation of the final rule \nCoordinator- Advocacy and Waste \n"

    "comment_text": "This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopted, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program established by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste aerosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimated that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The CPSA also estimated that aerosol cans make up 40% of all retail items managed as hazardous waste at large retail facilities (EPA). Since this product is being so widely used it would make sense for its disposal to be regulated nationally. It would be beneficial for hazardous waste aerosol cans to be a part of this program because this program promotes the collection and recycling of all substances considered \"universal waste\", eases the burden on retailers and transporters who collect and dispose of these wastes, and encourages the development of other programs to reduce the quantity of these wastes (EPA). The universal waste program also requires that hazardous wastes are handled in a certain way in order to prevent damages to the environment. Many retailers and generators claim that it is very difficult to know what to do when they have to dispose of aerosol cans that are hazardous waste (Keller). By adding this entity to the universal waste program, retailers would have precise regulations to follow and confusion would be eliminated, since the EPA would take over in the disposal of these hazardous waste aerosol cans. With a new comprehensible and practical system, regulatory costs for these establishments who generate and manage aerosol cans would also be reduced significantly (EPA). There have been multiple states that have already successfully established their own universal waste aerosol can program. One example being California. California has on its own already established standards for who must comply with the program, requirements for handling universal waste aerosol cans, and requirements for processing these cans. California successfully established this rule change within their California Heath and Safety Code (DTSC). A few other states have also instituted this policy. Given that adding hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program could further protect the environment, provide companies with a clear and practical system for generation and disposal, and alleviate costs, there is no reason why this rule should not be instituted at a federal level regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency.",

    "comment_text": "Dear EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0001 Docket,\n\nI strongly agree that adding hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal resource Conservation and Recovery Act would be beneficial (Regulations.gov, 2018). In the Background section it stated that if aerosol cans are not managed or disposed of correctly the can may burst, releasing its contents (Regulations.gov, 2018). According to the U.S. EPA, aerosol cans can be used for dispensing various things such as pesticides and paints, so if disposed of improperly they can be a danger to public health and the environment (U.S. EPA, 2018). For example, over exposure to pesticides may be result in an increased risk in cancer (U.S. EPA, 2018). Implementing this rule would ensure that aerosol cans are sent to the appropriate facility, therefore not endangering the health of the environment or the public.\n\nAs stated in the General Information section, adding aerosol cans to the universal waste program could annually save anywhere from three million to about sixty three million dollars a year (Regualtions.gov, 2018). By implementing this rule it will not only help the environment and public, but will have a huge economic impact as well. In the book Six Degrees: Our future on a hotter planet by Mark Lynas, he states that we have less than a decade remaining to peak and begin cutting global emissions (p. 270). Therefore, I urge the EPA to add aerosol cans to the universal waste program because every little change that we can make to help save our environment will make a difference and I strongly believe that this change will be beneficial to our planet.\n\nReferences\n\nLynas, Mark.

However, because this Proposed Rule significantly impacts \nour business, Walmart submits these additional comments on its own behalf.  \n1 Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the Universal \nWaste Regulations (May 14, 2018).  \n\n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 2 of 9 Introduction   \nWalmart strives to be an environmental leader and believes everyone benefits when we \nwork with regulators to develop policies and regulations that achieve environmentally \nprotective results.  Walmart is committed to environmentally sustainable business \npractices and has been recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the \nsustainability arena.2 \nDomestically, Walmart operates more than 5,000 retail facilities, employs over 1.4 \nmillion associates, and serves over 140 million customers every week.  W almart retail \nfacilities are comprised of a mix of grocery, general merchandise, pharmacy, and \nmembership -oriented stores.  Walmart is privileged to do business in the United States \nand understands that compliance with environmental laws is a pre -requisite  to the \nsuccess and sustainability of our business.   \nAs EPA recognized in the Retail N otice of Data Availability,  significant challenges exist \nfor the Retail Sector  regarding the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\u2019s \n(\u201cRCRA \u201d) application to consumer products.3  Domestically, Walmart  sells over 100 \nbillion consumer products per year and ha s millions of different kinds of consumer \nproducts in  inventory.  Applying RCRA to all of these consumer products , when \nanalyzing waste management and disposal requirements,  is complicated , burdensome , \nand often unnecessary .4 \nWhile proud of its RCRA compliance program, Walmart believes that much of its efforts \nare largely unnecessary to protect human health and environment since the vast \nmajority of the wastes it generates are derived from common household consumer \nproducts, ma ny of which are specifically designed and regulated for safe human \nconsumption through ingestion or topical application.  By their very nature, common \nconsumer products purchased from a retail store do not pose significant risks to human \nhealth or the envi ronment.  Consumers do not want to buy products that present a \nserious danger to themselves and their families, and solid waste landfills are specifically \ndesigned to handle consumer product wastes in a manner that is protective of the \nenvironment.  While Walmart goes to extraordinary lengths to comply with the \nhazardous waste regulations of RCRA , the extraordinary lengths are required because \nthe application of RCRA\u2019s complicated regulatory scheme was not designed with \nconsumer products and the Retail Sect or in mind.  RCRA regulations, designed for \nindustrial sources, have little practical application to retail, yet as set out in the Proposed \nRule, retail is now the largest RCRA regulated industry segment.   \n                                                           \n2 Walmart has three aspirational sustainability goals: 1) Create Zero Waste; 2) Be Powered by 100% \nRenewable Energy; and 3) Sell Products that Sustain People and the Environment.  For information on \nWalmart\u2019s sustainability initiatives, accomplishments, and commitments, please visit \nwalmartsustainabilityhub.com.  \n3 EPA, Hazardous Waste Management and the Retail Sector: Providing and Seeking Information on \nPractices to Enhance Effectivene ss to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Program, Notice of \nData Availability,  79 Fed. Reg. 8926 (Feb. 14, 2014) ( \u201cNODA \u201d).  \n4 See Walmart\u2019s Comments to the NODA.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 3 of 9 Walmart appreciates EPA for recognizing the challenges faced by the R etail Sector  and \ncommends EPA for undert aking this rulemaking process.  Walmart supports EPA\u2019s \nproposal to regulate hazardous waste aerosol can s as universal wastes under RCRA.  \nWalmart believes  that, if modified as suggested in our comments, this Proposed Rule \nwill significantly advance the resource conserva tion and recovery goals of RCRA  while \nensuring that the products are managed in an environmenta lly protective manner.   \nThe universa l waste regulations include eight factors to consider in evaluating whether a \nwaste is appropria te for inclusion , including, if  the waste is generated by a wide variety \nof generators, if the waste is generated in relatively small quantities, and if risks p osed \nby the waste during accumulation and transport are relatively low compared to risks \nposed by other hazardous waste.5  While not every factor must be met for a waste to be \nappropriately regulated under the universal waste program, EPA found that waste \naerosol cans comported with each of the factors, and Walmart  agree s with EPA\u2019s \nanalysis.  \nUnfortunately , certain provisions  in the Proposed  Rule, without modification , will have a \ndeleterious impact  that severely  underm ines EPA\u2019s  goals  of sustainable materials \nmanagement  and will not achieve EPA\u2019s noted benefits  of \u201cimproved implem entation  of \nand compliance with the hazardous waste program  and increased recovery and \nrecycling of aerosol  cans .\u201d 6  Specifically , Walmart believes that  the definition  of an \naerosol can is too restrictive as is  the exclusion  of certain aerosols  from universal waste \nmanagement.  As written , Walmart  believe s these provisions  of the Proposed Rule \nerode  not only the purpose of the rule but also significantly lessen  its environmental \nbenefit.   \nAn aerosol in good condition rarely becomes waste at a retail store or in reverse \ndistribution processes.  Such cans are sold, donated, or returned to a supplier.  \nConversely, aerosol cans specifically excluded from the rule because of their condition \nare the aerosols  most  often managed as waste in the Retail S ector.  Aerosols that are \nstained, d ented, damaged,  or empty , become waste s; however, those cans are \nunnecessarily excluded from the Proposed Rule.  The end result is a Proposed Rule \nthat may in reality achieve little.   Walmart believes that is not the result EPA desires and \nhopes these comments can help the Agency rethink the definition of an aerosol and the \nexclusion ary language in the Final Rule.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n5 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 .   \n6 83 Fed. Reg. 11654, 11656 . \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 4 of 9 Background Facts Regarding Walmart and Aerosols   \nIn 2017, Walmart facilities generated approximately 4.32 million pounds7 of waste \naerosol cans .  Aerosol waste represents more than 52% of the total 8.26 million pounds \nof hazardous waste generated at all Walmart  facilities.  Currently, Walmart manages \nalmost all of these aerosols as hazardous waste  because it is difficult for employees to \ndiscern which specific aerosols are technically RCRA regulated .8  As a result, Walmart \npays a hazardous waste  service provider to remove and dispose  of a significant amount \nof aerosol cans as hazardous waste .   \nManaging aerosol  cans  as hazardous wastes costs Walmart  tens of millions of dollars \nper year .  Walmart would obviously rather send  the aerosol cans for environmentally \nbeneficial recycling  either as commercial chemical products being reclaimed or as \nuniversal waste  than to pay more money to wastefully incinerate them , especially when \nthe extra costs are not mitigat ing any risk to human health or the environment.  If the \nProposed Rule is revised as detailed below, t he ability to manage aerosol cans as \nuniversal waste will support our sustainability goals , decrease program costs, and \nsignificantly increase efficiencies related to generator status, storage space, and service \nfrequency.   In fact, i f Walmart is able to send 100% of our aerosol waste for recycling or \nreclamation , and therefore remove that waste amount from counting toward our \nhazardous waste generator status, Walmart estimate s that 83% of retail facilities will be  \nVery Small Qua ntity Generator s (VSQG ) in all months , and 97% of retail facilities will be \nVSQG in 10 or more months.    \n \nComment o n the Definition of an Aerosol Can   \nEPA is proposing to define an aerosol  can as \u201can intact  container  in which  gas under  \npressure is used to  aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a \nspray or foam .\u201d 9  Walmart  believes  that the word  \u201cintact \u201d must be removed from the \ndefinition as it is unnecessarily restrictive and ambiguous.    \nDefining an aerosol can as \u201cintact\u201d raises many questions .  Does intact mean that no \nproduct  has leaked f rom the can, or  does it mean that the cap is not broken or that the \nactuator is still in place?  Does it mean no product has been dispensed?   Is a partially \nused aerosol can \u201cintact\u201d ? In addition, \u201cintact\u201d seems superfluous, since the gas would \nnot be \u201cunder pressure\u201d if the can was not structurally intact.  In other words, there are no \n\u201cnon-intact \u201d container designs that can maintain pressure.  \n \n                                                           \n7 This weight is attributable  to almost 5 million aero sol cans . \n8 Given  the uncertainty regarding which aerosols might actually be considered RCRA waste , Walmart has \nconcluded it is less risky to manage them all as hazardo us. For example, EPA\u2019s equivocation about \nwhether aerosol cans are characteristically reactive helps explains Wal mart\u2019s conservative position.  See \nEnvironmental Law Institute , RCRA and Retail: Considering the Fate of Consumer Aerosols (May 2018) , \nAttachment 1 at 11, n . 43.   \n9 83 Fed. Reg . at 11659 -60. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 5 of 9 Given the myriad of ways \u201cintact\u201d could be interpreted and applied to aerosol cans , \nleaving this word in the definition or using a similar restrictive descriptor in EPA\u2019s \nproposed definition w ill lead to inconsistent and potentially overly exclusive application of \nthe Proposed Rule .  Additionally, EPA\u2019s focus on \u201cintact \u201d and \u201cmaintaining gas under \npressure \u201d seems misplaced for a general definition of an aerosol can .  To a retail \nassociate, a non-intact aerosol can is still an aerosol can.  It will not transform into \nsomething that is not an aerosol can simply because of nuanced differences in its \nphysical condition.  As a corollary, consider that, to most people, a \u201ctire\u201d is still a \u201ctire\u201d \nregardless of whether it has a leak or not.  The same is true for aerosol cans; minor \ndifferences in physical condition will not turn it into something else.  Therefore, the \nregulatory definition of an aerosol can, for the purposes of the Proposed Rule, should \nfocus on the design and functional elements of the can and not its current condition.     \nAs noted by EPA, four states - California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah - have \nuniversal waste aerosol programs in place .  EPA states that its proposed definition is the \nsame definition used by these States.  However , none of these States use the word \n\u201cintact \u201d or any similar conditional descriptive term in defining aerosol cans.  California, \nColorado, New Mexico, and Utah10 all define an aerosol can as \u201ca container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form \nof a spray or foam. \u201d11   \nWalmart respectfully suggests the following definition that incorporates the States\u2019 \ndefinition with revisions that allow for functional elements of aerosols: \nA container-like device designed to maintain its contents under  \npressure used to aerate or dispense material through a valve in the \nform of a gas, spray, or foam.  12 \nWalmart believes that, in order to drive consistency and remove ambiguity, EPA \nshould remove the word \u201cintact\u201d from the proposed definition of an aerosol can, and \nuse Walmart\u2019s proposed definition or at least adopt what is currently used by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah in their universal waste aerosol programs.  \nIn the alternative, Walmart also supports the Retail Associations\u2019 Comments proposing \nthat EPA adopt the aerosol definition used in international dangerous goods \nregulations.13  \n10 Utah does exclude aerosols of more than 24 ounces in its definition of an aerosol can. However, \nWalmart sees no reason for EPA to adopt that limitation. Walmart supports EPA\u2019s position to not include \na size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this Proposal, and agrees that aerosols can be safely \nmanaged under the universal waste system and are an appropriate candidate for universal waste, without \na size limitation, as indicated by EPA\u2019s application of the eight factors set out in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 . \n11 Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201. 16(a)(1) (2018); 6 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1007 -3:273.9 (2018); N.M. \nCode R. \u00a7 20.4.1.1001(A)(1)  (2018); Utah Admin. Code r.315 -273-9(a) (2018).  \n12 Walmart also added the terms \u2018or\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d between aerate and disp ense because some \ncommon aerosols, like shaving cream, may not aerate as that term is commonly understood.  Walmart \nalso added \u201cgas\u201d to the list of materials that might be dispensed to cover aerosols that dispense \ncompressed air.  \n13 See Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the \nUniversal Waste Regulations , at 14-16. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 6 of 9 Exclusion of Damaged Aerosol Cans \nThe Proposed Rule also e xcludes aerosol cans that \u201cshow evidence of leakage, spillage, \nor damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeab le conditions \u201d.14  This \nlanguage a s proposed effectively eliminates Walmart\u2019s ability to manage hazardous \nwaste aeroso ls as universal waste and provides litt le relief to the Retail Sector as a \nwhole. \nAlmost all aerosol cans become waste specifically because they have some \u201cevidence \nof leakage, spillage, or damage .\u201d  Otherwise, the product would be on the store shelf, \nreturned to the supplier, or donated.   Most waste aerosols result from customer returns \nor store damage.  Customers may spray an aerosol to make sure the actuator is \nworking or take home a can of paint to see if they like they color and then return it if they \ndo not.  In the se circumstances , there is likely to be some produ ct or paint on the \naeroso l can itself, which could be construed as evidence of leakage or spillage.  \nMoreover, aerosol caps can brea k and actuators can be clogged or removed.  Cans \nmay have dents from being dropped or knocked off shelves, and because those cans \nare no t in saleab le condition , they are removed from retail shelves.  \n14 83 Fed Reg. at 11660.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 7 of 9 \n \n \n \nEPA\u2019 s proposed language creates  unnecessary  restrictions  on aerosol s that could  be \nmanaged as universal waste and effectively undermine s the goals of the Proposed \nRule.  Again, Wa lmart submits that the current S tate programs provide sufficient  \nparame ters for the safe  manage ment  of aerosols  as universal waste and use much of \nthe same language th at EPA is proposing but without the restrictive exclusions.   \nCalifornia , Colorado , New Mexico , and Utah require universal waste  handler s to \nmanage universal waste aerosol cans in a way that prevents release of any contents or \npropellant to the environment.  Universal  waste handle rs must contain universal w aste \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 8 of 9 aerosol  cans that show evidence of  leakage , spillage, or damage  that could cause \nleakage in reasonably f oreseeable conditions .15  Universal  waste handlers are required \nto accumulate aeros ol cans in containers that are structurally  sound, compatible  with \nthe contents , and show no evidence of leaks, spills, or damage  that could cause  leaks.16  \nWalmart  submits that EPA should adopt  the reasonable approach followed by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.   \nEPA indicated in the Proposed Rule that i t was informed by waste management officials \nin these states that their programs have been  operating well and achieving their \nobjective of facilitating safe management of waste aerosol cans.   \u201cIn particular, state \nofficials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol \nuniversal waste programs have been in effect  since 2002, and they have not identified \nany problems with compliance with the standards .\u201d17  \nFurthermore, even though universal waste aerosols will not be shi pped under a \nhazardous  waste manifest, they must still be shipped in a ccord ance with Hazardous  \nMaterials  Regulations .  The Department of Transportation  requires all hazardous \nmaterial items  to be packaged to prevent leaking in transit .18  There are specific \nrequirements for shipping aerosols for recycling or disposal .19  Moreover, a erosols that \ncannot  be prevented from leaking in transit can still be shipped to a recycling or disposal \nfacility  if additional requirements are met .20  Walmart has programs in place to \ncompliantly ship aerosols.  \nWalmart believes  there  are sufficient  regulatory  safeguard s and requirements  in place \nto safely manage aerosols  that \u201cshow  evidence of leakage, spillage , or damage  that \ncould cause  leakage \u201d without  having to exclude them from being managed as universal  \nwaste.  Exclusion of  these aerosols  from universal  waste would  result in a final rule that \nprovides little benefit to the regulated community  and will result in many aerosol cans \ncontinuing to needlessly be incinerated as hazardous waste .  \nIt should be noted that r ecycling  of RCRA hazardous waste is supported by the \nindependent, non -partisan Environmental Law Institute (\u201cELI\u201d) which, in a March/April \n2018 Environment al Forum article \u201cWaste Not, Want Not \u2013 An Instruction for Regulatory \nReform ?\u201d, stated that \u201c. . . the regulatory system that has emerged and prevailed un der \nthe statute has always been preoccupied with guaranteeing proper disposal, and this \npreoccupation has at times pushed deployable secondary material toward end of life \nrather than recycling and reuse.\u201d 21  The article then highlights what is happening in  the \nretail sector with discarded aerosol cans as a prime example.  ELI amplifies this position \n                                                           \n15 Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16(e) ,(f)(1)(A);  6 Colo.

Leaving  such restrictions  in the \nFinal Rule will, in effect, promulgate a regulation  that provides no relief  for the Retail \nSector .   \nWalmart believes that the adoption of its comments would ultimately result in moving \nthe bulk of the retail industry\u2019s largest waste stream from end -of-life incineration to \nmaterial recovery and reclamation.  As discussed in the attached ELI article and wh ite \npaper, the resource recovery and smart materials management principles and \nprocesses envisioned for RCRA would be well -served by allowing the metals, \npropellant, and even some product  from waste aerosol cans  to be recovered and \nreintroduced into commer ce. The Proposed Rule, if revised, has the potential to provide \nthe Retail Sector substantial relief from application of regulations that EPA has \nacknowledged were not designed with retailers in mind while also providing substantial \nenvironmental benefit.   \nWalmart appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to this Proposed Rule and \noffers to continue to work with EPA, as appropriate, to further the Agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of the Retail Sector\u2019s challenge with the intersection of RCRA and \nconsumer produ cts.  \n \n                                                           \n22 Attachment 1. \n"

However, because this Proposed Rule significantly impacts \nour business, Walmart submits these additional comments on its own behalf.  \n1 Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the Universal \nWaste Regulations (May 14, 2018).  \n\n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 2 of 9 Introduction   \nWalmart strives to be an environmental leader and believes everyone benefits when we \nwork with regulators to develop policies and regulations that achieve environmentally \nprotective results.  Walmart is committed to environmentally sustainable business \npractices and has been recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the \nsustainability arena.2 \nDomestically, Walmart operates more than 5,000 retail facilities, employs over 1.4 \nmillion associates, and serves over 140 million customers every week.  W almart retail \nfacilities are comprised of a mix of grocery, general merchandise, pharmacy, and \nmembership -oriented stores.  Walmart is privileged to do business in the United States \nand understands that compliance with environmental laws is a pre -requisite  to the \nsuccess and sustainability of our business.   \nAs EPA recognized in the Retail N otice of Data Availability,  significant challenges exist \nfor the Retail Sector  regarding the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\u2019s \n(\u201cRCRA \u201d) application to consumer products.3  Domestically, Walmart  sells over 100 \nbillion consumer products per year and ha s millions of different kinds of consumer \nproducts in  inventory.  Applying RCRA to all of these consumer products , when \nanalyzing waste management and disposal requirements,  is complicated , burdensome , \nand often unnecessary .4 \nWhile proud of its RCRA compliance program, Walmart believes that much of its efforts \nare largely unnecessary to protect human health and environment since the vast \nmajority of the wastes it generates are derived from common household consumer \nproducts, ma ny of which are specifically designed and regulated for safe human \nconsumption through ingestion or topical application.  By their very nature, common \nconsumer products purchased from a retail store do not pose significant risks to human \nhealth or the envi ronment.  Consumers do not want to buy products that present a \nserious danger to themselves and their families, and solid waste landfills are specifically \ndesigned to handle consumer product wastes in a manner that is protective of the \nenvironment.  While Walmart goes to extraordinary lengths to comply with the \nhazardous waste regulations of RCRA , the extraordinary lengths are required because \nthe application of RCRA\u2019s complicated regulatory scheme was not designed with \nconsumer products and the Retail Sect or in mind.  RCRA regulations, designed for \nindustrial sources, have little practical application to retail, yet as set out in the Proposed \nRule, retail is now the largest RCRA regulated industry segment.   \n                                                           \n2 Walmart has three aspirational sustainability goals: 1) Create Zero Waste; 2) Be Powered by 100% \nRenewable Energy; and 3) Sell Products that Sustain People and the Environment.

Reg. 8926 (Feb. 14, 2014) ( \u201cNODA \u201d).  \n4 See Walmart\u2019s Comments to the NODA.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 3 of 9 Walmart appreciates EPA for recognizing the challenges faced by the R etail Sector  and \ncommends EPA for undert aking this rulemaking process.  Walmart supports EPA\u2019s \nproposal to regulate hazardous waste aerosol can s as universal wastes under RCRA.  \nWalmart believes  that, if modified as suggested in our comments, this Proposed Rule \nwill significantly advance the resource conserva tion and recovery goals of RCRA  while \nensuring that the products are managed in an environmenta lly protective manner.   \nThe universa l waste regulations include eight factors to consider in evaluating whether a \nwaste is appropria te for inclusion , including, if  the waste is generated by a wide variety \nof generators, if the waste is generated in relatively small quantities, and if risks p osed \nby the waste during accumulation and transport are relatively low compared to risks \nposed by other hazardous waste.5  While not every factor must be met for a waste to be \nappropriately regulated under the universal waste program, EPA found that waste \naerosol cans comported with each of the factors, and Walmart  agree s with EPA\u2019s \nanalysis.  \nUnfortunately , certain provisions  in the Proposed  Rule, without modification , will have a \ndeleterious impact  that severely  underm ines EPA\u2019s  goals  of sustainable materials \nmanagement  and will not achieve EPA\u2019s noted benefits  of \u201cimproved implem entation  of \nand compliance with the hazardous waste program  and increased recovery and \nrecycling of aerosol  cans .\u201d 6  Specifically , Walmart believes that  the definition  of an \naerosol can is too restrictive as is  the exclusion  of certain aerosols  from universal waste \nmanagement.  As written , Walmart  believe s these provisions  of the Proposed Rule \nerode  not only the purpose of the rule but also significantly lessen  its environmental \nbenefit.   \nAn aerosol in good condition rarely becomes waste at a retail store or in reverse \ndistribution processes.  Such cans are sold, donated, or returned to a supplier.  \nConversely, aerosol cans specifically excluded from the rule because of their condition \nare the aerosols  most  often managed as waste in the Retail S ector.  Aerosols that are \nstained, d ented, damaged,  or empty , become waste s; however, those cans are \nunnecessarily excluded from the Proposed Rule.  The end result is a Proposed Rule \nthat may in reality achieve little.   Walmart believes that is not the result EPA desires and \nhopes these comments can help the Agency rethink the definition of an aerosol and the \nexclusion ary language in the Final Rule.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n5 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 .   \n6 83 Fed. Reg. 11654, 11656 . \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 4 of 9 Background Facts Regarding Walmart and Aerosols   \nIn 2017, Walmart facilities generated approximately 4.32 million pounds7 of waste \naerosol cans .  Aerosol waste represents more than 52% of the total 8.26 million pounds \nof hazardous waste generated at all Walmart  facilities.  Currently, Walmart manages \nalmost all of these aerosols as hazardous waste  because it is difficult for employees to \ndiscern which specific aerosols are technically RCRA regulated .8  As a result, Walmart \npays a hazardous waste  service provider to remove and dispose  of a significant amount \nof aerosol cans as hazardous waste .   \nManaging aerosol  cans  as hazardous wastes costs Walmart  tens of millions of dollars \nper year .  Walmart would obviously rather send  the aerosol cans for environmentally \nbeneficial recycling  either as commercial chemical products being reclaimed or as \nuniversal waste  than to pay more money to wastefully incinerate them , especially when \nthe extra costs are not mitigat ing any risk to human health or the environment.  If the \nProposed Rule is revised as detailed below, t he ability to manage aerosol cans as \nuniversal waste will support our sustainability goals , decrease program costs, and \nsignificantly increase efficiencies related to generator status, storage space, and service \nfrequency.   In fact, i f Walmart is able to send 100% of our aerosol waste for recycling or \nreclamation , and therefore remove that waste amount from counting toward our \nhazardous waste generator status, Walmart estimate s that 83% of retail facilities will be  \nVery Small Qua ntity Generator s (VSQG ) in all months , and 97% of retail facilities will be \nVSQG in 10 or more months.    \n \nComment o n the Definition of an Aerosol Can   \nEPA is proposing to define an aerosol  can as \u201can intact  container  in which  gas under  \npressure is used to  aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a \nspray or foam .\u201d 9  Walmart  believes  that the word  \u201cintact \u201d must be removed from the \ndefinition as it is unnecessarily restrictive and ambiguous.    \nDefining an aerosol can as \u201cintact\u201d raises many questions .  Does intact mean that no \nproduct  has leaked f rom the can, or  does it mean that the cap is not broken or that the \nactuator is still in place?  Does it mean no product has been dispensed?   Is a partially \nused aerosol can \u201cintact\u201d ? In addition, \u201cintact\u201d seems superfluous, since the gas would \nnot be \u201cunder pressure\u201d if the can was not structurally intact.  In other words, there are no \n\u201cnon-intact \u201d container designs that can maintain pressure.  \n \n                                                           \n7 This weight is attributable  to almost 5 million aero sol cans . \n8 Given  the uncertainty regarding which aerosols might actually be considered RCRA waste , Walmart has \nconcluded it is less risky to manage them all as hazardo us. For example, EPA\u2019s equivocation about \nwhether aerosol cans are characteristically reactive helps explains Wal mart\u2019s conservative position.  See \nEnvironmental Law Institute , RCRA and Retail: Considering the Fate of Consumer Aerosols (May 2018) , \nAttachment 1 at 11, n . 43.   \n9 83 Fed. Reg . at 11659 -60. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 5 of 9 Given the myriad of ways \u201cintact\u201d could be interpreted and applied to aerosol cans , \nleaving this word in the definition or using a similar restrictive descriptor in EPA\u2019s \nproposed definition w ill lead to inconsistent and potentially overly exclusive application of \nthe Proposed Rule .  Additionally, EPA\u2019s focus on \u201cintact \u201d and \u201cmaintaining gas under \npressure \u201d seems misplaced for a general definition of an aerosol can .  To a retail \nassociate, a non-intact aerosol can is still an aerosol can.  It will not transform into \nsomething that is not an aerosol can simply because of nuanced differences in its \nphysical condition.  As a corollary, consider that, to most people, a \u201ctire\u201d is still a \u201ctire\u201d \nregardless of whether it has a leak or not.  The same is true for aerosol cans; minor \ndifferences in physical condition will not turn it into something else.  Therefore, the \nregulatory definition of an aerosol can, for the purposes of the Proposed Rule, should \nfocus on the design and functional elements of the can and not its current condition.     \nAs noted by EPA, four states - California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah - have \nuniversal waste aerosol programs in place .  EPA states that its proposed definition is the \nsame definition used by these States.  However , none of these States use the word \n\u201cintact \u201d or any similar conditional descriptive term in defining aerosol cans.  California, \nColorado, New Mexico, and Utah10 all define an aerosol can as \u201ca container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form \nof a spray or foam. \u201d11   \nWalmart respectfully suggests the following definition that incorporates the States\u2019 \ndefinition with revisions that allow for functional elements of aerosols: \nA container-like device designed to maintain its contents under  \npressure used to aerate or dispense material through a valve in the \nform of a gas, spray, or foam.  12 \nWalmart believes that, in order to drive consistency and remove ambiguity, EPA \nshould remove the word \u201cintact\u201d from the proposed definition of an aerosol can, and \nuse Walmart\u2019s proposed definition or at least adopt what is currently used by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah in their universal waste aerosol programs.  \nIn the alternative, Walmart also supports the Retail Associations\u2019 Comments proposing \nthat EPA adopt the aerosol definition used in international dangerous goods \nregulations.13  \n10 Utah does exclude aerosols of more than 24 ounces in its definition of an aerosol can. However, \nWalmart sees no reason for EPA to adopt that limitation. Walmart supports EPA\u2019s position to not include \na size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this Proposal, and agrees that aerosols can be safely \nmanaged under the universal waste system and are an appropriate candidate for universal waste, without \na size limitation, as indicated by EPA\u2019s application of the eight factors set out in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 . \n11 Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201. 16(a)(1) (2018); 6 Colo. Code Regs. \u00a7 1007 -3:273.9 (2018); N.M. \nCode R. \u00a7 20.4.1.1001(A)(1)  (2018); Utah Admin. Code r.315 -273-9(a) (2018).  \n12 Walmart also added the terms \u2018or\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d between aerate and disp ense because some \ncommon aerosols, like shaving cream, may not aerate as that term is commonly understood.  Walmart \nalso added \u201cgas\u201d to the list of materials that might be dispensed to cover aerosols that dispense \ncompressed air.  \n13 See Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the \nUniversal Waste Regulations , at 14-16. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 6 of 9 Exclusion of Damaged Aerosol Cans \nThe Proposed Rule also e xcludes aerosol cans that \u201cshow evidence of leakage, spillage, \nor damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeab le conditions \u201d.14  This \nlanguage a s proposed effectively eliminates Walmart\u2019s ability to manage hazardous \nwaste aeroso ls as universal waste and provides litt le relief to the Retail Sector as a \nwhole. \nAlmost all aerosol cans become waste specifically because they have some \u201cevidence \nof leakage, spillage, or damage .\u201d  Otherwise, the product would be on the store shelf, \nreturned to the supplier, or donated.   Most waste aerosols result from customer returns \nor store damage.  Customers may spray an aerosol to make sure the actuator is \nworking or take home a can of paint to see if they like they color and then return it if they \ndo not.  In the se circumstances , there is likely to be some produ ct or paint on the \naeroso l can itself, which could be construed as evidence of leakage or spillage.  \nMoreover, aerosol caps can brea k and actuators can be clogged or removed.  Cans \nmay have dents from being dropped or knocked off shelves, and because those cans \nare no t in saleab le condition , they are removed from retail shelves.  \n14 83 Fed Reg. at 11660.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 7 of 9 \n \n \n \nEPA\u2019 s proposed language creates  unnecessary  restrictions  on aerosol s that could  be \nmanaged as universal waste and effectively undermine s the goals of the Proposed \nRule.  Again, Wa lmart submits that the current S tate programs provide sufficient  \nparame ters for the safe  manage ment  of aerosols  as universal waste and use much of \nthe same language th at EPA is proposing but without the restrictive exclusions.   \nCalifornia , Colorado , New Mexico , and Utah require universal waste  handler s to \nmanage universal waste aerosol cans in a way that prevents release of any contents or \npropellant to the environment.  Universal  waste handle rs must contain universal w aste \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 8 of 9 aerosol  cans that show evidence of  leakage , spillage, or damage  that could cause \nleakage in reasonably f oreseeable conditions .15  Universal  waste handlers are required \nto accumulate aeros ol cans in containers that are structurally  sound, compatible  with \nthe contents , and show no evidence of leaks, spills, or damage  that could cause  leaks.16  \nWalmart  submits that EPA should adopt  the reasonable approach followed by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.   \nEPA indicated in the Proposed Rule that i t was informed by waste management officials \nin these states that their programs have been  operating well and achieving their \nobjective of facilitating safe management of waste aerosol cans.   \u201cIn particular, state \nofficials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol \nuniversal waste programs have been in effect  since 2002, and they have not identified \nany problems with compliance with the standards .\u201d17  \nFurthermore, even though universal waste aerosols will not be shi pped under a \nhazardous  waste manifest, they must still be shipped in a ccord ance with Hazardous  \nMaterials  Regulations .  The Department of Transportation  requires all hazardous \nmaterial items  to be packaged to prevent leaking in transit .18  There are specific \nrequirements for shipping aerosols for recycling or disposal .19  Moreover, a erosols that \ncannot  be prevented from leaking in transit can still be shipped to a recycling or disposal \nfacility  if additional requirements are met .20  Walmart has programs in place to \ncompliantly ship aerosols.  \nWalmart believes  there  are sufficient  regulatory  safeguard s and requirements  in place \nto safely manage aerosols  that \u201cshow  evidence of leakage, spillage , or damage  that \ncould cause  leakage \u201d without  having to exclude them from being managed as universal  \nwaste.  Exclusion of  these aerosols  from universal  waste would  result in a final rule that \nprovides little benefit to the regulated community  and will result in many aerosol cans \ncontinuing to needlessly be incinerated as hazardous waste .  \nIt should be noted that r ecycling  of RCRA hazardous waste is supported by the \nindependent, non -partisan Environmental Law Institute (\u201cELI\u201d) which, in a March/April \n2018 Environment al Forum article \u201cWaste Not, Want Not \u2013 An Instruction for Regulatory \nReform ?\u201d, stated that \u201c. . . the regulatory system that has emerged and prevailed un der \nthe statute has always been preoccupied with guaranteeing proper disposal, and this \npreoccupation has at times pushed deployable secondary material toward end of life \nrather than recycling and reuse.\u201d 21  The article then highlights what is happening in  the \nretail sector with discarded aerosol cans as a prime example.  ELI amplifies this position \n                                                           \n15 Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16(e) ,(f)(1)(A);  6 Colo.

Leaving  such restrictions  in the \nFinal Rule will, in effect, promulgate a regulation  that provides no relief  for the Retail \nSector .   \nWalmart believes that the adoption of its comments would ultimately result in moving \nthe bulk of the retail industry\u2019s largest waste stream from end -of-life incineration to \nmaterial recovery and reclamation.  As discussed in the attached ELI article and wh ite \npaper, the resource recovery and smart materials management principles and \nprocesses envisioned for RCRA would be well -served by allowing the metals, \npropellant, and even some product  from waste aerosol cans  to be recovered and \nreintroduced into commer ce. The Proposed Rule, if revised, has the potential to provide \nthe Retail Sector substantial relief from application of regulations that EPA has \nacknowledged were not designed with retailers in mind while also providing substantial \nenvironmental benefit.   \nWalmart appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to this Proposed Rule and \noffers to continue to work with EPA, as appropriate, to further the Agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of the Retail Sector\u2019s challenge with the intersection of RCRA and \nconsumer produ cts.  \n \n                                                           \n22 Attachment 1. \n"

However, because this Proposed Rule significantly impacts \nour business, Walmart submits these additional comments on its own behalf.  \n1 Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the Universal \nWaste Regulations (May 14, 2018).  \n\n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 2 of 9 Introduction   \nWalmart strives to be an environmental leader and believes everyone benefits when we \nwork with regulators to develop policies and regulations that achieve environmentally \nprotective results.  Walmart is committed to environmentally sustainable business \npractices and has been recognized as one of the world\u2019s leading companies in the \nsustainability arena.2 \nDomestically, Walmart operates more than 5,000 retail facilities, employs over 1.4 \nmillion associates, and serves over 140 million customers every week.  W almart retail \nfacilities are comprised of a mix of grocery, general merchandise, pharmacy, and \nmembership -oriented stores.  Walmart is privileged to do business in the United States \nand understands that compliance with environmental laws is a pre -requisite  to the \nsuccess and sustainability of our business.   \nAs EPA recognized in the Retail N otice of Data Availability,  significant challenges exist \nfor the Retail Sector  regarding the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act\u2019s \n(\u201cRCRA \u201d) application to consumer products.3  Domestically, Walmart  sells over 100 \nbillion consumer products per year and ha s millions of different kinds of consumer \nproducts in  inventory.  Applying RCRA to all of these consumer products , when \nanalyzing waste management and disposal requirements,  is complicated , burdensome , \nand often unnecessary .4 \nWhile proud of its RCRA compliance program, Walmart believes that much of its efforts \nare largely unnecessary to protect human health and environment since the vast \nmajority of the wastes it generates are derived from common household consumer \nproducts, ma ny of which are specifically designed and regulated for safe human \nconsumption through ingestion or topical application.  By their very nature, common \nconsumer products purchased from a retail store do not pose significant risks to human \nhealth or the envi ronment.  Consumers do not want to buy products that present a \nserious danger to themselves and their families, and solid waste landfills are specifically \ndesigned to handle consumer product wastes in a manner that is protective of the \nenvironment.  While Walmart goes to extraordinary lengths to comply with the \nhazardous waste regulations of RCRA , the extraordinary lengths are required because \nthe application of RCRA\u2019s complicated regulatory scheme was not designed with \nconsumer products and the Retail Sect or in mind.  RCRA regulations, designed for \nindustrial sources, have little practical application to retail, yet as set out in the Proposed \nRule, retail is now the largest RCRA regulated industry segment.   \n                                                           \n2 Walmart has three aspirational sustainability goals: 1) Create Zero Waste; 2) Be Powered by 100% \nRenewable Energy; and 3) Sell Products that Sustain People and the Environment.  For information on \nWalmart\u2019s sustainability initiatives, accomplishments, and commitments, please visit \nwalmartsustainabilityhub.com.  \n3 EPA, Hazardous Waste Management and the Retail Sector: Providing and Seeking Information on \nPractices to Enhance Effectivene ss to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Program, Notice of \nData Availability,  79 Fed. Reg. 8926 (Feb. 14, 2014) ( \u201cNODA \u201d).  \n4 See Walmart\u2019s Comments to the NODA.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 3 of 9 Walmart appreciates EPA for recognizing the challenges faced by the R etail Sector  and \ncommends EPA for undert aking this rulemaking process.  Walmart supports EPA\u2019s \nproposal to regulate hazardous waste aerosol can s as universal wastes under RCRA.  \nWalmart believes  that, if modified as suggested in our comments, this Proposed Rule \nwill significantly advance the resource conserva tion and recovery goals of RCRA  while \nensuring that the products are managed in an environmenta lly protective manner.   \nThe universa l waste regulations include eight factors to consider in evaluating whether a \nwaste is appropria te for inclusion , including, if  the waste is generated by a wide variety \nof generators, if the waste is generated in relatively small quantities, and if risks p osed \nby the waste during accumulation and transport are relatively low compared to risks \nposed by other hazardous waste.5  While not every factor must be met for a waste to be \nappropriately regulated under the universal waste program, EPA found that waste \naerosol cans comported with each of the factors, and Walmart  agree s with EPA\u2019s \nanalysis.  \nUnfortunately , certain provisions  in the Proposed  Rule, without modification , will have a \ndeleterious impact  that severely  underm ines EPA\u2019s  goals  of sustainable materials \nmanagement  and will not achieve EPA\u2019s noted benefits  of \u201cimproved implem entation  of \nand compliance with the hazardous waste program  and increased recovery and \nrecycling of aerosol  cans .\u201d 6  Specifically , Walmart believes that  the definition  of an \naerosol can is too restrictive as is  the exclusion  of certain aerosols  from universal waste \nmanagement.  As written , Walmart  believe s these provisions  of the Proposed Rule \nerode  not only the purpose of the rule but also significantly lessen  its environmental \nbenefit.   \nAn aerosol in good condition rarely becomes waste at a retail store or in reverse \ndistribution processes.  Such cans are sold, donated, or returned to a supplier.  \nConversely, aerosol cans specifically excluded from the rule because of their condition \nare the aerosols  most  often managed as waste in the Retail S ector.  Aerosols that are \nstained, d ented, damaged,  or empty , become waste s; however, those cans are \nunnecessarily excluded from the Proposed Rule.  The end result is a Proposed Rule \nthat may in reality achieve little.   Walmart believes that is not the result EPA desires and \nhopes these comments can help the Agency rethink the definition of an aerosol and the \nexclusion ary language in the Final Rule.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n5 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 .   \n6 83 Fed. Reg. 11654, 11656 . \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 4 of 9 Background Facts Regarding Walmart and Aerosols   \nIn 2017, Walmart facilities generated approximately 4.32 million pounds7 of waste \naerosol cans .  Aerosol waste represents more than 52% of the total 8.26 million pounds \nof hazardous waste generated at all Walmart  facilities.  Currently, Walmart manages \nalmost all of these aerosols as hazardous waste  because it is difficult for employees to \ndiscern which specific aerosols are technically RCRA regulated .8  As a result, Walmart \npays a hazardous waste  service provider to remove and dispose  of a significant amount \nof aerosol cans as hazardous waste .   \nManaging aerosol  cans  as hazardous wastes costs Walmart  tens of millions of dollars \nper year .  Walmart would obviously rather send  the aerosol cans for environmentally \nbeneficial recycling  either as commercial chemical products being reclaimed or as \nuniversal waste  than to pay more money to wastefully incinerate them , especially when \nthe extra costs are not mitigat ing any risk to human health or the environment.  If the \nProposed Rule is revised as detailed below, t he ability to manage aerosol cans as \nuniversal waste will support our sustainability goals , decrease program costs, and \nsignificantly increase efficiencies related to generator status, storage space, and service \nfrequency.   In fact, i f Walmart is able to send 100% of our aerosol waste for recycling or \nreclamation , and therefore remove that waste amount from counting toward our \nhazardous waste generator status, Walmart estimate s that 83% of retail facilities will be  \nVery Small Qua ntity Generator s (VSQG ) in all months , and 97% of retail facilities will be \nVSQG in 10 or more months.    \n \nComment o n the Definition of an Aerosol Can   \nEPA is proposing to define an aerosol  can as \u201can intact  container  in which  gas under  \npressure is used to  aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a \nspray or foam .\u201d 9  Walmart  believes  that the word  \u201cintact \u201d must be removed from the \ndefinition as it is unnecessarily restrictive and ambiguous.    \nDefining an aerosol can as \u201cintact\u201d raises many questions .  Does intact mean that no \nproduct  has leaked f rom the can, or  does it mean that the cap is not broken or that the \nactuator is still in place?  Does it mean no product has been dispensed?   Is a partially \nused aerosol can \u201cintact\u201d ? In addition, \u201cintact\u201d seems superfluous, since the gas would \nnot be \u201cunder pressure\u201d if the can was not structurally intact.  In other words, there are no \n\u201cnon-intact \u201d container designs that can maintain pressure.  \n \n                                                           \n7 This weight is attributable  to almost 5 million aero sol cans . \n8 Given  the uncertainty regarding which aerosols might actually be considered RCRA waste , Walmart has \nconcluded it is less risky to manage them all as hazardo us. For example, EPA\u2019s equivocation about \nwhether aerosol cans are characteristically reactive helps explains Wal mart\u2019s conservative position.  See \nEnvironmental Law Institute , RCRA and Retail: Considering the Fate of Consumer Aerosols (May 2018) , \nAttachment 1 at 11, n . 43.   \n9 83 Fed. Reg . at 11659 -60. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 5 of 9 Given the myriad of ways \u201cintact\u201d could be interpreted and applied to aerosol cans , \nleaving this word in the definition or using a similar restrictive descriptor in EPA\u2019s \nproposed definition w ill lead to inconsistent and potentially overly exclusive application of \nthe Proposed Rule .  Additionally, EPA\u2019s focus on \u201cintact \u201d and \u201cmaintaining gas under \npressure \u201d seems misplaced for a general definition of an aerosol can .  To a retail \nassociate, a non-intact aerosol can is still an aerosol can.  It will not transform into \nsomething that is not an aerosol can simply because of nuanced differences in its \nphysical condition.  As a corollary, consider that, to most people, a \u201ctire\u201d is still a \u201ctire\u201d \nregardless of whether it has a leak or not.  The same is true for aerosol cans; minor \ndifferences in physical condition will not turn it into something else.  Therefore, the \nregulatory definition of an aerosol can, for the purposes of the Proposed Rule, should \nfocus on the design and functional elements of the can and not its current condition.     \nAs noted by EPA, four states - California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah - have \nuniversal waste aerosol programs in place .  EPA states that its proposed definition is the \nsame definition used by these States.  However , none of these States use the word \n\u201cintact \u201d or any similar conditional descriptive term in defining aerosol cans.  California, \nColorado, New Mexico, and Utah10 all define an aerosol can as \u201ca container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form \nof a spray or foam. \u201d11   \nWalmart respectfully suggests the following definition that incorporates the States\u2019 \ndefinition with revisions that allow for functional elements of aerosols: \nA container-like device designed to maintain its contents under  \npressure used to aerate or dispense material through a valve in the \nform of a gas, spray, or foam.  12 \nWalmart believes that, in order to drive consistency and remove ambiguity, EPA \nshould remove the word \u201cintact\u201d from the proposed definition of an aerosol can, and \nuse Walmart\u2019s proposed definition or at least adopt what is currently used by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah in their universal waste aerosol programs.  \nIn the alternative, Walmart also supports the Retail Associations\u2019 Comments proposing \nthat EPA adopt the aerosol definition used in international dangerous goods \nregulations.13  \n10 Utah does exclude aerosols of more than 24 ounces in its definition of an aerosol can. However, \nWalmart sees no reason for EPA to adopt that limitation. Walmart supports EPA\u2019s position to not include \na size limitation on universal waste aerosol cans in this Proposal, and agrees that aerosols can be safely \nmanaged under the universal waste system and are an appropriate candidate for universal waste, without \na size limitation, as indicated by EPA\u2019s application of the eight factors set out in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7273.81 . \n11 Cal.

Code r.315 -273-9(a) (2018).  \n12 Walmart also added the terms \u2018or\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d between aerate and disp ense because some \ncommon aerosols, like shaving cream, may not aerate as that term is commonly understood.  Walmart \nalso added \u201cgas\u201d to the list of materials that might be dispensed to cover aerosols that dispense \ncompressed air.  \n13 See Comments of the Retail Associations on EPA\u2019s Proposal to Add Aerosol Can Wastes to the \nUniversal Waste Regulations , at 14-16. \nMay 15, 2018 Page 6 of 9 Exclusion of Damaged Aerosol Cans \nThe Proposed Rule also e xcludes aerosol cans that \u201cshow evidence of leakage, spillage, \nor damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeab le conditions \u201d.14  This \nlanguage a s proposed effectively eliminates Walmart\u2019s ability to manage hazardous \nwaste aeroso ls as universal waste and provides litt le relief to the Retail Sector as a \nwhole. \nAlmost all aerosol cans become waste specifically because they have some \u201cevidence \nof leakage, spillage, or damage .\u201d  Otherwise, the product would be on the store shelf, \nreturned to the supplier, or donated.   Most waste aerosols result from customer returns \nor store damage.  Customers may spray an aerosol to make sure the actuator is \nworking or take home a can of paint to see if they like they color and then return it if they \ndo not.  In the se circumstances , there is likely to be some produ ct or paint on the \naeroso l can itself, which could be construed as evidence of leakage or spillage.  \nMoreover, aerosol caps can brea k and actuators can be clogged or removed.  Cans \nmay have dents from being dropped or knocked off shelves, and because those cans \nare no t in saleab le condition , they are removed from retail shelves.  \n14 83 Fed Reg. at 11660.  \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 7 of 9 \n \n \n \nEPA\u2019 s proposed language creates  unnecessary  restrictions  on aerosol s that could  be \nmanaged as universal waste and effectively undermine s the goals of the Proposed \nRule.  Again, Wa lmart submits that the current S tate programs provide sufficient  \nparame ters for the safe  manage ment  of aerosols  as universal waste and use much of \nthe same language th at EPA is proposing but without the restrictive exclusions.   \nCalifornia , Colorado , New Mexico , and Utah require universal waste  handler s to \nmanage universal waste aerosol cans in a way that prevents release of any contents or \npropellant to the environment.  Universal  waste handle rs must contain universal w aste \n \nMay 15, 2018   Page 8 of 9 aerosol  cans that show evidence of  leakage , spillage, or damage  that could cause \nleakage in reasonably f oreseeable conditions .15  Universal  waste handlers are required \nto accumulate aeros ol cans in containers that are structurally  sound, compatible  with \nthe contents , and show no evidence of leaks, spills, or damage  that could cause  leaks.16  \nWalmart  submits that EPA should adopt  the reasonable approach followed by \nCalifornia, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah.   \nEPA indicated in the Proposed Rule that i t was informed by waste management officials \nin these states that their programs have been  operating well and achieving their \nobjective of facilitating safe management of waste aerosol cans.   \u201cIn particular, state \nofficials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol \nuniversal waste programs have been in effect  since 2002, and they have not identified \nany problems with compliance with the standards .\u201d17  \nFurthermore, even though universal waste aerosols will not be shi pped under a \nhazardous  waste manifest, they must still be shipped in a ccord ance with Hazardous  \nMaterials  Regulations .  The Department of Transportation  requires all hazardous \nmaterial items  to be packaged to prevent leaking in transit .18  There are specific \nrequirements for shipping aerosols for recycling or disposal .19  Moreover, a erosols that \ncannot  be prevented from leaking in transit can still be shipped to a recycling or disposal \nfacility  if additional requirements are met .20  Walmart has programs in place to \ncompliantly ship aerosols.  \nWalmart believes  there  are sufficient  regulatory  safeguard s and requirements  in place \nto safely manage aerosols  that \u201cshow  evidence of leakage, spillage , or damage  that \ncould cause  leakage \u201d without  having to exclude them from being managed as universal  \nwaste.  Exclusion of  these aerosols  from universal  waste would  result in a final rule that \nprovides little benefit to the regulated community  and will result in many aerosol cans \ncontinuing to needlessly be incinerated as hazardous waste .  \nIt should be noted that r ecycling  of RCRA hazardous waste is supported by the \nindependent, non -partisan Environmental Law Institute (\u201cELI\u201d) which, in a March/April \n2018 Environment al Forum article \u201cWaste Not, Want Not \u2013 An Instruction for Regulatory \nReform ?\u201d, stated that \u201c. . . the regulatory system that has emerged and prevailed un der \nthe statute has always been preoccupied with guaranteeing proper disposal, and this \npreoccupation has at times pushed deployable secondary material toward end of life \nrather than recycling and reuse.\u201d 21  The article then highlights what is happening in  the \nretail sector with discarded aerosol cans as a prime example.  ELI amplifies this position \n                                                           \n15 Cal. Health & Safety Code \u00a7 25201.16(e) ,(f)(1)(A);  6 Colo.

Leaving  such restrictions  in the \nFinal Rule will, in effect, promulgate a regulation  that provides no relief  for the Retail \nSector .   \nWalmart believes that the adoption of its comments would ultimately result in moving \nthe bulk of the retail industry\u2019s largest waste stream from end -of-life incineration to \nmaterial recovery and reclamation.  As discussed in the attached ELI article and wh ite \npaper, the resource recovery and smart materials management principles and \nprocesses envisioned for RCRA would be well -served by allowing the metals, \npropellant, and even some product  from waste aerosol cans  to be recovered and \nreintroduced into commer ce. The Proposed Rule, if revised, has the potential to provide \nthe Retail Sector substantial relief from application of regulations that EPA has \nacknowledged were not designed with retailers in mind while also providing substantial \nenvironmental benefit.   \nWalmart appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to this Proposed Rule and \noffers to continue to work with EPA, as appropriate, to further the Agency\u2019s \nunderstanding of the Retail Sector\u2019s challenge with the intersection of RCRA and \nconsumer produ cts.  \n \n                                                           \n22 Attachment 1. \n"

However, CT DEEP \nhas a number of comments on the proposed rule, which are d etailed in the following numbered \nsections.  \n \n1.) Comment on EPA\u2019s Assumption that Eligible States Would Adopt the Aerosol Can Rule \nWhen Final.  In Section I.D. of the proposed rule preamble, EPA requests comment on its \nassumption that states would adopt the aerosol can rule if it were to become final. As noted above, CT DEEP generally supports the proposed rule, and barring any major adverse changes to the proposed rule, would be inclined to adopt such a rule if it were made final.  However, as with other optional EPA rule s, CT DEEP would evaluate \nadoption in light of available resources and competin g priorities and consideration for \nwhether  cer tain more stringent or broader -in-scope provisions  are necessary to protect \nhuman health and the environment in Connecticut. \n \n2.) Comment on definition of \u201caerosol can.\u201d   In Section II.A. of the proposed rule preamble, \nEPA provides a description of aerosol ca ns in general.  EPA also discusses its proposed \ndefinition of aerosol cans in Section IV.A. of the proposed rule preamble.  CT DEEP \nurges EPA to either amend the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d or provide a clarification in the final rule preamble as to whethe r or not certain types of pressurized containers other than \ntypical aerosol containers would meet the definition of an \u201caerosol can,\u201d including but not limited to the following types of containers:  \n \na. Pharmaceutical products that are delivered in the form of  a spray or mist.  These \ncan include  spray sunscreen products, topical anesthetics such as benzocaine, \nethyl chloride, or \u201cFluori -Methane,\u201d and products packaged in inhalers.  Some of \nPage 2 of 7 \n \nthese products contain hazardous ingredients, others may contain hazardous propellants.  Although they may be much smaller than a typical aerosol can, these devices function in essentially the same manner, and CT DEEP believes that EPA should clarify  the status of these products under the proposed Universal Waste \nrule changes,  particularly in light of EPA\u2019s anticipated rulemaking with respect to \nhazardous pharmaceuticals.  Such a clarification would help to avoid confusion over which set of requirements such devices should (or may) be managed.  \n \nb. Pepper -spray containers , such as those  used for crowd control or self -defense by \nlaw enforcement agencies .  CT DEEP has received several inquiries about how \nthese devices should be managed.  This is particularly a concern for law enforcement agencies since these devices have a limited shelf life, and  such \nagencies find themselves having to dispose of large numbers of unused pepper spray containers that have exceeded their shelf lives.   Some of these devices \nutilize flammable propellants and would be regulated as hazardous waste when dispos ed.  CT DEEP believes that these devices should be considered to be \n\u201caerosol cans .\u201d  Like the containers  described above, the se device function in \nessentially the same manner as more typical aerosol cans.  \n \nc. Spray foam insulation kits, such as the kinds available at home improvement \nstores.   These units are often quite large in size (up to several gallons).  Because \nof their large size, and because of the potential problems they would cause with aerosol can puncturing devices (e.g. foaming up inside  the d rained liquids \ncollection container, or plugging up the puncturing device), CT DEEP believes that these foam insulation kits should not be considered to be \u201caerosol cans.\u201d  \n \n3.) Expected Changes in the Management of Aerosol Cans.  In Section III.B. of the proposed \nrule preamble, EPA describes the kinds of changes it expects the proposed rule would make with respect to the management of aerosol cans  (e.g., increased diversion from \nmunicipal solid waste landfills and incinerators ).  CT DEEP agrees with EPA\u2019s \nasses sment of these changes, and believes that the proposed rule would also have the \nfollowing environmentally -beneficial effects:  \n \na. Generators Would Be Likely to Co- Manage Both Hazardous and Non -Hazardous \nAerosol Cans if the Proposed Rule Were to Become Final.   Many generators of \naerosol cans use a wide variety of aerosol products, some of which may be hazardous and some of which may not be hazardous.  In addition, it is often difficult or time -consuming for such generators to segregate hazardous from  non-\nhazar dous at the point of disposal.  Furthermore, generators of a wide variety of \naerosol cans may find it difficult to ensure that on -site staff properly manage \nhazardous vs. non- hazardous waste aerosol cans.  As a result, DEEP believes that \nmany such generators would be inclined to manage all  of their waste aerosol cans \nas Universal Waste (i.e., both the hazardous and non- hazardous ones), since this \napproach would be the simplest one to implement at their site,  would ensure that \nall types of aerosol cans are p roperly disposed of, and at the same time would be \nstill be economically feasible under the Universal Waste rule.  \n  \nPage 3 of 7 \n \nb. Generators Would Also Be Likely to Co- Manage Both Empty an d Full Aerosol \nCans if the Proposed Rule Were to Become Final.   It can often be di fficult to \nconfirm if an aerosol can is \u201cempty\u201d and therefore exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste pursuant to 40 CFR 261.7.  For example, the nozzle may clog, leaving a certain amount of the liquid, solid , and/or gaseous  contents inside the \ncan.  As a result, CT DEEP believes that many generators of \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans \nwill opt to manage them under the proposed Universal Waste requirements even though they would not be required to do so.  Doing this would also provide consistency for facility staff  that generate empty aerosol cans, and serve to \nprevent non- empty cans from ending up in the solid waste stream, while at the \nsame time being economically feasible under the Universal Waste rule.  \n \nCT DEEP notes that it is aware of some generators in Connec ticut that are already \nengaging in either or both of the practices described above, and believes  that such \npractices would only become more common  if the proposed rule were made final, owing \nto the reduced costs afforded by the ability to manage waste aerosol cans as Universal Waste as opposed to fully -regulated hazardous waste.  \n \n4.) EPA Should Adopt a Maximum Volume for Aerosol Cans.  In section IV.A. of the \npreamble, EPA notes that it did not set a limitation on the size of aerosol cans eligible for management as Universal Waste under the proposed rule.  EPA also notes that the State of Utah s et a limit of 24 ounces in that  state\u2019s Universal Waste desi gnation for aerosol \ncans.  EPA solicits comment on whether or not the federal rule should include a similar provision.  In response, CT DEEP believes that EPA should set such a  volume  limit, and \nthat Utah\u2019s 24 ounce limit would be an appropriate limit for a  number of reasons.  In \nparticular, the 24 -ounce number would capture the vast majority of devices ordinarily \nthought of as \u201caerosol cans,\u201d and would exclude some potentially problematic devices such as the spray foam insulation kits described in comment 2.c. above.  \n \n5.) EPA Should Consider Adding a Requirement to Prevent Discharge of Propellant Gases \nfrom  Aerosol Cans During Storage.  In Section IV.B.1. of the proposed rule preamble, \nEPA discusses the requirements it is proposing with respect to the management of aerosol cans, including requirements to prevent fires and releases.  While CT DEEP supports these requirements, it is concerned that they may not go far enough with respect to addressing a particular scenario that is likely to result in releases  of pr opellant gases, \nwhich can be highly ignitable or flammable.  In particular, generators of aerosol cans often store them loose ly inside larger containers such as 55 -gallon drums.  If the aerosol \ncan nozzles are not removed, or caps are not secured in place on the tops of the aerosol cans, there is the possibility that a nozzle could be depressed or deflected by other cans in the outer container, causing the discharge of the contents of the can.  This could occur randomly and unpredictably as the result of jostling of the loose cans during storage or transportation.  Such releases could cause the build- up of combustible gases and result in \na fire or explosion hazard.  This issue is similar to the issue of securing battery terminals when shipping loose batterie s in containers.  US DOT requires such batteries over 9 volts \nto be in a separate container or have the terminals covered to prevent short -circuits.  CT \nDEEP believes that EPA should consider a similar provision (such as requiring the removal of spray nozz les or re -capping each aerosol can) to prevent such releases.  \n \nPage 4 of 7 \n \n6.) Aerosol Can Puncturing and Incompatible Materials.  In Section IV.B.2 of the proposed \nrule preamble (end of page 11661 \u2013 beginning of page 11662), EPA requests comment on \u201cestablishing addition al regulatory requirements for can draining devices and limits on \naerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.\u201d  In response, CT DEEP believes that the final rule should contain an affirm ative requirement prohibiting the commingling of incompatible \nmaterials generated as a result of the puncturing and draining of aerosol cans.  CT DEEP does not believe that the proposed requirement for operators of aerosol can puncturing devices to establi sh a written procedure  that includes addressing incompatibles  is \nsufficiently protective to properly address the incompatibility problem.  CT DEEP believes that the prohibition on mixing of incompatibles could be easily added to proposed sections 273.13(e) (iii) and 273.33(e)(iii), alongside the language requiring \npuncturing to be done in a manner to prevent fires and releases.  \n \n7.) Aerosol Can Puncturing by Handlers Other than the Generator of the Aerosol Cans.  In \nSection IV.B.2 of the proposed rule preamble ( page  11662, column I, second paragraph), \nEPA requests comment o n \u201climiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that \nare not commercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensatio n).  In response, CT DEEP believes that the \nfinal rule should not allow commercial processors to puncture and drain aerosol cans that it has received from customers, and that such commercial processors should be required to comply with the requirements for  Universal Waste destination facilities in order to \nconduct this activity.  CT DEEP would go even further and suggest  that the final rule \nshould prohibit aerosol can puncturing and draining by anyone  other than the initial \ngenerator of the aerosol cans, in cluding handlers other than \u201ccommercial processors\u201d that \nare not the generator.  CT DEEP believes that there may be entities, such as retailers or wholesalers, which may be inclined to offer this ser vice, though perhaps not for a fee.  \nCT DEEP believes that puncturing and draining at such facilities would present the same potential problems as would be likely to occur at \u201ccommercial processors.\u201d  These problems include things such as accumulating large numbers of aerosol cans  without \nprocessing them, accumu lating  large volumes of drained liquids without properly \ndisposing of them, and the attendant fire hazards associated with such accumulation . \n \n8.) Effect on Household Hazardous Waste Collection Programs.  In Section IV.B.3., EPA \ndescribes what it believes the effect of the proposed rule would be on household waste and waste generated by very small quantity generators (formerly known as conditionally -\nexempt small quantity generators).  CT DEEP agrees with the assessment in this section, and would add the following:  \n \na. If Made Final, the Proposed Rule W ould Reduce Costs for Household Hazardous \nWaste Programs.   EPA notes in this section that, if the proposed rule were to \nbecome final, hazardous aerosol cans generated from households could be voluntarily managed under the Universal Waste Rule, as provided by 40 CFR 273.8.  CT DEEP notes that in many states household hazardous waste programs are required to manage the waste they collect as hazardous waste, are req uired to \ndispose of it at a permitted TSDF, or elect to do so voluntarily to ensure proper management.  Such is the case in Connecticut.  As a result, CT DEEP believes that the proposed rule would have the effect of reducing costs for household hazardous w aste programs that manage aerosol cans as hazardous waste, since \nPage 5 of 7 \n \nmanagement as Universal Waste is typically more efficient and more cost effective than fully -regulated hazardous wastes.  \n \n9.) Recommended Changes to Proposed Language at Section 273.13(e)(ii) and  273.33(e)(ii).  \nCT DEEP believes that the opening language of each of these respective sections should be modified to require not only the development of a written procedure for the management of aerosol cans that are punctured and drained, but also that such procedure must be followed.  The procedure is of no use if it is not followed.  Furthermore, absent language requiring that the written procedure be followed, EP A and  authorized states \nwould have no recourse for enforcement of the written procedure  in the event that it is not \nfollowed. \n \n10.) Commen ts Regarding Aerosol Cans and the Reactivity Characteristic.   CT DEEP notes \nthat EPA makes no mention in the proposed rule regarding reactivity characteristic  as it \npertains to aerosol cans .  More specifically, EPA does not indicate whether aerosol cans \nmay exhibit this characteristic, or if so, under which circumstances.  Because of the importance of this issue to the characterization of aerosol cans, and to their proper management, CT DEEP believes that EPA sho uld provide clear guidance on this issue, \neither in the final rule language or preamble, or in separate guidance.  DEEP also has the following specific comments regarding aerosol cans and the reactivity characteristic:  \n \na. There is Clearly an Argument to be M ade that Some Types of Aerosol Cans \nMight Meet the Characteristic of Reactivity.   One of the parts of the definition of \nreactivity concerns materials that are \u201c capable of detonation or explosive reaction \nif \u2026 subjected to a strong initiating source  or if h eated under confine ment.\u201d  [40 \nCFR 261.23(a)(6)]  When heated under confinement, or subjected to a strong initiating source (e.g., an open flame), certain types of aerosol cans ( particularly \nthose that contain ignitable liquids and/or ignitable propellant gases such as \npropane or isobuta ne) are capable of failing suddenly.  When the can suddenly \nfails, it can release its contents as a cloud of propellant and liquid particles, that, if a flame or other source of ignition is present, can ignite very rapidly, causing a  \nfireball and an explosive shock wave.  Such an explosive reaction could be interpreted as meeting the definition of reactivity as described in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).  As CT DEEP noted in its May 30, 2014 comments on the Retail NODA (see item number  5 of these comments ), DEEP is aware of an incident in \nConnecticut  in which the explosion of a single aerosol can of hairspray produced \na shock wave that resulted in significant damage to a hotel. \n \nTo be clear, CT DEEP does not believe that all aerosol cans should be consi dered \nreactive hazardous waste.  For example, CT DEEP believes that an aqueous -based \nspray window cleaner that uses carbon dioxide as a propellant would not produce \u201cdetonation \u2026 or explosive reaction\u201d even if it were overheated or subj ected to a \nstrong initiating force, such as an open flame.  Such an aerosol can may depressurize suddenly, but with nothing like the kind of force described in the previous paragraph.  \n EPA has stated in numerous guidanc e documents (see for example RCRA On -\nLine D ocuments 11780, 11782, 11806, and 14235) that it cannot make a \ndefinitive statement regarding the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to \nPage 6 of 7 \n \naerosol cans.  However, CT DEEP believe s that EPA should provide guidance in \nsome form as to the appli cability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans.  \n \nb. Reactivity May Be the Only Reason that Some Aerosol Cans Might Be \nHazardous.  Aerosol cans can  be hazardous in any of several ways.  They may \nexhibit the characteristic of ignitability (e.g., by c ontaining an ignitable liquid \nproduct, or a propellant that is an ignitable gas).  They may exhibit the characteristic of corrosivity (e.g., by containing a corrosive product, such as a caustic oven cleaner).  They may exhibit the characteristic of toxicit y by \ncontaining one or more TCLP constituents in excess of the limits specified in 40 CFR 21.24.  They may also be listed commercial chemical products (i.e., U - or P -\nlisted) by containing one of the se listed constituents as the sole active ingredient.  \nHowever, depending on how one defines \u201creactivity\u201d with respect to aerosol cans, it is conceivable that an aerosol can might be hazardous for the characteristic of reactivity but not ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or the U - or P -listed \ncommercial chemical product listings as described above.  For example, consider an aerosol product that contains a combustible (but not ignitable) liquid along with a non- ignitable propellant, such as carbon dioxide.  If such an aerosol can \nwere \u201cheated under confinement\u201d it could, as described in paragraph a. above, \nsuddenly fail with an attendant rapid deflagration or explosion.  In a case such as \nthis, whether or not the reactivity characteristic applies may be the only thing making it a hazardous, and under the proposed rule, a Universal Waste.   If the \nreactivity characteristic were not to apply to this waste, it would not be subject to regulation  even under the reduced Universal Waste requirements.  \n \nc. Universal Wastes Are Ultimately Subject to RCRA Treatment and Land Disp osal \nRestriction Requirements.   Even if aerosol cans are designated as a Universal \nWaste, they would become subject to full RCRA Treatment and LDR requirements once they are sent to a Universal Waste Destination Facility.  Although a Destination Facility may be exempt from RCRA treatment permitting requirements if it engages in recycling (as provided in 40 CFR 261.6(c)), it would remain subject to RCRA storage permitting requirements for any storage that occurs prior to treatment.  In addition, wastes from the treatment or recycling of aerosol cans must meet the applicable LDR standards prior to land disposal.  As a result, if an aerosol can is designated as reactive hazardous waste, it would be subject to the LDR treatment standards for reactive hazardous w aste. \n \nd. Reactive Hazardous Wastes May Be  More Difficult or  More Expensive to Treat \nor Dispose of than Other Types of Hazardous Waste.   CT DEEP has become \naware that aerosol cans may be more difficult and more expensive to treat or \ndispose if they have been  assigned the D003 (reactivity) waste code, as opposed \nto other waste codes (e.g., D001, ignitable hazardous waste).  CT DEEP suspects that this may be the case for either or both of the following reasons:  (1) many commercial TSDFs are prohibited from acc epting reactive hazardous wastes \nunder the ir TSDF permits, or are restricted with respect to the specific types of \nreactive hazardous waste they are allowed to accept; and, (2) D003 reactive hazardous wastes are more limited in terms of the available LDR t reatment  \ntechnologies as opposed to D001 ignitable hazardous wastes (more specifically, 40 CFR 268.40 indicates that t he latter can be treated using  the DEACT, \nPage 7 of 7 \n \nREORGS, or CMBST  treatment technologies, whereas the only allowed treatment \ntechnology for the former is DEACT).  This raises a practical consideration with respect to the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans \u2013 namely that designating them as rea ctive may limit recycling/disposal options and \nincrease the cost of proper management.  \n  This concludes CT  DEEP\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule.

However, CT DEEP \nhas a number of comments on the proposed rule, which are d etailed in the following numbered \nsections.  \n \n1.) Comment on EPA\u2019s Assumption that Eligible States Would Adopt the Aerosol Can Rule \nWhen Final.  In Section I.D. of the proposed rule preamble, EPA requests comment on its \nassumption that states would adopt the aerosol can rule if it were to become final. As noted above, CT DEEP generally supports the proposed rule, and barring any major adverse changes to the proposed rule, would be inclined to adopt such a rule if it were made final.  However, as with other optional EPA rule s, CT DEEP would evaluate \nadoption in light of available resources and competin g priorities and consideration for \nwhether  cer tain more stringent or broader -in-scope provisions  are necessary to protect \nhuman health and the environment in Connecticut. \n \n2.) Comment on definition of \u201caerosol can.\u201d   In Section II.A. of the proposed rule preamble, \nEPA provides a description of aerosol ca ns in general.  EPA also discusses its proposed \ndefinition of aerosol cans in Section IV.A. of the proposed rule preamble.  CT DEEP \nurges EPA to either amend the definition of \u201caerosol can\u201d or provide a clarification in the final rule preamble as to whethe r or not certain types of pressurized containers other than \ntypical aerosol containers would meet the definition of an \u201caerosol can,\u201d including but not limited to the following types of containers:  \n \na. Pharmaceutical products that are delivered in the form of  a spray or mist.  These \ncan include  spray sunscreen products, topical anesthetics such as benzocaine, \nethyl chloride, or \u201cFluori -Methane,\u201d and products packaged in inhalers.  Some of \nPage 2 of 7 \n \nthese products contain hazardous ingredients, others may contain hazardous propellants.  Although they may be much smaller than a typical aerosol can, these devices function in essentially the same manner, and CT DEEP believes that EPA should clarify  the status of these products under the proposed Universal Waste \nrule changes,  particularly in light of EPA\u2019s anticipated rulemaking with respect to \nhazardous pharmaceuticals.  Such a clarification would help to avoid confusion over which set of requirements such devices should (or may) be managed.  \n \nb. Pepper -spray containers , such as those  used for crowd control or self -defense by \nlaw enforcement agencies .  CT DEEP has received several inquiries about how \nthese devices should be managed.  This is particularly a concern for law enforcement agencies since these devices have a limited shelf life, and  such \nagencies find themselves having to dispose of large numbers of unused pepper spray containers that have exceeded their shelf lives.   Some of these devices \nutilize flammable propellants and would be regulated as hazardous waste when dispos ed.  CT DEEP believes that these devices should be considered to be \n\u201caerosol cans .\u201d  Like the containers  described above, the se device function in \nessentially the same manner as more typical aerosol cans.  \n \nc. Spray foam insulation kits, such as the kinds available at home improvement \nstores.   These units are often quite large in size (up to several gallons).  Because \nof their large size, and because of the potential problems they would cause with aerosol can puncturing devices (e.g. foaming up inside  the d rained liquids \ncollection container, or plugging up the puncturing device), CT DEEP believes that these foam insulation kits should not be considered to be \u201caerosol cans.\u201d  \n \n3.) Expected Changes in the Management of Aerosol Cans.  In Section III.B. of the proposed \nrule preamble, EPA describes the kinds of changes it expects the proposed rule would make with respect to the management of aerosol cans  (e.g., increased diversion from \nmunicipal solid waste landfills and incinerators ).  CT DEEP agrees with EPA\u2019s \nasses sment of these changes, and believes that the proposed rule would also have the \nfollowing environmentally -beneficial effects:  \n \na. Generators Would Be Likely to Co- Manage Both Hazardous and Non -Hazardous \nAerosol Cans if the Proposed Rule Were to Become Final.   Many generators of \naerosol cans use a wide variety of aerosol products, some of which may be hazardous and some of which may not be hazardous.  In addition, it is often difficult or time -consuming for such generators to segregate hazardous from  non-\nhazar dous at the point of disposal.  Furthermore, generators of a wide variety of \naerosol cans may find it difficult to ensure that on -site staff properly manage \nhazardous vs. non- hazardous waste aerosol cans.  As a result, DEEP believes that \nmany such generators would be inclined to manage all  of their waste aerosol cans \nas Universal Waste (i.e., both the hazardous and non- hazardous ones), since this \napproach would be the simplest one to implement at their site,  would ensure that \nall types of aerosol cans are p roperly disposed of, and at the same time would be \nstill be economically feasible under the Universal Waste rule.  \n  \nPage 3 of 7 \n \nb. Generators Would Also Be Likely to Co- Manage Both Empty an d Full Aerosol \nCans if the Proposed Rule Were to Become Final.   It can often be di fficult to \nconfirm if an aerosol can is \u201cempty\u201d and therefore exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste pursuant to 40 CFR 261.7.  For example, the nozzle may clog, leaving a certain amount of the liquid, solid , and/or gaseous  contents inside the \ncan.  As a result, CT DEEP believes that many generators of \u201cempty\u201d aerosol cans \nwill opt to manage them under the proposed Universal Waste requirements even though they would not be required to do so.  Doing this would also provide consistency for facility staff  that generate empty aerosol cans, and serve to \nprevent non- empty cans from ending up in the solid waste stream, while at the \nsame time being economically feasible under the Universal Waste rule.  \n \nCT DEEP notes that it is aware of some generators in Connec ticut that are already \nengaging in either or both of the practices described above, and believes  that such \npractices would only become more common  if the proposed rule were made final, owing \nto the reduced costs afforded by the ability to manage waste aerosol cans as Universal Waste as opposed to fully -regulated hazardous waste.  \n \n4.) EPA Should Adopt a Maximum Volume for Aerosol Cans.  In section IV.A. of the \npreamble, EPA notes that it did not set a limitation on the size of aerosol cans eligible for management as Universal Waste under the proposed rule.  EPA also notes that the State of Utah s et a limit of 24 ounces in that  state\u2019s Universal Waste desi gnation for aerosol \ncans.  EPA solicits comment on whether or not the federal rule should include a similar provision.  In response, CT DEEP believes that EPA should set such a  volume  limit, and \nthat Utah\u2019s 24 ounce limit would be an appropriate limit for a  number of reasons.  In \nparticular, the 24 -ounce number would capture the vast majority of devices ordinarily \nthought of as \u201caerosol cans,\u201d and would exclude some potentially problematic devices such as the spray foam insulation kits described in comment 2.c. above.  \n \n5.) EPA Should Consider Adding a Requirement to Prevent Discharge of Propellant Gases \nfrom  Aerosol Cans During Storage.  In Section IV.B.1. of the proposed rule preamble, \nEPA discusses the requirements it is proposing with respect to the management of aerosol cans, including requirements to prevent fires and releases.  While CT DEEP supports these requirements, it is concerned that they may not go far enough with respect to addressing a particular scenario that is likely to result in releases  of pr opellant gases, \nwhich can be highly ignitable or flammable.  In particular, generators of aerosol cans often store them loose ly inside larger containers such as 55 -gallon drums.  If the aerosol \ncan nozzles are not removed, or caps are not secured in place on the tops of the aerosol cans, there is the possibility that a nozzle could be depressed or deflected by other cans in the outer container, causing the discharge of the contents of the can.  This could occur randomly and unpredictably as the result of jostling of the loose cans during storage or transportation.  Such releases could cause the build- up of combustible gases and result in \na fire or explosion hazard.  This issue is similar to the issue of securing battery terminals when shipping loose batterie s in containers.  US DOT requires such batteries over 9 volts \nto be in a separate container or have the terminals covered to prevent short -circuits.  CT \nDEEP believes that EPA should consider a similar provision (such as requiring the removal of spray nozz les or re -capping each aerosol can) to prevent such releases.  \n \nPage 4 of 7 \n \n6.) Aerosol Can Puncturing and Incompatible Materials.  In Section IV.B.2 of the proposed \nrule preamble (end of page 11661 \u2013 beginning of page 11662), EPA requests comment on \u201cestablishing addition al regulatory requirements for can draining devices and limits on \naerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that may be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.\u201d  In response, CT DEEP believes that the final rule should contain an affirm ative requirement prohibiting the commingling of incompatible \nmaterials generated as a result of the puncturing and draining of aerosol cans.  CT DEEP does not believe that the proposed requirement for operators of aerosol can puncturing devices to establi sh a written procedure  that includes addressing incompatibles  is \nsufficiently protective to properly address the incompatibility problem.  CT DEEP believes that the prohibition on mixing of incompatibles could be easily added to proposed sections 273.13(e) (iii) and 273.33(e)(iii), alongside the language requiring \npuncturing to be done in a manner to prevent fires and releases.  \n \n7.) Aerosol Can Puncturing by Handlers Other than the Generator of the Aerosol Cans.  In \nSection IV.B.2 of the proposed rule preamble ( page  11662, column I, second paragraph), \nEPA requests comment o n \u201climiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that \nare not commercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensatio n).  In response, CT DEEP believes that the \nfinal rule should not allow commercial processors to puncture and drain aerosol cans that it has received from customers, and that such commercial processors should be required to comply with the requirements for  Universal Waste destination facilities in order to \nconduct this activity.  CT DEEP would go even further and suggest  that the final rule \nshould prohibit aerosol can puncturing and draining by anyone  other than the initial \ngenerator of the aerosol cans, in cluding handlers other than \u201ccommercial processors\u201d that \nare not the generator.  CT DEEP believes that there may be entities, such as retailers or wholesalers, which may be inclined to offer this ser vice, though perhaps not for a fee.  \nCT DEEP believes that puncturing and draining at such facilities would present the same potential problems as would be likely to occur at \u201ccommercial processors.\u201d  These problems include things such as accumulating large numbers of aerosol cans  without \nprocessing them, accumu lating  large volumes of drained liquids without properly \ndisposing of them, and the attendant fire hazards associated with such accumulation . \n \n8.) Effect on Household Hazardous Waste Collection Programs.  In Section IV.B.3., EPA \ndescribes what it believes the effect of the proposed rule would be on household waste and waste generated by very small quantity generators (formerly known as conditionally -\nexempt small quantity generators).  CT DEEP agrees with the assessment in this section, and would add the following:  \n \na. If Made Final, the Proposed Rule W ould Reduce Costs for Household Hazardous \nWaste Programs.   EPA notes in this section that, if the proposed rule were to \nbecome final, hazardous aerosol cans generated from households could be voluntarily managed under the Universal Waste Rule, as provided by 40 CFR 273.8.  CT DEEP notes that in many states household hazardous waste programs are required to manage the waste they collect as hazardous waste, are req uired to \ndispose of it at a permitted TSDF, or elect to do so voluntarily to ensure proper management.  Such is the case in Connecticut.  As a result, CT DEEP believes that the proposed rule would have the effect of reducing costs for household hazardous w aste programs that manage aerosol cans as hazardous waste, since \nPage 5 of 7 \n \nmanagement as Universal Waste is typically more efficient and more cost effective than fully -regulated hazardous wastes.  \n \n9.) Recommended Changes to Proposed Language at Section 273.13(e)(ii) and  273.33(e)(ii).  \nCT DEEP believes that the opening language of each of these respective sections should be modified to require not only the development of a written procedure for the management of aerosol cans that are punctured and drained, but also that such procedure must be followed.  The procedure is of no use if it is not followed.  Furthermore, absent language requiring that the written procedure be followed, EP A and  authorized states \nwould have no recourse for enforcement of the written procedure  in the event that it is not \nfollowed. \n \n10.) Commen ts Regarding Aerosol Cans and the Reactivity Characteristic.   CT DEEP notes \nthat EPA makes no mention in the proposed rule regarding reactivity characteristic  as it \npertains to aerosol cans .  More specifically, EPA does not indicate whether aerosol cans \nmay exhibit this characteristic, or if so, under which circumstances.  Because of the importance of this issue to the characterization of aerosol cans, and to their proper management, CT DEEP believes that EPA sho uld provide clear guidance on this issue, \neither in the final rule language or preamble, or in separate guidance.  DEEP also has the following specific comments regarding aerosol cans and the reactivity characteristic:  \n \na. There is Clearly an Argument to be M ade that Some Types of Aerosol Cans \nMight Meet the Characteristic of Reactivity.   One of the parts of the definition of \nreactivity concerns materials that are \u201c capable of detonation or explosive reaction \nif \u2026 subjected to a strong initiating source  or if h eated under confine ment.\u201d  [40 \nCFR 261.23(a)(6)]  When heated under confinement, or subjected to a strong initiating source (e.g., an open flame), certain types of aerosol cans ( particularly \nthose that contain ignitable liquids and/or ignitable propellant gases such as \npropane or isobuta ne) are capable of failing suddenly.  When the can suddenly \nfails, it can release its contents as a cloud of propellant and liquid particles, that, if a flame or other source of ignition is present, can ignite very rapidly, causing a  \nfireball and an explosive shock wave.  Such an explosive reaction could be interpreted as meeting the definition of reactivity as described in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).  As CT DEEP noted in its May 30, 2014 comments on the Retail NODA (see item number  5 of these comments ), DEEP is aware of an incident in \nConnecticut  in which the explosion of a single aerosol can of hairspray produced \na shock wave that resulted in significant damage to a hotel. \n \nTo be clear, CT DEEP does not believe that all aerosol cans should be consi dered \nreactive hazardous waste.  For example, CT DEEP believes that an aqueous -based \nspray window cleaner that uses carbon dioxide as a propellant would not produce \u201cdetonation \u2026 or explosive reaction\u201d even if it were overheated or subj ected to a \nstrong initiating force, such as an open flame.  Such an aerosol can may depressurize suddenly, but with nothing like the kind of force described in the previous paragraph.  \n EPA has stated in numerous guidanc e documents (see for example RCRA On -\nLine D ocuments 11780, 11782, 11806, and 14235) that it cannot make a \ndefinitive statement regarding the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to \nPage 6 of 7 \n \naerosol cans.  However, CT DEEP believe s that EPA should provide guidance in \nsome form as to the appli cability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans.  \n \nb. Reactivity May Be the Only Reason that Some Aerosol Cans Might Be \nHazardous.  Aerosol cans can  be hazardous in any of several ways.  They may \nexhibit the characteristic of ignitability (e.g., by c ontaining an ignitable liquid \nproduct, or a propellant that is an ignitable gas).  They may exhibit the characteristic of corrosivity (e.g., by containing a corrosive product, such as a caustic oven cleaner).  They may exhibit the characteristic of toxicit y by \ncontaining one or more TCLP constituents in excess of the limits specified in 40 CFR 21.24.  They may also be listed commercial chemical products (i.e., U - or P -\nlisted) by containing one of the se listed constituents as the sole active ingredient.  \nHowever, depending on how one defines \u201creactivity\u201d with respect to aerosol cans, it is conceivable that an aerosol can might be hazardous for the characteristic of reactivity but not ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or the U - or P -listed \ncommercial chemical product listings as described above.  For example, consider an aerosol product that contains a combustible (but not ignitable) liquid along with a non- ignitable propellant, such as carbon dioxide.  If such an aerosol can \nwere \u201cheated under confinement\u201d it could, as described in paragraph a. above, \nsuddenly fail with an attendant rapid deflagration or explosion.  In a case such as \nthis, whether or not the reactivity characteristic applies may be the only thing making it a hazardous, and under the proposed rule, a Universal Waste.   If the \nreactivity characteristic were not to apply to this waste, it would not be subject to regulation  even under the reduced Universal Waste requirements.  \n \nc. Universal Wastes Are Ultimately Subject to RCRA Treatment and Land Disp osal \nRestriction Requirements.   Even if aerosol cans are designated as a Universal \nWaste, they would become subject to full RCRA Treatment and LDR requirements once they are sent to a Universal Waste Destination Facility.  Although a Destination Facility may be exempt from RCRA treatment permitting requirements if it engages in recycling (as provided in 40 CFR 261.6(c)), it would remain subject to RCRA storage permitting requirements for any storage that occurs prior to treatment.  In addition, wastes from the treatment or recycling of aerosol cans must meet the applicable LDR standards prior to land disposal.  As a result, if an aerosol can is designated as reactive hazardous waste, it would be subject to the LDR treatment standards for reactive hazardous w aste. \n \nd. Reactive Hazardous Wastes May Be  More Difficult or  More Expensive to Treat \nor Dispose of than Other Types of Hazardous Waste.   CT DEEP has become \naware that aerosol cans may be more difficult and more expensive to treat or \ndispose if they have been  assigned the D003 (reactivity) waste code, as opposed \nto other waste codes (e.g., D001, ignitable hazardous waste).  CT DEEP suspects that this may be the case for either or both of the following reasons:  (1) many commercial TSDFs are prohibited from acc epting reactive hazardous wastes \nunder the ir TSDF permits, or are restricted with respect to the specific types of \nreactive hazardous waste they are allowed to accept; and, (2) D003 reactive hazardous wastes are more limited in terms of the available LDR t reatment  \ntechnologies as opposed to D001 ignitable hazardous wastes (more specifically, 40 CFR 268.40 indicates that t he latter can be treated using  the DEACT, \nPage 7 of 7 \n \nREORGS, or CMBST  treatment technologies, whereas the only allowed treatment \ntechnology for the former is DEACT).  This raises a practical consideration with respect to the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans \u2013 namely that designating them as rea ctive may limit recycling/disposal options and \nincrease the cost of proper management.  \n  This concludes CT  DEEP\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule. Please contact Ross Bunnell of my \nstaff if you should have any questions on the foregoing. Mr. Bunnell may be r eached by phone at  \n(860) 424- 3274, or by email at ross.bunnell@ct.gov\n.  \n Sincerely,  \n \n \nRobert C.

In \nSection IV.B.2 of the proposed rule preamble ( page  11662, column I, second paragraph), \nEPA requests comment o n \u201climiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that \nare not commercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensatio n).  In response, CT DEEP believes that the \nfinal rule should not allow commercial processors to puncture and drain aerosol cans that it has received from customers, and that such commercial processors should be required to comply with the requirements for  Universal Waste destination facilities in order to \nconduct this activity.  CT DEEP would go even further and suggest  that the final rule \nshould prohibit aerosol can puncturing and draining by anyone  other than the initial \ngenerator of the aerosol cans, in cluding handlers other than \u201ccommercial processors\u201d that \nare not the generator.  CT DEEP believes that there may be entities, such as retailers or wholesalers, which may be inclined to offer this ser vice, though perhaps not for a fee.  \nCT DEEP believes that puncturing and draining at such facilities would present the same potential problems as would be likely to occur at \u201ccommercial processors.\u201d  These problems include things such as accumulating large numbers of aerosol cans  without \nprocessing them, accumu lating  large volumes of drained liquids without properly \ndisposing of them, and the attendant fire hazards associated with such accumulation . \n \n8.) Effect on Household Hazardous Waste Collection Programs.  In Section IV.B.3., EPA \ndescribes what it believes the effect of the proposed rule would be on household waste and waste generated by very small quantity generators (formerly known as conditionally -\nexempt small quantity generators).  CT DEEP agrees with the assessment in this section, and would add the following:  \n \na. If Made Final, the Proposed Rule W ould Reduce Costs for Household Hazardous \nWaste Programs.   EPA notes in this section that, if the proposed rule were to \nbecome final, hazardous aerosol cans generated from households could be voluntarily managed under the Universal Waste Rule, as provided by 40 CFR 273.8.  CT DEEP notes that in many states household hazardous waste programs are required to manage the waste they collect as hazardous waste, are req uired to \ndispose of it at a permitted TSDF, or elect to do so voluntarily to ensure proper management.  Such is the case in Connecticut.  As a result, CT DEEP believes that the proposed rule would have the effect of reducing costs for household hazardous w aste programs that manage aerosol cans as hazardous waste, since \nPage 5 of 7 \n \nmanagement as Universal Waste is typically more efficient and more cost effective than fully -regulated hazardous wastes.  \n \n9.) Recommended Changes to Proposed Language at Section 273.13(e)(ii) and  273.33(e)(ii).  \nCT DEEP believes that the opening language of each of these respective sections should be modified to require not only the development of a written procedure for the management of aerosol cans that are punctured and drained, but also that such procedure must be followed.  The procedure is of no use if it is not followed.  Furthermore, absent language requiring that the written procedure be followed, EP A and  authorized states \nwould have no recourse for enforcement of the written procedure  in the event that it is not \nfollowed. \n \n10.) Commen ts Regarding Aerosol Cans and the Reactivity Characteristic.   CT DEEP notes \nthat EPA makes no mention in the proposed rule regarding reactivity characteristic  as it \npertains to aerosol cans .  More specifically, EPA does not indicate whether aerosol cans \nmay exhibit this characteristic, or if so, under which circumstances.  Because of the importance of this issue to the characterization of aerosol cans, and to their proper management, CT DEEP believes that EPA sho uld provide clear guidance on this issue, \neither in the final rule language or preamble, or in separate guidance.  DEEP also has the following specific comments regarding aerosol cans and the reactivity characteristic:  \n \na. There is Clearly an Argument to be M ade that Some Types of Aerosol Cans \nMight Meet the Characteristic of Reactivity.   One of the parts of the definition of \nreactivity concerns materials that are \u201c capable of detonation or explosive reaction \nif \u2026 subjected to a strong initiating source  or if h eated under confine ment.\u201d  [40 \nCFR 261.23(a)(6)]  When heated under confinement, or subjected to a strong initiating source (e.g., an open flame), certain types of aerosol cans ( particularly \nthose that contain ignitable liquids and/or ignitable propellant gases such as \npropane or isobuta ne) are capable of failing suddenly.  When the can suddenly \nfails, it can release its contents as a cloud of propellant and liquid particles, that, if a flame or other source of ignition is present, can ignite very rapidly, causing a  \nfireball and an explosive shock wave.  Such an explosive reaction could be interpreted as meeting the definition of reactivity as described in 40 CFR 261.23(a)(6).  As CT DEEP noted in its May 30, 2014 comments on the Retail NODA (see item number  5 of these comments ), DEEP is aware of an incident in \nConnecticut  in which the explosion of a single aerosol can of hairspray produced \na shock wave that resulted in significant damage to a hotel. \n \nTo be clear, CT DEEP does not believe that all aerosol cans should be consi dered \nreactive hazardous waste.  For example, CT DEEP believes that an aqueous -based \nspray window cleaner that uses carbon dioxide as a propellant would not produce \u201cdetonation \u2026 or explosive reaction\u201d even if it were overheated or subj ected to a \nstrong initiating force, such as an open flame.  Such an aerosol can may depressurize suddenly, but with nothing like the kind of force described in the previous paragraph.  \n EPA has stated in numerous guidanc e documents (see for example RCRA On -\nLine D ocuments 11780, 11782, 11806, and 14235) that it cannot make a \ndefinitive statement regarding the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to \nPage 6 of 7 \n \naerosol cans.  However, CT DEEP believe s that EPA should provide guidance in \nsome form as to the appli cability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans.  \n \nb. Reactivity May Be the Only Reason that Some Aerosol Cans Might Be \nHazardous.  Aerosol cans can  be hazardous in any of several ways.  They may \nexhibit the characteristic of ignitability (e.g., by c ontaining an ignitable liquid \nproduct, or a propellant that is an ignitable gas).  They may exhibit the characteristic of corrosivity (e.g., by containing a corrosive product, such as a caustic oven cleaner).  They may exhibit the characteristic of toxicit y by \ncontaining one or more TCLP constituents in excess of the limits specified in 40 CFR 21.24.  They may also be listed commercial chemical products (i.e., U - or P -\nlisted) by containing one of the se listed constituents as the sole active ingredient.  \nHowever, depending on how one defines \u201creactivity\u201d with respect to aerosol cans, it is conceivable that an aerosol can might be hazardous for the characteristic of reactivity but not ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or the U - or P -listed \ncommercial chemical product listings as described above.  For example, consider an aerosol product that contains a combustible (but not ignitable) liquid along with a non- ignitable propellant, such as carbon dioxide.  If such an aerosol can \nwere \u201cheated under confinement\u201d it could, as described in paragraph a. above, \nsuddenly fail with an attendant rapid deflagration or explosion.  In a case such as \nthis, whether or not the reactivity characteristic applies may be the only thing making it a hazardous, and under the proposed rule, a Universal Waste.   If the \nreactivity characteristic were not to apply to this waste, it would not be subject to regulation  even under the reduced Universal Waste requirements.  \n \nc. Universal Wastes Are Ultimately Subject to RCRA Treatment and Land Disp osal \nRestriction Requirements.   Even if aerosol cans are designated as a Universal \nWaste, they would become subject to full RCRA Treatment and LDR requirements once they are sent to a Universal Waste Destination Facility.  Although a Destination Facility may be exempt from RCRA treatment permitting requirements if it engages in recycling (as provided in 40 CFR 261.6(c)), it would remain subject to RCRA storage permitting requirements for any storage that occurs prior to treatment.  In addition, wastes from the treatment or recycling of aerosol cans must meet the applicable LDR standards prior to land disposal.  As a result, if an aerosol can is designated as reactive hazardous waste, it would be subject to the LDR treatment standards for reactive hazardous w aste. \n \nd. Reactive Hazardous Wastes May Be  More Difficult or  More Expensive to Treat \nor Dispose of than Other Types of Hazardous Waste.   CT DEEP has become \naware that aerosol cans may be more difficult and more expensive to treat or \ndispose if they have been  assigned the D003 (reactivity) waste code, as opposed \nto other waste codes (e.g., D001, ignitable hazardous waste).  CT DEEP suspects that this may be the case for either or both of the following reasons:  (1) many commercial TSDFs are prohibited from acc epting reactive hazardous wastes \nunder the ir TSDF permits, or are restricted with respect to the specific types of \nreactive hazardous waste they are allowed to accept; and, (2) D003 reactive hazardous wastes are more limited in terms of the available LDR t reatment  \ntechnologies as opposed to D001 ignitable hazardous wastes (more specifically, 40 CFR 268.40 indicates that t he latter can be treated using  the DEACT, \nPage 7 of 7 \n \nREORGS, or CMBST  treatment technologies, whereas the only allowed treatment \ntechnology for the former is DEACT).  This raises a practical consideration with respect to the applicability of the reactivity characteristic to aerosol cans \u2013 namely that designating them as rea ctive may limit recycling/disposal options and \nincrease the cost of proper management.  \n  This concludes CT  DEEP\u2019s comments on the Proposed Rule. Please contact Ross Bunnell of my \nstaff if you should have any questions on the foregoing. Mr. Bunnell may be r eached by phone at  \n(860) 424- 3274, or by email at ross.bunnell@ct.gov\n.  \n Sincerely,  \n \n \nRobert C.

INTRODUCTION \nOn March 16, 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d)  published \nin the Federal Register , at 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654, a proposed rule to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to \nthe universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) \nregulations (the \u201cProposed Rule\u201d).   Under the Proposed Rule, aerosol cans, like other hazardous wastes \ndesignated as universal, would be managed in a streamlined manner that encourages environmentally \nsound collection and proper management of the waste within the system.1  The proposed expansion of the \nlist of universal wastes to include aerosol cans comports with EPA\u2019s multi-factor analysis for adding new \ntypes of universal wastes.  It also is consistent with EPA\u2019s efforts to ease regulatory burdens.   \nThe Cross-Cutting Issues Group (\u201cCCIG\u201d or \u201cGroup\u201d)2 respectfully submits these comments to \nsupport the Agency\u2019s proposal to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the RCRA universal waste \nprogram.  CCIG is a group of electric-generating companies with a diverse portfolio of generating assets \nlocated throughout the country.  CCIG members are impacted by a wide range of regulatory requirements \nestablished by EPA, including regulations and policies related to waste management under RCRA.  As \nexplained in detail below, CCIG fully supports the Proposed Rule and recommends that EPA adopt the \nrule regarding hazardous waste aerosol cans as proposed. \nII. COMMENTS \nA. Regulating Aerosol Cans as Universal Waste is Appropriate \nEPA\u2019s RCRA regulations streamline hazardous waste management standards for categories of \nhazardous waste considered \u201cuniversal wastes\u201d that are commonly generated and that pose a lower risk to \npeople and the environment than other hazardous wastes.3  Currently, EPA classifies four types of waste \nas universal waste: (1) batteries, (2) pesticides, (3) mercury-containing equipment, and (4) mercury \nlamps.4  Adding aerosol cans to this list is appropriate and consistent with RCRA regulations. \nIn determining whether to add new wastes to the RCRA universal waste program, EPA considers \nwhether the following non-exhaustive factors are present: \na) The waste is hazardous \n                                                      \n1 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654, 11,657 (Mar. 16, 2018). \n2 The CCIG members who support these comments are Alliant Energy Corporation, Entergy Services, Inc., Florida \nPower and Light, Louisville Gas & Electric/Kentucky Utilities, NextEra Energy, Inc., OGE Energy Corp., Public \nService Company of New Mexico, Talen Energy, Salt River Project, and Vectren Corp.. \n3 See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273. \n4 See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2-273.5. \nActive 37810633.3  2 b)  The waste is commonly generated (not specific to an industry) \nc) The waste is generated by a large number of generators (over 1,000 nationally) \nd) Systems used for collecting the waste (e.g., packaging, marking, labeling) would ensure \nclose stewardship \ne) The risk posed during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other \nhazardous wastes, and the proposed management standards would protect human health \nand the environment during accumulation and transport \nf) Regulation as universal waste will increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted \nfrom non-hazardous waste management systems \ng) Regulation as universal waste will improve implementation of and compliance with \nhazardous waste regulations.5 \nAs described by EPA in the Proposed Rule, aerosol cans satisfy all these factors.  Aerosol cans \nare similar to the other waste products that EPA already regulates as universal waste.  Like those \nproducts, aerosol cans are frequently hazardous (due to the ignitability of the propellant or the contents of \nthe can) but commonly and widely used, which makes disposal as hazardous waste difficult to control.6  \nNon-residential sources of all sizes, including businesses, industry, government agencies, and schools, use \naerosol cans for a multitude of purposes, ranging from painting to cleaning.7  EPA anticipates that the \nProposed Rule will impact over 18,000 facilities in at least eighteen different industrial sectors.8 Aerosol \ncans also pose a lower risk to people and the environment than other hazardous wastes.9   \nAs an additional factor10 weighing in favor of regulating aerosol cans as universal waste at the \nfederal level, California and Colorado added aerosol cans to their universal waste regulations precisely \nbecause of their lower risk,11 and New Mexico and Utah have also successfully implemented this \nprogram.  According to EPA, \u201c[f]eedback from state programs thus far indicates that management of \nitems such as aerosol cans . . .  as universal wastes works well.\u201d12  The Proposed Rule\u2019s definition of an \n\u201caerosol can\u201d that qualifies as universal waste is the same as the definition used by the California, \nColorado, and New Mexico universal waste programs.13  It is also generally consistent with the definition \nused in Utah.14  Specifically, \u201caerosol can\u201d for purposes of the Proposed Rule is \u201can intact container in \n                                                      \n5 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(a)-(g).  \n6 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(a). \n7 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(b). \n8 83 Fed.

Reg. at 11,660. \n14 Utah includes a size restriction on aerosol cans that may be managed as universal waste.  CCIG respectfully \nrequests that EPA adopt the Proposed Rule without a size restriction on the definition of aerosol can, as the broader \n \nActive 37810633.3  3 which gas under pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a \nspray or foam.\u201d15  In using this definition, EPA builds on proven regulatory systems to promote close \nstewardship of aerosol cans, increase the likelihood that aerosol cans will be diverted from non-hazardous \nwaste management systems, and improve compliance with hazardous waste regulations.  EPA notes that \n\u201cstate officials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol can \nuniversal waste programs have been in effect since 2002, and they have not identified any problems with \ncompliance with the standards.\u201d16 CCIG encourages EPA to adopt the Proposed Rule\u2019s definition of \n\u201caerosol can,\u201d which has proven successful in states\u2019 universal waste programs for over fifteen years. \nThe Proposed Rule contains reasonable management principles to ensure that universal waste \naerosol cans would be managed in a manner to prevent release of the universal waste, including that the \ncans be accumulated in a structurally sound container.17  CCIG believes that EPA\u2019s proposed \nmanagement standards for puncturing and draining aerosol cans by universal waste handlers are \nsufficiently protective of human health and the environment, without additional limitations on puncturing \nand draining of aerosol cans. \nB. Regulating Aerosol Cans as Universal Waste is Consistent with EPA\u2019s Efforts to \nEase Regulatory Burdens \nUniversal waste listings are streamlined regulations that typically ease the regulatory burden on \ngenerators and transporters of these wastes.18  EPA accurately recognizes that adding aerosol cans to the \nlist of universal wastes will result in significant cost savings for the regulated community.  EPA states \nthat the Proposed Rule \u201cis expected to result in an annual cost savings of $3.0 million to $63.3 million\u201d19 \nand time savings to facilities that handle aerosol can waste of 39,113 hours per year.20 \nThis is consistent with CCIG members\u2019 experience of managing aerosol cans.  One CCIG \nmember generates between 65,000 and 70,000 aerosol cans per year at its service centers, generating \nstations, and ancillary facilities.  It currently costs $1.40 to manage and dispose of the cans as hazardous \nwaste.  The company estimates that managing aerosol cans as universal waste will reduce the per-can cost \nto $1.14, if not lower. Classifying aerosol cans as universal waste would therefore save this company at \nleast $16,900 per year.  Further, because hazardous waste aerosol cans are the primary driver of the \nclassification of these facilities as Small Quantity Generators, the Proposed Rule would result in the \nreclassification of these facilities as Very Small Quantity Generators, creating additional cost savings by \n                                                                                                                                                                           \ndefinition, which has been proven successful in California, Colorado, and New Mexico, will provide the benefits of \nthe Proposed Rule to a greater number of aerosol cans. \n15 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,659-60. \n16 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,659. \n17 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,660. \n18 See, e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 25,492, 25,501-02 (May 11, 1995). \n19 83 Fed. Reg. at 11,655. EPA\u2019s primary analysis estimates that the Proposed Rule will result in annual cost savings \nof $3.0-$3.5 million by \u201ccalculating average monthly hazardous waste generation at each facility and comparing the \nquantities to RCRA monthly generation limits.\u201d  Regulatory Impact Analysis of Proposed Rule to Add Aerosol Cans \nto the Universal Waste Program, EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 at 47 (Feb. 2018).  Using a different methodology, \nEPA\u2019s alternative analysis estimates that cost savings from the Proposed Rule could range from $56.7 to $63.3 \nmillion annually.  Id.   \n20 83 Fed.

Cost saving associated with reclassification would benefit entities across \na wide variety of industrial sectors that use aerosol cans.  For instance, aerosol cans comprise a large \npercentage of the retail sector\u2019s hazardous waste stream.21  The savings associated with RCRA \nreclassification is a primary benefit of the Proposed Rule and one that will provide regulatory relief to \nsignificant numbers of Large and Small Quantity Generators.  \nIII. CONCLUSION \nCCIG appreciates the opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s proposed rule to list aerosol cans as \nuniversal waste.  The Group urges EPA to adopt the Proposed Rule, which would promote the appropriate \nmanagement of aerosol cans and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens while furthering the \noverarching goals hazardous waste regulation under RCRA.    \n \n \nDated: May 15, 2018       Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n                                                                                                \n \nMegan Berge  \nSamia Broadaway \nBaker Botts L.L.P. \n1299 Pennsylvania Ave., NW \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 639-7700  \n \n                                                      \n21 See Strategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA\u2019s Regulatory Framework  at 3. \n"

According to EPA, \u201c[f]eedback from state programs thus far indicates that management of \nitems such as aerosol cans . . .  as universal wastes works well.\u201d12  The Proposed Rule\u2019s definition of an \n\u201caerosol can\u201d that qualifies as universal waste is the same as the definition used by the California, \nColorado, and New Mexico universal waste programs.13  It is also generally consistent with the definition \nused in Utah.14  Specifically, \u201caerosol can\u201d for purposes of the Proposed Rule is \u201can intact container in \n                                                      \n5 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(a)-(g).  \n6 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(a). \n7 See id. at \u00a7 273.81(b). \n8 83 Fed.

EPA notes that \n\u201cstate officials from both California and Colorado stated to EPA that their respective aerosol can \nuniversal waste programs have been in effect since 2002, and they have not identified any problems with \ncompliance with the standards.\u201d16 CCIG encourages EPA to adopt the Proposed Rule\u2019s definition of \n\u201caerosol can,\u201d which has proven successful in states\u2019 universal waste programs for over fifteen years. \nThe Proposed Rule contains reasonable management principles to ensure that universal waste \naerosol cans would be managed in a manner to prevent release of the universal waste, including that the \ncans be accumulated in a structurally sound container.17  CCIG believes that EPA\u2019s proposed \nmanagement standards for puncturing and draining aerosol cans by universal waste handlers are \nsufficiently protective of human health and the environment, without additional limitations on puncturing \nand draining of aerosol cans. \nB. Regulating Aerosol Cans as Universal Waste is Consistent with EPA\u2019s Efforts to \nEase Regulatory Burdens \nUniversal waste listings are streamlined regulations that typically ease the regulatory burden on \ngenerators and transporters of these wastes.18  EPA accurately recognizes that adding aerosol cans to the \nlist of universal wastes will result in significant cost savings for the regulated community.  EPA states \nthat the Proposed Rule \u201cis expected to result in an annual cost savings of $3.0 million to $63.3 million\u201d19 \nand time savings to facilities that handle aerosol can waste of 39,113 hours per year.20 \nThis is consistent with CCIG members\u2019 experience of managing aerosol cans.  One CCIG \nmember generates between 65,000 and 70,000 aerosol cans per year at its service centers, generating \nstations, and ancillary facilities.  It currently costs $1.40 to manage and dispose of the cans as hazardous \nwaste.  The company estimates that managing aerosol cans as universal waste will reduce the per-can cost \nto $1.14, if not lower. Classifying aerosol cans as universal waste would therefore save this company at \nleast $16,900 per year.  Further, because hazardous waste aerosol cans are the primary driver of the \nclassification of these facilities as Small Quantity Generators, the Proposed Rule would result in the \nreclassification of these facilities as Very Small Quantity Generators, creating additional cost savings by \n                                                                                                                                                                           \ndefinition, which has been proven successful in California, Colorado, and New Mexico, will provide the benefits of \nthe Proposed Rule to a greater number of aerosol cans. \n15 83 Fed.

INTRODUCTION \nOn March 16, 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cAgency\u201d)  published \nin the Federal Register , at 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654, a proposed rule to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to \nthe universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) \nregulations (the \u201cProposed Rule\u201d).   Under the Proposed Rule, aerosol cans, like other hazardous wastes \ndesignated as universal, would be managed in a streamlined manner that encourages environmentally \nsound collection and proper management of the waste within the system.1  The proposed expansion of the \nlist of universal wastes to include aerosol cans comports with EPA\u2019s multi-factor analysis for adding new \ntypes of universal wastes.  It also is consistent with EPA\u2019s efforts to ease regulatory burdens.   \nThe Cross-Cutting Issues Group (\u201cCCIG\u201d or \u201cGroup\u201d)2 respectfully submits these comments to \nsupport the Agency\u2019s proposal to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the RCRA universal waste \nprogram.  CCIG is a group of electric-generating companies with a diverse portfolio of generating assets \nlocated throughout the country.  CCIG members are impacted by a wide range of regulatory requirements \nestablished by EPA, including regulations and policies related to waste management under RCRA.  As \nexplained in detail below, CCIG fully supports the Proposed Rule and recommends that EPA adopt the \nrule regarding hazardous waste aerosol cans as proposed. \nII. COMMENTS \nA. Regulating Aerosol Cans as Universal Waste is Appropriate \nEPA\u2019s RCRA regulations streamline hazardous waste management standards for categories of \nhazardous waste considered \u201cuniversal wastes\u201d that are commonly generated and that pose a lower risk to \npeople and the environment than other hazardous wastes.3  Currently, EPA classifies four types of waste \nas universal waste: (1) batteries, (2) pesticides, (3) mercury-containing equipment, and (4) mercury \nlamps.4  Adding aerosol cans to this list is appropriate and consistent with RCRA regulations. \nIn determining whether to add new wastes to the RCRA universal waste program, EPA considers \nwhether the following non-exhaustive factors are present: \na) The waste is hazardous \n                                                      \n1 83 Fed. Reg. 11,654, 11,657 (Mar. 16, 2018). \n2 The CCIG members who support these comments are Alliant Energy Corporation, Entergy Services, Inc., Florida \nPower and Light, Louisville Gas & Electric/Kentucky Utilities, NextEra Energy, Inc., OGE Energy Corp., Public \nService Company of New Mexico, Talen Energy, Salt River Project, and Vectren Corp.. \n3 See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273. \n4 See 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2-273.5. \nActive 37810633.3  2 b)  The waste is commonly generated (not specific to an industry) \nc) The waste is generated by a large number of generators (over 1,000 nationally) \nd) Systems used for collecting the waste (e.g., packaging, marking, labeling) would ensure \nclose stewardship \ne) The risk posed during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other \nhazardous wastes, and the proposed management standards would protect human health \nand the environment during accumulation and transport \nf) Regulation as universal waste will increase the likelihood that the waste will be diverted \nfrom non-hazardous waste management systems \ng) Regulation as universal waste will improve implementation of and compliance with \nhazardous waste regulations.5 \nAs described by EPA in the Proposed Rule, aerosol cans satisfy all these factors.  Aerosol cans \nare similar to the other waste products that EPA already regulates as universal waste.  Like those \nproducts, aerosol cans are frequently hazardous (due to the ignitability of the propellant or the contents of \nthe can) but commonly and widely used, which makes disposal as hazardous waste difficult to control.6  \nNon-residential sources of all sizes, including businesses, industry, government agencies, and schools, use \naerosol cans for a multitude of purposes, ranging from painting to cleaning.7  EPA anticipates that the \nProposed Rule will impact over 18,000 facilities in at least eighteen different industrial sectors.8 Aerosol \ncans also pose a lower risk to people and the environment than other hazardous wastes.9   \nAs an additional factor10 weighing in favor of regulating aerosol cans as universal waste at the \nfederal level, California and Colorado added aerosol cans to their universal waste regulations precisely \nbecause of their lower risk,11 and New Mexico and Utah have also successfully implemented this \nprogram.

We welcome t he opportunity to participate and comment on \nthis proposal. We would apprec iate the EPA\u2019s consideration of  the following comments:   \n \n \n1) It is remiss for the EPA to denounce this m anufacturer\u2019s technology  in its proposal, \nespecially since the ETV program has been disbanded and can no longer re-evaluate the manufacturers product. (Ref: page 11661, middle column, second paragraph \n \na. The ETV report referenced was conducted 19 years ago and was quoted out of \ncontext. The report recommended the product as safe to use as long as engineering and administrative controls etc.\u2026 were in-place. \nb. The manufacturer paid for this program and considered it research and a \nlearning experience. The manufacture\u2019s product instructions reflect the lessons \nlearned in this report, including segregation of incompatible chemicals, chemicals not to be recycled, with  instructions for engineering and \nadministrative controls  \nc. The product has a steady track record of  over two decades of safe use in the \nindustry. \n \n \n2) The EPA\u2019s proposal states: \u201cit remains the resp onsibility of the operator to ensure that \nthe puncturing device is properly draining the contents of the aerosol cans into the drum, that breakthrough is not occurring\u2026\u201d  We would like to request some clarification \non what constitutes breakthrough? In our conversations with you on Monday, May 14, \nyou indicated that the intent of this proposal was not to make things more stringent than they currently are, so if it is the intent of the EPA to lower the emissions standard, how would the industry pr actically achieve it?  \n \na. The ETV program no longer exists to verify manufactures claims, or to validate \neven a commercially engineered containment solution. \nb. In our instructions, a charcoal filter needs to be replaced often to maximize \ncollection of VOCs.

EPA, \u201c Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal \nWaste Regulations ,\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11654 (Mar. 16, 2018).  \n \nNucor is engaged in steel manufacturing and steel product manufacturing and fabrication \nthroughout the Country. To support these processes, Nucor uses various aerosol c an products. \nAfter use, these products become waste and would be subject to EPA\u2019s proposal.  In general, \nNucor is supportive of EPA\u2019s proposed rule. Managing aerosol cans as universal waste will ease \nthe regulatory burden of handling this waste stream whil e ensuring requisite environmental \nprotection. Moreover, codifying EPA\u2019s longstanding policy to allow aerosol can puncturing \nprovides needed certainty to the regulated community. Nucor has the following comments \nrequesting clarification on the applicabilit y and scope of the rule.  \n \n1. EPA should clarify that waste aerosol cans may be accumulated as universal waste \nprior to puncturing.  \nNucor understands the rule to offer two aerosol can management solutions. First, a \ngenerator may manage intact aerosol cans as  universal waste. Second, a generator may puncture \nand recycle the aerosol cans , collect the residuals, subject them to a hazardous waste \ndetermination and manage them accordingly.  \n \nNeither the preamble nor the proposed regulatory language directly addres ses the \nacceptability of combining these approaches. Under a common scenario, a generator would \ninitially collect intact, expended aerosol cans in a universal waste container. Then, once a \nsufficient amount has collected, a RCRA -trained operator would remo ve the cans from universal \nwaste management and subject them to the authorized puncturing procedures.  \n \n\nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 2 of 6  \n \nThis procedure has many benefits. It would ensure that waste aerosol cans are managed at \nall stages of accumulation in compliance with universal waste h andler or hazardous waste \ngenerator standards. It allows facilities to limit the amount of personnel that must be trained.  If \nthe proposed procedure were not permitted, the generator would have to train every individual \nwho uses aerosol cans to operate th e puncture device. Alternatively, if universal waste \naccumulation prior to puncturing is permitted, generators would be able to leave the important \ntask of puncturing to a select few with sufficient training and experience. The proposed \nprocedure would als o allow facilities to minimize process interruptions associated with aerosol \ncan puncturing. While process interruptions may occur whenever an aerosol can is expended, \nthese interruptions would be minimized if a facility can consolidate the cans and punctu res them \nat a separate time.  \n \nNucor does not read the rule to prohibit generators from combining these approaches. \nNucor requests clarification from EPA that this approach is acceptable. Nucor also requests that \nEPA confirm that quantities of universal wa ste storage of aerosol cans near a puncturing device \nwould not go toward the 55 -gallon limit for satellite accumulation areas. Instead, only the \nresiduals collected in the puncturing device would go toward that 55 -gallon limitation.  \n \n2. EPA should clarify th at hazardous waste generators may rely on the statements  of the \naerosol can puncture device and filter manufacturers.  \nUnder the proposed rule, generators must use a \u201c commercial device specifically designed \nto safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively c ontain the residual contents and any emissions \nthereof .\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(i), 273.33(e)(3)(i) (proposed).   In the preamble discussion of \nthis requirement, EPA asserts it is the operator\u2019s responsibility to ensure VOC \u201c breakthrough is \nnot occurrin g.\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 .  \n \nNucor does not believe generators are in the best position to question the accuracy of a \nfilter manufacturer\u2019s representations. Manufacturers already provide parameters to assist \ngenerators in determining filter efficacy. Thes e include numerical recommendations (e.g., 600 -\n700 punctured cans per filter) or visual indicators on the filters themselves. The rule should \nauthorize generators to rely on these representations. Without this ability, generators of aerosol \ncan waste that wish to puncture cans will have to choose between relying on manufacturer \nrecommendations at their own peril, adopting an extremely conservative VOC filter change \nschedule, installing sensors to continually monitor the carbon filter exhaust, or adopting \nprocedures to weigh the carbon filter before and during use to determine when it has reached \ncapacity.  This will disincentivize many generators from taking advantage of the puncturing \nallowance. As such, it is contrary to EPA\u2019s goal to \u201c ease regulatory burde ns\u201d and \u201cpromote the \ncollection and recycling\u201d of aerosol cans. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11654.  \n \nEPA routinely authorizes operators to rely on manufacturer recommendations. For \nexample, EPA has permitted generators to rely on safety data sheets compiled by manufac turers \nto make hazardous waste determinations. See, e.g., 81 Fed. Reg. 85732, 85750 (explaining that \n\u201ca review of an SDS may suffice because the identification of the constituents and their \nconcentration ranges may make it clear whether the chemical is or is not a hazardous waste upon \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 3 of 6  \n \ndisposal \u201d). Additionally, under Part 265, Subpart CC, an owner or operator may open a \u201csafety \ndevice\u201d (e.g., a pressure relief valve) on a container containing hazardous waste whenever \u201c the \ninternal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable \nto the air emission control equipment  as determined by the owner or operator based on \nmanufacturer recommendations \u201d or other factors. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1087(c)(3)(v) ; Id. \u00a7 265.1081 \n(emphasi s added) .  \n \nEPA has authorized similar practices in the air context. See,e.g.,  Id. \u00a7 63.11516  (requiring \noperators to operate all equipment, including pollution control equipment, related to dry abrasive \nblasting, machining, dry grinding and polishing, spr ay painting, and welding according to \nmanufacturer\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cspecifications\u201d); Id. \u00a7\u00a7 63.773, 63.1283  (requiring the \ninspection and maintenance plan for each control device to contain the \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s  \nrecommendations for ensuring proper oper ation of the device\u201d); Id. \u00a7 60.258 (requiring operators \nto certify that the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations were followed for the dust suppressant \nsystem) . \n \nThese examples demonstrate that EPA does not have inherent trepidation about relying \non manufacture r statements. Instead, EPA has apparently determined that reliance on \nmanufacturers in this context is not appropriate. However, according to EPA\u2019s own admission, \nthe agency has only subjected a single aerosol can puncturing solution to scrutiny under the  \nEnvironmental Technology Verification program. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 . This is not a sufficient \nbasis to shift the burden of verifying equipment efficacy to users of the product. If EPA suspects \nthat additional verification of manufacturer statements is nee ded, it should direct its efforts \ntowards those manufacturers, not the individual users.  \n \nFor these reasons, Nucor requests EPA amend the proposed rule to allow generators to \nrely on manufacturer recommendations, both in the form of visual indicators of f ilter status and \nquantitative parameters.  \n \n3. EPA should not establish further limitations on puncturing and draining of aerosol \ncans . \nWhen a generator punctures an aerosol can, any residuals collected that qualify as \nhazardous waste are subject to all existing regulations in Parts 260 through 272. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.13(e)(3)(v), 273.33(e)(3)(v) (proposed).   Parts 260 through 272 sufficiently address \nconcerns raised by EPA and states regarding puncturing of certain types of aerosol can products. \nThe concerns raised include incompatibility and the hazardous nature of the contents  of certain \ncans. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 -62. \n \nIncompatibility. Generators of hazardous waste are already subject to stringent \ncompatibility standards. To address the risk that certain components of the puncture station may \nbe incompatible with aerosol can contents, current regulations re quire generators to \u201c use a \ncontainer made of or lined with materials that will not react with, and are otherwise compatible \nwith, the hazardous waste to be accumulated, so that the ability of the container to contain the \nwaste is not impaired. \u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 262.15(a)(2) ; see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 262.16(b)(2)(ii), \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 4 of 6  \n \n262.17(a)(1)(iii).  To address other incompatibility risks, existing regulations prohibit \n\u201c[i]ncompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials \u201d from being \u201c placed in the same \ncontaine r,\u201d except unde r limited circumstances. Id. \u00a7 262.15(a)(3); see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 \n262.16(b)(2)(v), 262.17(a)(1)(vii). Additional incompatibility provisions apply to central \naccumulation areas. Id. Moreover, the proposed rule requires a written procedure that addresses \nsegregat ion of incompatible wastes. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) (proposed).   \n  \nHazard ous Contents . No prohibitions are warranted due to the hazardous nature of the \ncontents of certain cans. The proposed regulations require a written procedure d etailing how to \n\u201csafely\u201d puncture and drain aerosol cans.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) \n(proposed).  Thus, if it is unsafe to puncture a certain type of product, the existing rules already \nprohibit this.  Because the residual must be subje cted to a hazardous waste determination and \nmanaged accordingly, all hazardous residuals are also required to be managed safely and \nresponsibly under existing regulations. Of course, if EPA has information indicating certain \nproducts present greater safety  risks than others, it should make this information available so that \nthe regulated community may make an informed decision as to whether its written procedures \nare adequate.  In the extreme case that a product cannot be punctured safely under any \ncircumsta nces, Nucor would support a ban on puncturing that product.  \n \n4. Any puncture prohibition for commercial processors should not apply to co -generated \nhazardous waste or LQGs receiving VSQG waste under 262.17(f).  \nEPA has solicited comment on whether it should ban commercial processors from taking \nadvantage of the puncturing allowance as California has in its universal waste rule. 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. Nucor is concerned that California\u2019s puncturing prohibition  is overbroad . California\u2019s \nban applies to all comm ercial processors, a term EPA interprets to mean any \u201c person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation .\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. According to California guidance, commercial processors  include \u201cindividuals from \nanother generator\u2019s site .\u201d  See California Department of Toxic Substances Control, Aerosol Can \nWaste Management , at 3 (Oct. 2015).  \n \nNucor does not believe the  puncturing  prohibition should apply to hazardous waste co -\ngenerators or LQGs managing VSQG waste under the consolidation provisions at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n262.17(f)  (the \u201cconsolidation rule\u201d) . Thus, if EPA adopts a puncturing ban for commercial \nprocessors, it should specifi cally exclude these entities from the commercial processor definition.  \n \nCo-generated  Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d \nbecause it punctures aerosol cans of a co -generator or other related entity.  \n \nUnder EPA\u2019s longstandi ng co -generation policy, hazardous waste co -generation occurs \nwhen two or more parties satisfy the \u201cgenerator\u201d definition for a single waste stream. 45 Fed. \nReg. 72024, 72026 (Oct. 30, 1980) .  This policy encourages cooperation among co -generators to \nensur e proper management. As co -generators of a single waste stream, facilities may agree to \nshift responsibility for waste management to a single generator.  Id. Similarly, if multiple entities \nare involved in the waste generation process, but only one party me ets the technical definition of \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 5 of 6  \n \nhazardous waste generator,  EPA\u2019s policy is to allow either party to assume the generator \nresponsibilities, so long as the true generator\u2019s EPA I.D. number is used. RO 11372.  \n \nMultiple generators may be involved in generating  aerosol can waste  at a single facility . \nFor example, a contractor hired by a manufacturer to perform maintenance at the facility uses \naerosol products required for the maintenance activity.  Under this scenario, both the \nmanufacturer and the contractor ma y be considered hazardous waste generator s of the aerosol \ncan waste stream . Regardless, b oth parties have a role in the hazardous waste generation process \nand a stake in how the waste is managed.  To increase the likelihood of proper management, the \nco-gene rator policy allow s either the manufacturer or the contractor to assume generator \nresponsibilities for the aerosol can waste.  \n \nUnder California\u2019s interpretation, the generator assuming responsibility for the waste \nmay be considered a commercial processor.  Goods and/or services are being exchanged, and one \nbenefit of that bargain may include the agreement to manage the waste generated.  EPA should \nnot adopt a rule that would reach this conclusion. Doing so would prevent co -generated aerosol \ncans from being managed under the puncturing guidelines, discourage co -generation agreements, \nand reduce the overall likelihood that waste aerosol cans will be managed properly. On the other \nhand, if EPA exempts these types of entities from the commercial processor defini tion, it will \nensure that the more capable generator assumes the hazardous waste generator responsibilities \nand provide greater protection against risks to the environment and human health.  \n \nNucor thus requests that EPA adopt a definition of commercial pro cessor that would \nallow  co-generators or  entities  similarly related  to cooperatively manage  aerosol can waste \nstreams under the puncturing procedure.  \n \nLQG -VSQG Consolidated Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial \nprocessor\u201d because it punctures aerosol cans received from a related VSQG under the \nconsolidation rule .  \n \nUnder the consolidation rule , LQGs  \u201cmay accumulate on site hazardous waste received \nfrom very small  quantity generators under control of the same person \u201d provided certain \nconditions are met.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 262.17(f). When EPA adopted this standard, it determined it \nwould \u201ci mprove overall tracking, oversight and management of the hazardous waste \u201d; reduce \n\u201coverall waste management costs\u201d; reduce \u201cpotential financial liabilities\u201d; \u201cincrease potential \nopportunities for hazardous waste recycling\u201d; \u201c reduce the overall time that the VSQG \naccumulates hazardous waste on site \u201d; \u201cgive companies flexibility in allocat ing labor and \nresource s\u201d; and \u201c reduce the potential risk to human health and the environment .\u201d 81 Fed. Reg. \n85732, 85773  (Nov. 28, 2016).  \n \nEPA must be careful to preserve these benefits.  Because an LQG receiving VSQG waste \nwould be an \u201cindividual from an other generator\u2019s site,\u201d the LQG may qualify as a commercial \nprocessor under California\u2019s existing program, which would prevent it from enjoying the \nbenefits of the consolidation rule.  We do not believe this is EPA\u2019s intent and thus urge the \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 6 of 6  \n \nagency to cle arly exempt LQGs managing VSQG waste under 262.17(f) from any enacted \nprohibition.  \n \nConclusion  \n \n In general, Nucor is supportive of EPA\u2019s proposed rule. Nucor appreciates the \nopportunity to express these concerns  and looks forward to EPA\u2019s response.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nBrandon Curtis  \nAttorney for Nucor Corporation  \n\n"

Additionally, under Part 265, Subpart CC, an owner or operator may open a \u201csafety \ndevice\u201d (e.g., a pressure relief valve) on a container containing hazardous waste whenever \u201c the \ninternal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable \nto the air emission control equipment  as determined by the owner or operator based on \nmanufacturer recommendations \u201d or other factors. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1087(c)(3)(v) ; Id. \u00a7 265.1081 \n(emphasi s added) .  \n \nEPA has authorized similar practices in the air context. See,e.g.,  Id. \u00a7 63.11516  (requiring \noperators to operate all equipment, including pollution control equipment, related to dry abrasive \nblasting, machining, dry grinding and polishing, spr ay painting, and welding according to \nmanufacturer\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cspecifications\u201d); Id. \u00a7\u00a7 63.773, 63.1283  (requiring the \ninspection and maintenance plan for each control device to contain the \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s  \nrecommendations for ensuring proper oper ation of the device\u201d); Id. \u00a7 60.258 (requiring operators \nto certify that the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations were followed for the dust suppressant \nsystem) . \n \nThese examples demonstrate that EPA does not have inherent trepidation about relying \non manufacture r statements. Instead, EPA has apparently determined that reliance on \nmanufacturers in this context is not appropriate. However, according to EPA\u2019s own admission, \nthe agency has only subjected a single aerosol can puncturing solution to scrutiny under the  \nEnvironmental Technology Verification program. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 . This is not a sufficient \nbasis to shift the burden of verifying equipment efficacy to users of the product. If EPA suspects \nthat additional verification of manufacturer statements is nee ded, it should direct its efforts \ntowards those manufacturers, not the individual users.  \n \nFor these reasons, Nucor requests EPA amend the proposed rule to allow generators to \nrely on manufacturer recommendations, both in the form of visual indicators of f ilter status and \nquantitative parameters.  \n \n3. EPA should not establish further limitations on puncturing and draining of aerosol \ncans . \nWhen a generator punctures an aerosol can, any residuals collected that qualify as \nhazardous waste are subject to all existing regulations in Parts 260 through 272. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.13(e)(3)(v), 273.33(e)(3)(v) (proposed).   Parts 260 through 272 sufficiently address \nconcerns raised by EPA and states regarding puncturing of certain types of aerosol can products. \nThe concerns raised include incompatibility and the hazardous nature of the contents  of certain \ncans. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 -62. \n \nIncompatibility. Generators of hazardous waste are already subject to stringent \ncompatibility standards. To address the risk that certain components of the puncture station may \nbe incompatible with aerosol can contents, current regulations re quire generators to \u201c use a \ncontainer made of or lined with materials that will not react with, and are otherwise compatible \nwith, the hazardous waste to be accumulated, so that the ability of the container to contain the \nwaste is not impaired. \u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 262.15(a)(2) ; see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 262.16(b)(2)(ii), \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 4 of 6  \n \n262.17(a)(1)(iii).  To address other incompatibility risks, existing regulations prohibit \n\u201c[i]ncompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials \u201d from being \u201c placed in the same \ncontaine r,\u201d except unde r limited circumstances. Id. \u00a7 262.15(a)(3); see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 \n262.16(b)(2)(v), 262.17(a)(1)(vii). Additional incompatibility provisions apply to central \naccumulation areas. Id. Moreover, the proposed rule requires a written procedure that addresses \nsegregat ion of incompatible wastes. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) (proposed).   \n  \nHazard ous Contents . No prohibitions are warranted due to the hazardous nature of the \ncontents of certain cans. The proposed regulations require a written procedure d etailing how to \n\u201csafely\u201d puncture and drain aerosol cans.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) \n(proposed).  Thus, if it is unsafe to puncture a certain type of product, the existing rules already \nprohibit this.  Because the residual must be subje cted to a hazardous waste determination and \nmanaged accordingly, all hazardous residuals are also required to be managed safely and \nresponsibly under existing regulations. Of course, if EPA has information indicating certain \nproducts present greater safety  risks than others, it should make this information available so that \nthe regulated community may make an informed decision as to whether its written procedures \nare adequate.  In the extreme case that a product cannot be punctured safely under any \ncircumsta nces, Nucor would support a ban on puncturing that product.  \n \n4. Any puncture prohibition for commercial processors should not apply to co -generated \nhazardous waste or LQGs receiving VSQG waste under 262.17(f).  \nEPA has solicited comment on whether it should ban commercial processors from taking \nadvantage of the puncturing allowance as California has in its universal waste rule. 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. Nucor is concerned that California\u2019s puncturing prohibition  is overbroad . California\u2019s \nban applies to all comm ercial processors, a term EPA interprets to mean any \u201c person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation .\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. According to California guidance, commercial processors  include \u201cindividuals from \nanother generator\u2019s site .\u201d  See California Department of Toxic Substances Control, Aerosol Can \nWaste Management , at 3 (Oct. 2015).  \n \nNucor does not believe the  puncturing  prohibition should apply to hazardous waste co -\ngenerators or LQGs managing VSQG waste under the consolidation provisions at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n262.17(f)  (the \u201cconsolidation rule\u201d) . Thus, if EPA adopts a puncturing ban for commercial \nprocessors, it should specifi cally exclude these entities from the commercial processor definition.  \n \nCo-generated  Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d \nbecause it punctures aerosol cans of a co -generator or other related entity.  \n \nUnder EPA\u2019s longstandi ng co -generation policy, hazardous waste co -generation occurs \nwhen two or more parties satisfy the \u201cgenerator\u201d definition for a single waste stream. 45 Fed. \nReg. 72024, 72026 (Oct. 30, 1980) .  This policy encourages cooperation among co -generators to \nensur e proper management. As co -generators of a single waste stream, facilities may agree to \nshift responsibility for waste management to a single generator.  Id. Similarly, if multiple entities \nare involved in the waste generation process, but only one party me ets the technical definition of \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 5 of 6  \n \nhazardous waste generator,  EPA\u2019s policy is to allow either party to assume the generator \nresponsibilities, so long as the true generator\u2019s EPA I.D. number is used. RO 11372.  \n \nMultiple generators may be involved in generating  aerosol can waste  at a single facility . \nFor example, a contractor hired by a manufacturer to perform maintenance at the facility uses \naerosol products required for the maintenance activity.  Under this scenario, both the \nmanufacturer and the contractor ma y be considered hazardous waste generator s of the aerosol \ncan waste stream . Regardless, b oth parties have a role in the hazardous waste generation process \nand a stake in how the waste is managed.  To increase the likelihood of proper management, the \nco-gene rator policy allow s either the manufacturer or the contractor to assume generator \nresponsibilities for the aerosol can waste.  \n \nUnder California\u2019s interpretation, the generator assuming responsibility for the waste \nmay be considered a commercial processor.  Goods and/or services are being exchanged, and one \nbenefit of that bargain may include the agreement to manage the waste generated.  EPA should \nnot adopt a rule that would reach this conclusion. Doing so would prevent co -generated aerosol \ncans from being managed under the puncturing guidelines, discourage co -generation agreements, \nand reduce the overall likelihood that waste aerosol cans will be managed properly. On the other \nhand, if EPA exempts these types of entities from the commercial processor defini tion, it will \nensure that the more capable generator assumes the hazardous waste generator responsibilities \nand provide greater protection against risks to the environment and human health.  \n \nNucor thus requests that EPA adopt a definition of commercial pro cessor that would \nallow  co-generators or  entities  similarly related  to cooperatively manage  aerosol can waste \nstreams under the puncturing procedure.  \n \nLQG -VSQG Consolidated Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial \nprocessor\u201d because it punctures aerosol cans received from a related VSQG under the \nconsolidation rule .  \n \nUnder the consolidation rule , LQGs  \u201cmay accumulate on site hazardous waste received \nfrom very small  quantity generators under control of the same person \u201d provided certain \nconditions are met.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 262.17(f). When EPA adopted this standard, it determined it \nwould \u201ci mprove overall tracking, oversight and management of the hazardous waste \u201d; reduce \n\u201coverall waste management costs\u201d; reduce \u201cpotential financial liabilities\u201d; \u201cincrease potential \nopportunities for hazardous waste recycling\u201d; \u201c reduce the overall time that the VSQG \naccumulates hazardous waste on site \u201d; \u201cgive companies flexibility in allocat ing labor and \nresource s\u201d; and \u201c reduce the potential risk to human health and the environment .\u201d 81 Fed. Reg. \n85732, 85773  (Nov. 28, 2016).  \n \nEPA must be careful to preserve these benefits.  Because an LQG receiving VSQG waste \nwould be an \u201cindividual from an other generator\u2019s site,\u201d the LQG may qualify as a commercial \nprocessor under California\u2019s existing program, which would prevent it from enjoying the \nbenefits of the consolidation rule.  We do not believe this is EPA\u2019s intent and thus urge the \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 6 of 6  \n \nagency to cle arly exempt LQGs managing VSQG waste under 262.17(f) from any enacted \nprohibition.  \n \nConclusion  \n \n In general, Nucor is supportive of EPA\u2019s proposed rule. Nucor appreciates the \nopportunity to express these concerns  and looks forward to EPA\u2019s response.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nBrandon Curtis  \nAttorney for Nucor Corporation  \n\n"

EPA, \u201c Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal \nWaste Regulations ,\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11654 (Mar. 16, 2018).  \n \nNucor is engaged in steel manufacturing and steel product manufacturing and fabrication \nthroughout the Country. To support these processes, Nucor uses various aerosol c an products. \nAfter use, these products become waste and would be subject to EPA\u2019s proposal.  In general, \nNucor is supportive of EPA\u2019s proposed rule. Managing aerosol cans as universal waste will ease \nthe regulatory burden of handling this waste stream whil e ensuring requisite environmental \nprotection. Moreover, codifying EPA\u2019s longstanding policy to allow aerosol can puncturing \nprovides needed certainty to the regulated community. Nucor has the following comments \nrequesting clarification on the applicabilit y and scope of the rule.  \n \n1. EPA should clarify that waste aerosol cans may be accumulated as universal waste \nprior to puncturing.  \nNucor understands the rule to offer two aerosol can management solutions. First, a \ngenerator may manage intact aerosol cans as  universal waste. Second, a generator may puncture \nand recycle the aerosol cans , collect the residuals, subject them to a hazardous waste \ndetermination and manage them accordingly.  \n \nNeither the preamble nor the proposed regulatory language directly addres ses the \nacceptability of combining these approaches. Under a common scenario, a generator would \ninitially collect intact, expended aerosol cans in a universal waste container. Then, once a \nsufficient amount has collected, a RCRA -trained operator would remo ve the cans from universal \nwaste management and subject them to the authorized puncturing procedures.  \n \n\nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 2 of 6  \n \nThis procedure has many benefits. It would ensure that waste aerosol cans are managed at \nall stages of accumulation in compliance with universal waste h andler or hazardous waste \ngenerator standards. It allows facilities to limit the amount of personnel that must be trained.  If \nthe proposed procedure were not permitted, the generator would have to train every individual \nwho uses aerosol cans to operate th e puncture device. Alternatively, if universal waste \naccumulation prior to puncturing is permitted, generators would be able to leave the important \ntask of puncturing to a select few with sufficient training and experience. The proposed \nprocedure would als o allow facilities to minimize process interruptions associated with aerosol \ncan puncturing. While process interruptions may occur whenever an aerosol can is expended, \nthese interruptions would be minimized if a facility can consolidate the cans and punctu res them \nat a separate time.  \n \nNucor does not read the rule to prohibit generators from combining these approaches. \nNucor requests clarification from EPA that this approach is acceptable. Nucor also requests that \nEPA confirm that quantities of universal wa ste storage of aerosol cans near a puncturing device \nwould not go toward the 55 -gallon limit for satellite accumulation areas. Instead, only the \nresiduals collected in the puncturing device would go toward that 55 -gallon limitation.  \n \n2. EPA should clarify th at hazardous waste generators may rely on the statements  of the \naerosol can puncture device and filter manufacturers.  \nUnder the proposed rule, generators must use a \u201c commercial device specifically designed \nto safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively c ontain the residual contents and any emissions \nthereof .\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(i), 273.33(e)(3)(i) (proposed).   In the preamble discussion of \nthis requirement, EPA asserts it is the operator\u2019s responsibility to ensure VOC \u201c breakthrough is \nnot occurrin g.\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 .  \n \nNucor does not believe generators are in the best position to question the accuracy of a \nfilter manufacturer\u2019s representations. Manufacturers already provide parameters to assist \ngenerators in determining filter efficacy. Thes e include numerical recommendations (e.g., 600 -\n700 punctured cans per filter) or visual indicators on the filters themselves. The rule should \nauthorize generators to rely on these representations. Without this ability, generators of aerosol \ncan waste that wish to puncture cans will have to choose between relying on manufacturer \nrecommendations at their own peril, adopting an extremely conservative VOC filter change \nschedule, installing sensors to continually monitor the carbon filter exhaust, or adopting \nprocedures to weigh the carbon filter before and during use to determine when it has reached \ncapacity.  This will disincentivize many generators from taking advantage of the puncturing \nallowance. As such, it is contrary to EPA\u2019s goal to \u201c ease regulatory burde ns\u201d and \u201cpromote the \ncollection and recycling\u201d of aerosol cans. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11654.  \n \nEPA routinely authorizes operators to rely on manufacturer recommendations. For \nexample, EPA has permitted generators to rely on safety data sheets compiled by manufac turers \nto make hazardous waste determinations. See, e.g., 81 Fed. Reg. 85732, 85750 (explaining that \n\u201ca review of an SDS may suffice because the identification of the constituents and their \nconcentration ranges may make it clear whether the chemical is or is not a hazardous waste upon \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 3 of 6  \n \ndisposal \u201d). Additionally, under Part 265, Subpart CC, an owner or operator may open a \u201csafety \ndevice\u201d (e.g., a pressure relief valve) on a container containing hazardous waste whenever \u201c the \ninternal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable \nto the air emission control equipment  as determined by the owner or operator based on \nmanufacturer recommendations \u201d or other factors. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 265.1087(c)(3)(v) ; Id. \u00a7 265.1081 \n(emphasi s added) .  \n \nEPA has authorized similar practices in the air context. See,e.g.,  Id. \u00a7 63.11516  (requiring \noperators to operate all equipment, including pollution control equipment, related to dry abrasive \nblasting, machining, dry grinding and polishing, spr ay painting, and welding according to \nmanufacturer\u2019s \u201cinstructions\u201d and \u201cspecifications\u201d); Id. \u00a7\u00a7 63.773, 63.1283  (requiring the \ninspection and maintenance plan for each control device to contain the \u201cmanufacturer\u2019s  \nrecommendations for ensuring proper oper ation of the device\u201d); Id. \u00a7 60.258 (requiring operators \nto certify that the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations were followed for the dust suppressant \nsystem) . \n \nThese examples demonstrate that EPA does not have inherent trepidation about relying \non manufacture r statements. Instead, EPA has apparently determined that reliance on \nmanufacturers in this context is not appropriate. However, according to EPA\u2019s own admission, \nthe agency has only subjected a single aerosol can puncturing solution to scrutiny under the  \nEnvironmental Technology Verification program. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 . This is not a sufficient \nbasis to shift the burden of verifying equipment efficacy to users of the product. If EPA suspects \nthat additional verification of manufacturer statements is nee ded, it should direct its efforts \ntowards those manufacturers, not the individual users.  \n \nFor these reasons, Nucor requests EPA amend the proposed rule to allow generators to \nrely on manufacturer recommendations, both in the form of visual indicators of f ilter status and \nquantitative parameters.  \n \n3. EPA should not establish further limitations on puncturing and draining of aerosol \ncans . \nWhen a generator punctures an aerosol can, any residuals collected that qualify as \nhazardous waste are subject to all existing regulations in Parts 260 through 272. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n273.13(e)(3)(v), 273.33(e)(3)(v) (proposed).   Parts 260 through 272 sufficiently address \nconcerns raised by EPA and states regarding puncturing of certain types of aerosol can products. \nThe concerns raised include incompatibility and the hazardous nature of the contents  of certain \ncans. 83 Fed. Reg. at 11661 -62. \n \nIncompatibility. Generators of hazardous waste are already subject to stringent \ncompatibility standards. To address the risk that certain components of the puncture station may \nbe incompatible with aerosol can contents, current regulations re quire generators to \u201c use a \ncontainer made of or lined with materials that will not react with, and are otherwise compatible \nwith, the hazardous waste to be accumulated, so that the ability of the container to contain the \nwaste is not impaired. \u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 262.15(a)(2) ; see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 262.16(b)(2)(ii), \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 4 of 6  \n \n262.17(a)(1)(iii).  To address other incompatibility risks, existing regulations prohibit \n\u201c[i]ncompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials \u201d from being \u201c placed in the same \ncontaine r,\u201d except unde r limited circumstances. Id. \u00a7 262.15(a)(3); see also Id. \u00a7\u00a7 \n262.16(b)(2)(v), 262.17(a)(1)(vii). Additional incompatibility provisions apply to central \naccumulation areas. Id. Moreover, the proposed rule requires a written procedure that addresses \nsegregat ion of incompatible wastes. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) (proposed).   \n  \nHazard ous Contents . No prohibitions are warranted due to the hazardous nature of the \ncontents of certain cans. The proposed regulations require a written procedure d etailing how to \n\u201csafely\u201d puncture and drain aerosol cans.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.13(e)(3)(ii), 273.33(e)(3)(ii) \n(proposed).  Thus, if it is unsafe to puncture a certain type of product, the existing rules already \nprohibit this.  Because the residual must be subje cted to a hazardous waste determination and \nmanaged accordingly, all hazardous residuals are also required to be managed safely and \nresponsibly under existing regulations. Of course, if EPA has information indicating certain \nproducts present greater safety  risks than others, it should make this information available so that \nthe regulated community may make an informed decision as to whether its written procedures \nare adequate.  In the extreme case that a product cannot be punctured safely under any \ncircumsta nces, Nucor would support a ban on puncturing that product.  \n \n4. Any puncture prohibition for commercial processors should not apply to co -generated \nhazardous waste or LQGs receiving VSQG waste under 262.17(f).  \nEPA has solicited comment on whether it should ban commercial processors from taking \nadvantage of the puncturing allowance as California has in its universal waste rule. 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. Nucor is concerned that California\u2019s puncturing prohibition  is overbroad . California\u2019s \nban applies to all comm ercial processors, a term EPA interprets to mean any \u201c person that \nprocesses aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation .\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. \nat 11662. According to California guidance, commercial processors  include \u201cindividuals from \nanother generator\u2019s site .\u201d  See California Department of Toxic Substances Control, Aerosol Can \nWaste Management , at 3 (Oct. 2015).  \n \nNucor does not believe the  puncturing  prohibition should apply to hazardous waste co -\ngenerators or LQGs managing VSQG waste under the consolidation provisions at 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 \n262.17(f)  (the \u201cconsolidation rule\u201d) . Thus, if EPA adopts a puncturing ban for commercial \nprocessors, it should specifi cally exclude these entities from the commercial processor definition.  \n \nCo-generated  Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d \nbecause it punctures aerosol cans of a co -generator or other related entity.  \n \nUnder EPA\u2019s longstandi ng co -generation policy, hazardous waste co -generation occurs \nwhen two or more parties satisfy the \u201cgenerator\u201d definition for a single waste stream. 45 Fed. \nReg. 72024, 72026 (Oct. 30, 1980) .  This policy encourages cooperation among co -generators to \nensur e proper management. As co -generators of a single waste stream, facilities may agree to \nshift responsibility for waste management to a single generator.  Id. Similarly, if multiple entities \nare involved in the waste generation process, but only one party me ets the technical definition of \nComments on Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nMay 15, 2018  \nPage 5 of 6  \n \nhazardous waste generator,  EPA\u2019s policy is to allow either party to assume the generator \nresponsibilities, so long as the true generator\u2019s EPA I.D. number is used. RO 11372.  \n \nMultiple generators may be involved in generating  aerosol can waste  at a single facility . \nFor example, a contractor hired by a manufacturer to perform maintenance at the facility uses \naerosol products required for the maintenance activity.  Under this scenario, both the \nmanufacturer and the contractor ma y be considered hazardous waste generator s of the aerosol \ncan waste stream . Regardless, b oth parties have a role in the hazardous waste generation process \nand a stake in how the waste is managed.  To increase the likelihood of proper management, the \nco-gene rator policy allow s either the manufacturer or the contractor to assume generator \nresponsibilities for the aerosol can waste.  \n \nUnder California\u2019s interpretation, the generator assuming responsibility for the waste \nmay be considered a commercial processor.  Goods and/or services are being exchanged, and one \nbenefit of that bargain may include the agreement to manage the waste generated.  EPA should \nnot adopt a rule that would reach this conclusion. Doing so would prevent co -generated aerosol \ncans from being managed under the puncturing guidelines, discourage co -generation agreements, \nand reduce the overall likelihood that waste aerosol cans will be managed properly. On the other \nhand, if EPA exempts these types of entities from the commercial processor defini tion, it will \nensure that the more capable generator assumes the hazardous waste generator responsibilities \nand provide greater protection against risks to the environment and human health.  \n \nNucor thus requests that EPA adopt a definition of commercial pro cessor that would \nallow  co-generators or  entities  similarly related  to cooperatively manage  aerosol can waste \nstreams under the puncturing procedure.  \n \nLQG -VSQG Consolidated Waste . A generator should not be considered a \u201ccommercial \nprocessor\u201d because it punctures aerosol cans received from a related VSQG under the \nconsolidation rule .  \n \nUnder the consolidation rule , LQGs  \u201cmay accumulate on site hazardous waste received \nfrom very small  quantity generators under control of the same person \u201d provided certain \nconditions are met.  40 C.F.R. \u00a7 262.17(f). When EPA adopted this standard, it determined it \nwould \u201ci mprove overall tracking, oversight and management of the hazardous waste \u201d; reduce \n\u201coverall waste management costs\u201d; reduce \u201cpotential financial liabilities\u201d; \u201cincrease potential \nopportunities for hazardous waste recycling\u201d; \u201c reduce the overall time that the VSQG \naccumulates hazardous waste on site \u201d; \u201cgive companies flexibility in allocat ing labor and \nresource s\u201d; and \u201c reduce the potential risk to human health and the environment .\u201d 81 Fed.

General Comment \nOhio EPA adopted state-specific universal waste rules in December 2017 classifying non-empty \naerosol containers as a universal waste. A copy of Ohio's universal waste aerosol container rules \nfor large quantity handlers is attached for your review and consideration in developing U.S. EPA's \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol cans, Ohio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33 (D). \n2. 40 CFR 260.10-Definition of Aerosol Can \nOhio EPA suggests that the term \"can\" be replaced with the term \"container \" to make it clear that \nproducts packaged in plastic aerosol containers are eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nThe term \"can\" strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the applicability of the \ndefinition and excludes plastic containers from \nbeing eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nPlastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently aren't as prevalent in \nthe marketplace as metal aerosol containers . Plastic aerosol container can be used to package: \n\u2022 Personal care -shaving gels & foams, hair care, body moisturizers \n\u2022 Home care -air fresheners , cleaning applications , insecticides \n\u2022 Food -oils, cooking mists, creams and sauces \n\u2022 Industrial applications \nIn addition, the definition of aerosol can needs to be clarified to exclude compressed gas cylinders \nand to include aerosol gels such as shaving cream. Ohio EPA suggests the following definition : \n\"Aerosol container\" means a non-opening , non-refillable container that holds a substance \nunder pressure and that can release the substance as a spray, gel, or foam by means of \na propellant gas. \n3. 40 CFR 273.4 (b)(4)-Leaking or damaged aerosol cans \nU.S. EPA proposes to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from being classified and \nmanaged as universal wastes. Ohio EPA does not support this proposal. Ohio EPA supports \nthat leaking or damaged aerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal \nwastes. \nExcluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste program complicates \nimplementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the rule less \nunderstandable . Also, the exclusion of leaking/damaged cans it offers minimal additiona l \nenvironmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules. The universal \nwaste rules are consistent to the hazardous waste generator rules in that a handler is required to: \n\u2022 use an appropriate, structurally sound and compatible container ; \n1 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No. \n-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\u2022 label the container regarding its contents; \n\u2022 limit storage time of aerosol cans to one year; \n\u2022 transport the cans according to U.S. DOT's applicable transportation rules; \n\u2022 Maintain a spill cleanup procedure and equipment ; and \n\u2022 train personnel regarding the proper procedure to handle, puncture and drain aerosol \ncans, and respond to releases. \nFurther, under Ohio EPA's universal waste program, both leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nand punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal waste. Ohio EPA \nspecifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol container in its recently adopted \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nto be overpacked with absorbent or immediately punctured to remove the contents of the \ncontainer . Ohio EPA believes that allowing leaking, damaged and punctured aerosol containers \nto remain eligible to be \nmanaged as universal wastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal \nof the waste and provides for an easily understood regulatory system for aerosol containers . \nOhio EPA's universal waste, Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 3745-273-13 and 3745-273-\n33 state: \n\"A large quantity handler of universal waste shall immediately empty a leaking aerosol \ncontainer of the container 's contents in accordance with paragraph (E) (4) of this rule or \nshall individually overpack the leaking aerosol container in a container having enough \nabsorbent material to absorb the leaking contents of the aerosol container .\" \n4. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(1)-Grammar check \nPlease check grammar\n; change second use of the term \"cans\" to \"can.\" \n5. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2)-Aerosol cans are not categorically reactive hazardous wastes \nOhio EPA suggests that \nU.S. EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clear \nto the regulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes. Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated resulting in the release of the contents from the can that the aerosol \ncan is a reactive hazardous waste. However, such an occurrence does not meet the definition of \na reactive hazardous waste. Any material in a sealed container , be it a container of milk or a \ndrum of waste, will burst if overheated . U.S. EPA provides a good explanation of this physical \nphenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably in the rule, \nthat aerosol cans are \nnot reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the container actually \nmeets the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23. \nOhio EPA addressed the issue of reactivity in OAC rule 3745-273-89 as follows: \n2 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\"Aerosol containers that are not a hazardous waste. An aerosol container is a hazardous \nwaste if the contents of the container exhibit one or more of the characteristics identified \nin rules 3745-51-20 to 3745-51-24 of the Administrative Code, or if the contents of the \ncontainer are listed in rules 3745-51-30 to 3745-51-35 of the Administrative Code. An \naerosol container is not a reactive hazardous waste unless the contents meet the \ndescription of \"reactivity\" in rule 3745-51-23 of the Administrative Code.\" \nIn addition, the definition of reactivity states \"a waste exhibits the characteristic or reactivity ... if it \nis capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if \nheated under confinement. \" Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382. It is important to note that \ndetonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions. An explosive reaction is a chemical \nreaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a substance occurs thereby releasing hot \ngases which exert great pressure on the surroundings. Detonation is also an explosive reaction \nin which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the speed of sound. An \noverheated container that bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is physical phenomenon where the \nstructural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure exerted by the heated \ncontents in the container. \nFurther, the definition of reactivity was \"intended to identify wastes, that because of their extreme \ninstability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of the waste \nmanagement process, 45 FR 33109. It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this type of \nhazard. A potential hazard an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content is released \n(even during normal use) and an ignition source is present. \n6. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2) \nPlease check this rule for clarity. It appears that the words \"contents of the\" should appear before \n\"aerosol can\" otherwise , only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine if it is a \ncharacteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can. \n7. Page 11660-Empty container \nU.S. EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal. This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement. Yes, a container that meets the definition of empty is not \nsubject to the hazardous waste regulations . What is misleading about the statement is that the \naerosol can must be RCRA empty, per40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal. \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6. Scrap metal is a \"recyclable material\" and \n\"recyclable material\" is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled. Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P-listed waste) to be \nclassified and recycled as scrap metal. However, it is a good management practice to remove as \nmuch of the waste from the aerosol can as possible. U.S. EPA should clarify this point. \n3 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nAlso, this rulemaking is a perfect opportunity for U.S. EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a \"RCRA empty\" container. Such a provision will reduce regulatory burden and \nprovide clarity to generators and inspectors \nas to the regulatory status of a punctured and drained \naerosol can. \nCurrently , the management of aerosol cans is quite confusing for generators and inspectors . To \nproperly manage an aerosol can, a person needs to know: 1) the contents of the can and whether \nthe contents is a listed or characteristic hazardous waste; 2) whether there is \"significant\" liquids \nremaining in the can (which is a very subjective determination) ; 3) will the metal can be recycled; \n4) will the contents of the can be recycled and 5) how will be the contents of the can be recycled \nor treated. To further confuse the situation, \nif the can held a P-listed substance , then \nthe can, \nunder current rules, is not empty until it is triple rinsed which may only be accomplished by cutting \nthe can open and rinsing it. Hence, determining the proper waste classificat ion of an aerosol can \nand its contents is involved, complicated and confusing . \nPerhaps, a provision can be added to 40 CFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when \nit has been punctured and drained. Such a provision will help reduce the regulatory burden \nassociated with the management of aerosol cans; in addition to, classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste. This provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed hazardous \nwastes. Suggested rule language to add to 40 CFR 261.7 is provided below. \nA container that is an aerosol container as defined in 40 CFR 273.09 that has held acute, \nlisted or characteristic hazardous waste is empty when the container has been punctured \nand drained. \n8. Page 11660,40 CFR 260.10,40 CFR 273.6(b)(3)- Point of generation \nBy \ndeclaring the punctured can a new point of waste generation thus requiring the container to \nbe evaluated to determine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container \nitself is a hazardous waste negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans \nas a universal waste and needlessly makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement . \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated . \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nif they want and send \nthem to another handler or destination facility. In Ohio, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash for metal recovery. \nU.S. EPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \"intact\" from the definition of aerosol can so that the \ndefinition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or U.S. EPA can include the term \"punctured \naerosol cans\" \nin the definition. \n4 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-201 7-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nThe liquid contents \nremoved from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents. The container \ncontents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste. \n9. 40 CFR 273.13 and 273.33-Specifically designed puncturing device \nOhio EPA suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans. \nDuring Ohio EPA's public comment period we were informed that industries often need to design \nequipment or alter existing equipment to meet design specifications of their processes . Ohio EPA \naddressed this issue in its final rule; the rule language is provided below. \n\" ... a handler of universal waste shall use commercially available equipment , or \nequipment specifically custom designed or retrofitted according to accepted engineering \npractices based on established codes, standards , published technical reports, or similar \npeer reviewed documents , to puncture or crush and empty aerosol containers within an \nenclosed compartment. \" \n10. Satellite Accumulation area for aerosol containers \nOhio EPA suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can satellite accumulat ion areas \nbe added to the rule. Ohio added such a provision to reduce the burden associated with tracking \nthe universal waste storage time limit for large facilities that have multiple area areas where \naerosol cans are generated. In addition, the provision also accommodates large facilities that \nhave specific waste pickup schedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked \nup on an assigned day throughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area. \nOhio EPA's satellite provision allows the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work \narea where aerosol cans are initially generated and collected. The collection container shall not \nhave a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved the \nuniversal waste storage area. Once in the storage are, the one-year storage time limit begins for \nthe aerosol cans. This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection . Below is Ohio EPA's definition of \"universal waste \nsatellite accumulation area\": \n\"Universal waste satellite accumulation area\" \nmeans a designated container or other unit \nwith a capacity not to exceed fifty-five gallons or a designated cabinet where universal \nwaste aerosol containers \nare initially collected in the work area prior to being moved to the \nspecified accumulation area for storage, puncturing , or preparation of the universal waste \naerosol containers for shipment to another universal waste handler or destination facility. \n5 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n11. Allow the puncturing and crushing of aerosol containers . \nA number of aerosol can units crush the aerosol container after the container has been punctured . \nThe preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal waste rules. \nCrushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the aerosol cans in \naddition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or destination facility since \none 55-gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four drums of crushed cans. \n12. Page 11662-Limit puncturing of aerosol cans to entities that do not charge for the \nservice \nOhio EPA supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service. Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their facility and puncture and drain the cans on the \nhandler's site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper shredding \nservices work. \nIn addition, many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial waste company to \noversee and operate household haz\nardous waste collection centers. Since the operator is paid \nto oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste handler of aerosol \ncans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and industrial facilities. Thereby resulting in \na missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services where aerosol cans may be \nproperly managed , treated, recycled or disposed. \n13. Puncturing of aerosol containers should not be limited to only those cans that will \nbe recycled. \nOhio EPA encourages U.S. EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans \nregardless whether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not. The cost of treating a drum of \naerosol cans by incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids \nby energy recovery. This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly \ndispose of the undrained cans in the normal trash. Therefore , allowing the puncturing of cans \neven though the can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection , proper manage and \nrecycling of the can contents. \nIn addition, U.S. EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order to allow \na handler to puncture aerosol cans. Under the universal waste rules, U.S. EPA or a State has \nthe ability to adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to \nfurther encourage the proper management , treatment and disposal of the waste. \n14. 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv)- Provision should be removed \n6 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nParagraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) \nthrough 273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant. The intent of the rules can be \nclarified by deleting paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) . \nParagraph (e)(3)(iv) requires that the contents of the aerosol cans be contained in a container or \ntank that meets the hazardous waste generator requirement regardless whether the waste is \nhazardous or not. However, paragraph (e)(3)(vii) contradicts paragraph (e)(3)(iv) by stating that \nif the contents of the aerosol can are nonhazardous , the handler may manage the waste in any \nmanner that is in compliance with applicable rules. \n15. Applicability of AABBCC air emissions to aerosol can puncturing and draining \noperation \nOhio EPA suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, U.S.EPA provide a clarification that the \nAABBCC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol cans. \nOhio EPA understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is also a large \nquantity generator of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements for \nvolatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers but not including satellite \naccumulations units. However\n, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40 \nCFR part 262 through 40 CFR part 270 of this chapter except as specified 40 CFR part 273. \nTherefore , since the puncturing of aerosol cans is an activity allowed under the universal waste \nrules, air emissions generated from the puncturing unit are not regulated under the hazardous \nwaste program. Air emission requirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable . \n7 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nOhio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33(0) \n* * * \n(D) Universal waste aerosol containers .

General Comment \nOhio EPA adopted state-specific universal waste rules in December 2017 classifying non-empty \naerosol containers as a universal waste. A copy of Ohio's universal waste aerosol container rules \nfor large quantity handlers is attached for your review and consideration in developing U.S. EPA's \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol cans, Ohio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33 (D). \n2. 40 CFR 260.10-Definition of Aerosol Can \nOhio EPA suggests that the term \"can\" be replaced with the term \"container \" to make it clear that \nproducts packaged in plastic aerosol containers are eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nThe term \"can\" strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the applicability of the \ndefinition and excludes plastic containers from \nbeing eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nPlastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently aren't as prevalent in \nthe marketplace as metal aerosol containers .

Ohio EPA suggests the following definition : \n\"Aerosol container\" means a non-opening , non-refillable container that holds a substance \nunder pressure and that can release the substance as a spray, gel, or foam by means of \na propellant gas. \n3. 40 CFR 273.4 (b)(4)-Leaking or damaged aerosol cans \nU.S. EPA proposes to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from being classified and \nmanaged as universal wastes. Ohio EPA does not support this proposal. Ohio EPA supports \nthat leaking or damaged aerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal \nwastes. \nExcluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste program complicates \nimplementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the rule less \nunderstandable . Also, the exclusion of leaking/damaged cans it offers minimal additiona l \nenvironmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules. The universal \nwaste rules are consistent to the hazardous waste generator rules in that a handler is required to: \n\u2022 use an appropriate, structurally sound and compatible container ; \n1 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No. \n-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\u2022 label the container regarding its contents; \n\u2022 limit storage time of aerosol cans to one year; \n\u2022 transport the cans according to U.S. DOT's applicable transportation rules; \n\u2022 Maintain a spill cleanup procedure and equipment ; and \n\u2022 train personnel regarding the proper procedure to handle, puncture and drain aerosol \ncans, and respond to releases. \nFurther, under Ohio EPA's universal waste program, both leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nand punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal waste. Ohio EPA \nspecifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol container in its recently adopted \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nto be overpacked with absorbent or immediately punctured to remove the contents of the \ncontainer . Ohio EPA believes that allowing leaking, damaged and punctured aerosol containers \nto remain eligible to be \nmanaged as universal wastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal \nof the waste and provides for an easily understood regulatory system for aerosol containers . \nOhio EPA's universal waste, Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 3745-273-13 and 3745-273-\n33 state: \n\"A large quantity handler of universal waste shall immediately empty a leaking aerosol \ncontainer of the container 's contents in accordance with paragraph (E) (4) of this rule or \nshall individually overpack the leaking aerosol container in a container having enough \nabsorbent material to absorb the leaking contents of the aerosol container .\" \n4. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(1)-Grammar check \nPlease check grammar\n; change second use of the term \"cans\" to \"can.\" \n5. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2)-Aerosol cans are not categorically reactive hazardous wastes \nOhio EPA suggests that \nU.S. EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clear \nto the regulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes. Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated resulting in the release of the contents from the can that the aerosol \ncan is a reactive hazardous waste. However, such an occurrence does not meet the definition of \na reactive hazardous waste. Any material in a sealed container , be it a container of milk or a \ndrum of waste, will burst if overheated . U.S. EPA provides a good explanation of this physical \nphenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably in the rule, \nthat aerosol cans are \nnot reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the container actually \nmeets the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23. \nOhio EPA addressed the issue of reactivity in OAC rule 3745-273-89 as follows: \n2 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\"Aerosol containers that are not a hazardous waste. An aerosol container is a hazardous \nwaste if the contents of the container exhibit one or more of the characteristics identified \nin rules 3745-51-20 to 3745-51-24 of the Administrative Code, or if the contents of the \ncontainer are listed in rules 3745-51-30 to 3745-51-35 of the Administrative Code. An \naerosol container is not a reactive hazardous waste unless the contents meet the \ndescription of \"reactivity\" in rule 3745-51-23 of the Administrative Code.\" \nIn addition, the definition of reactivity states \"a waste exhibits the characteristic or reactivity ... if it \nis capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if \nheated under confinement. \" Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382. It is important to note that \ndetonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions. An explosive reaction is a chemical \nreaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a substance occurs thereby releasing hot \ngases which exert great pressure on the surroundings. Detonation is also an explosive reaction \nin which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the speed of sound. An \noverheated container that bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is physical phenomenon where the \nstructural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure exerted by the heated \ncontents in the container. \nFurther, the definition of reactivity was \"intended to identify wastes, that because of their extreme \ninstability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of the waste \nmanagement process, 45 FR 33109. It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this type of \nhazard. A potential hazard an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content is released \n(even during normal use) and an ignition source is present. \n6. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2) \nPlease check this rule for clarity. It appears that the words \"contents of the\" should appear before \n\"aerosol can\" otherwise , only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine if it is a \ncharacteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can. \n7. Page 11660-Empty container \nU.S. EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal. This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement. Yes, a container that meets the definition of empty is not \nsubject to the hazardous waste regulations . What is misleading about the statement is that the \naerosol can must be RCRA empty, per40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal. \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6. Scrap metal is a \"recyclable material\" and \n\"recyclable material\" is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled. Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P-listed waste) to be \nclassified and recycled as scrap metal. However, it is a good management practice to remove as \nmuch of the waste from the aerosol can as possible. U.S. EPA should clarify this point. \n3 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nAlso, this rulemaking is a perfect opportunity for U.S. EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a \"RCRA empty\" container. Such a provision will reduce regulatory burden and \nprovide clarity to generators and inspectors \nas to the regulatory status of a punctured and drained \naerosol can. \nCurrently , the management of aerosol cans is quite confusing for generators and inspectors . To \nproperly manage an aerosol can, a person needs to know: 1) the contents of the can and whether \nthe contents is a listed or characteristic hazardous waste; 2) whether there is \"significant\" liquids \nremaining in the can (which is a very subjective determination) ; 3) will the metal can be recycled; \n4) will the contents of the can be recycled and 5) how will be the contents of the can be recycled \nor treated. To further confuse the situation, \nif the can held a P-listed substance , then \nthe can, \nunder current rules, is not empty until it is triple rinsed which may only be accomplished by cutting \nthe can open and rinsing it. Hence, determining the proper waste classificat ion of an aerosol can \nand its contents is involved, complicated and confusing . \nPerhaps, a provision can be added to 40 CFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when \nit has been punctured and drained. Such a provision will help reduce the regulatory burden \nassociated with the management of aerosol cans; in addition to, classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste. This provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed hazardous \nwastes. Suggested rule language to add to 40 CFR 261.7 is provided below. \nA container that is an aerosol container as defined in 40 CFR 273.09 that has held acute, \nlisted or characteristic hazardous waste is empty when the container has been punctured \nand drained. \n8. Page 11660,40 CFR 260.10,40 CFR 273.6(b)(3)- Point of generation \nBy \ndeclaring the punctured can a new point of waste generation thus requiring the container to \nbe evaluated to determine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container \nitself is a hazardous waste negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans \nas a universal waste and needlessly makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement . \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated . \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nif they want and send \nthem to another handler or destination facility. In Ohio, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash for metal recovery. \nU.S. EPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \"intact\" from the definition of aerosol can so that the \ndefinition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or U.S. EPA can include the term \"punctured \naerosol cans\" \nin the definition. \n4 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-201 7-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nThe liquid contents \nremoved from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents. The container \ncontents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste. \n9. 40 CFR 273.13 and 273.33-Specifically designed puncturing device \nOhio EPA suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans. \nDuring Ohio EPA's public comment period we were informed that industries often need to design \nequipment or alter existing equipment to meet design specifications of their processes . Ohio EPA \naddressed this issue in its final rule; the rule language is provided below. \n\" ... a handler of universal waste shall use commercially available equipment , or \nequipment specifically custom designed or retrofitted according to accepted engineering \npractices based on established codes, standards , published technical reports, or similar \npeer reviewed documents , to puncture or crush and empty aerosol containers within an \nenclosed compartment. \" \n10. Satellite Accumulation area for aerosol containers \nOhio EPA suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can satellite accumulat ion areas \nbe added to the rule. Ohio added such a provision to reduce the burden associated with tracking \nthe universal waste storage time limit for large facilities that have multiple area areas where \naerosol cans are generated. In addition, the provision also accommodates large facilities that \nhave specific waste pickup schedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked \nup on an assigned day throughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area. \nOhio EPA's satellite provision allows the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work \narea where aerosol cans are initially generated and collected. The collection container shall not \nhave a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved the \nuniversal waste storage area. Once in the storage are, the one-year storage time limit begins for \nthe aerosol cans. This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection . Below is Ohio EPA's definition of \"universal waste \nsatellite accumulation area\": \n\"Universal waste satellite accumulation area\" \nmeans a designated container or other unit \nwith a capacity not to exceed fifty-five gallons or a designated cabinet where universal \nwaste aerosol containers \nare initially collected in the work area prior to being moved to the \nspecified accumulation area for storage, puncturing , or preparation of the universal waste \naerosol containers for shipment to another universal waste handler or destination facility. \n5 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n11. Allow the puncturing and crushing of aerosol containers . \nA number of aerosol can units crush the aerosol container after the container has been punctured . \nThe preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal waste rules. \nCrushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the aerosol cans in \naddition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or destination facility since \none 55-gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four drums of crushed cans. \n12. Page 11662-Limit puncturing of aerosol cans to entities that do not charge for the \nservice \nOhio EPA supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service. Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their facility and puncture and drain the cans on the \nhandler's site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper shredding \nservices work. \nIn addition, many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial waste company to \noversee and operate household haz\nardous waste collection centers. Since the operator is paid \nto oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste handler of aerosol \ncans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and industrial facilities. Thereby resulting in \na missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services where aerosol cans may be \nproperly managed , treated, recycled or disposed. \n13. Puncturing of aerosol containers should not be limited to only those cans that will \nbe recycled. \nOhio EPA encourages U.S. EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans \nregardless whether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not. The cost of treating a drum of \naerosol cans by incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids \nby energy recovery. This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly \ndispose of the undrained cans in the normal trash. Therefore , allowing the puncturing of cans \neven though the can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection , proper manage and \nrecycling of the can contents. \nIn addition, U.S. EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order to allow \na handler to puncture aerosol cans. Under the universal waste rules, U.S. EPA or a State has \nthe ability to adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to \nfurther encourage the proper management , treatment and disposal of the waste. \n14. 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv)- Provision should be removed \n6 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nParagraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) \nthrough 273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant. The intent of the rules can be \nclarified by deleting paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) . \nParagraph (e)(3)(iv) requires that the contents of the aerosol cans be contained in a container or \ntank that meets the hazardous waste generator requirement regardless whether the waste is \nhazardous or not. However, paragraph (e)(3)(vii) contradicts paragraph (e)(3)(iv) by stating that \nif the contents of the aerosol can are nonhazardous , the handler may manage the waste in any \nmanner that is in compliance with applicable rules. \n15. Applicability of AABBCC air emissions to aerosol can puncturing and draining \noperation \nOhio EPA suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, U.S.EPA provide a clarification that the \nAABBCC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol cans. \nOhio EPA understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is also a large \nquantity generator of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements for \nvolatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers but not including satellite \naccumulations units. However\n, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40 \nCFR part 262 through 40 CFR part 270 of this chapter except as specified 40 CFR part 273. \nTherefore , since the puncturing of aerosol cans is an activity allowed under the universal waste \nrules, air emissions generated from the puncturing unit are not regulated under the hazardous \nwaste program. Air emission requirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable . \n7 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nOhio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33(0) \n* * * \n(D) Universal waste aerosol containers .

General Comment \nOhio EPA adopted state-specific universal waste rules in December 2017 classifying non-empty \naerosol containers as a universal waste. A copy of Ohio's universal waste aerosol container rules \nfor large quantity handlers is attached for your review and consideration in developing U.S. EPA's \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol cans, Ohio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33 (D). \n2. 40 CFR 260.10-Definition of Aerosol Can \nOhio EPA suggests that the term \"can\" be replaced with the term \"container \" to make it clear that \nproducts packaged in plastic aerosol containers are eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nThe term \"can\" strongly implies a metal container and therefore narrows the applicability of the \ndefinition and excludes plastic containers from \nbeing eligible to be managed as a universal waste. \nPlastic aerosol containers are a rather new type of container and currently aren't as prevalent in \nthe marketplace as metal aerosol containers . Plastic aerosol container can be used to package: \n\u2022 Personal care -shaving gels & foams, hair care, body moisturizers \n\u2022 Home care -air fresheners , cleaning applications , insecticides \n\u2022 Food -oils, cooking mists, creams and sauces \n\u2022 Industrial applications \nIn addition, the definition of aerosol can needs to be clarified to exclude compressed gas cylinders \nand to include aerosol gels such as shaving cream. Ohio EPA suggests the following definition : \n\"Aerosol container\" means a non-opening , non-refillable container that holds a substance \nunder pressure and that can release the substance as a spray, gel, or foam by means of \na propellant gas. \n3. 40 CFR 273.4 (b)(4)-Leaking or damaged aerosol cans \nU.S. EPA proposes to exclude leaking or damaged aerosol cans from being classified and \nmanaged as universal wastes. Ohio EPA does not support this proposal. Ohio EPA supports \nthat leaking or damaged aerosol cans be eligible to be classified and managed as universal \nwastes. \nExcluding damaged or leaking aerosol cans from the universal waste program complicates \nimplementation of the universal waste rule for the handler and makes the rule less \nunderstandable . Also, the exclusion of leaking/damaged cans it offers minimal additiona l \nenvironmental protection since the universal waste rules offer consistent and comparable \nenvironmental protection as compared to the hazardous waste generator rules. The universal \nwaste rules are consistent to the hazardous waste generator rules in that a handler is required to: \n\u2022 use an appropriate, structurally sound and compatible container ; \n1 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No. \n-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\u2022 label the container regarding its contents; \n\u2022 limit storage time of aerosol cans to one year; \n\u2022 transport the cans according to U.S. DOT's applicable transportation rules; \n\u2022 Maintain a spill cleanup procedure and equipment ; and \n\u2022 train personnel regarding the proper procedure to handle, puncture and drain aerosol \ncans, and respond to releases. \nFurther, under Ohio EPA's universal waste program, both leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nand punctured aerosol containers are still eligible to be managed as a universal waste. Ohio EPA \nspecifically addressed the issue of a leaking or damaged aerosol container in its recently adopted \nuniversal waste rules for aerosol containers by requiring leaking or damaged aerosol containers \nto be overpacked with absorbent or immediately punctured to remove the contents of the \ncontainer . Ohio EPA believes that allowing leaking, damaged and punctured aerosol containers \nto remain eligible to be \nmanaged as universal wastes promotes the proper treatment and disposal \nof the waste and provides for an easily understood regulatory system for aerosol containers . \nOhio EPA's universal waste, Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 3745-273-13 and 3745-273-\n33 state: \n\"A large quantity handler of universal waste shall immediately empty a leaking aerosol \ncontainer of the container 's contents in accordance with paragraph (E) (4) of this rule or \nshall individually overpack the leaking aerosol container in a container having enough \nabsorbent material to absorb the leaking contents of the aerosol container .\" \n4. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(1)-Grammar check \nPlease check grammar\n; change second use of the term \"cans\" to \"can.\" \n5. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2)-Aerosol cans are not categorically reactive hazardous wastes \nOhio EPA suggests that \nU.S. EPA add a phrase or a comment to this provision to make it clear \nto the regulated community that aerosol cans are not categorically defined as reactive hazardous \nwastes. Some regulators and stakeholders have a misconception that because an aerosol can \nmay burst when overheated resulting in the release of the contents from the can that the aerosol \ncan is a reactive hazardous waste. However, such an occurrence does not meet the definition of \na reactive hazardous waste. Any material in a sealed container , be it a container of milk or a \ndrum of waste, will burst if overheated . U.S. EPA provides a good explanation of this physical \nphenomenon in the preamble but needs to go further and specifically state, preferably in the rule, \nthat aerosol cans are \nnot reactive hazardous waste unless the contents of the container actually \nmeets the definition of reactivity in 40 CFR 261.23. \nOhio EPA addressed the issue of reactivity in OAC rule 3745-273-89 as follows: \n2 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n\"Aerosol containers that are not a hazardous waste. An aerosol container is a hazardous \nwaste if the contents of the container exhibit one or more of the characteristics identified \nin rules 3745-51-20 to 3745-51-24 of the Administrative Code, or if the contents of the \ncontainer are listed in rules 3745-51-30 to 3745-51-35 of the Administrative Code. An \naerosol container is not a reactive hazardous waste unless the contents meet the \ndescription of \"reactivity\" in rule 3745-51-23 of the Administrative Code.\" \nIn addition, the definition of reactivity states \"a waste exhibits the characteristic or reactivity ... if it \nis capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if \nheated under confinement. \" Detonation is defined in 40 CFR 265.382. It is important to note that \ndetonation and explosive reactions are chemical reactions. An explosive reaction is a chemical \nreaction in which extremely rapid decomposition of a substance occurs thereby releasing hot \ngases which exert great pressure on the surroundings. Detonation is also an explosive reaction \nin which chemical transformation passes through the material faster than the speed of sound. An \noverheated container that bursts is not a chemical reaction; it is physical phenomenon where the \nstructural limits of the container have been exceeded by the pressure exerted by the heated \ncontents in the container. \nFurther, the definition of reactivity was \"intended to identify wastes, that because of their extreme \ninstability and tendency to react violently or explode, pose a problem at all stages of the waste \nmanagement process, 45 FR 33109. It is evident that aerosol cans do not pose this type of \nhazard. A potential hazard an aerosol container can pose is when its ignitable content is released \n(even during normal use) and an ignition source is present. \n6. 40 CFR 273.6 (b)(2) \nPlease check this rule for clarity. It appears that the words \"contents of the\" should appear before \n\"aerosol can\" otherwise , only the metal can is subject to evaluation to determine if it is a \ncharacteristic hazardous waste and not the contents of the can. \n7. Page 11660-Empty container \nU.S. EPA states that aerosol containers that meet the definition of empty in 40 CFR 261.7 are not \nsubject to hazardous waste regulation and may be recycled as scrap metal. This is a misleading \nand not entirely correct statement. Yes, a container that meets the definition of empty is not \nsubject to the hazardous waste regulations . What is misleading about the statement is that the \naerosol can must be RCRA empty, per40 261.7, to be classified as scrap metal. \nThe scrap metal exclusion is found in 40 CFR 261.6. Scrap metal is a \"recyclable material\" and \n\"recyclable material\" is defined as a hazardous waste that will be recycled. Therefore, an aerosol \ncontainer does not need to completely empty or triple rinsed (if it held a P-listed waste) to be \nclassified and recycled as scrap metal. However, it is a good management practice to remove as \nmuch of the waste from the aerosol can as possible. U.S. EPA should clarify this point. \n3 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017 -0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nAlso, this rulemaking is a perfect opportunity for U.S. EPA to define that a punctured and drained \naerosol can is a \"RCRA empty\" container. Such a provision will reduce regulatory burden and \nprovide clarity to generators and inspectors \nas to the regulatory status of a punctured and drained \naerosol can. \nCurrently , the management of aerosol cans is quite confusing for generators and inspectors . To \nproperly manage an aerosol can, a person needs to know: 1) the contents of the can and whether \nthe contents is a listed or characteristic hazardous waste; 2) whether there is \"significant\" liquids \nremaining in the can (which is a very subjective determination) ; 3) will the metal can be recycled; \n4) will the contents of the can be recycled and 5) how will be the contents of the can be recycled \nor treated. To further confuse the situation, \nif the can held a P-listed substance , then \nthe can, \nunder current rules, is not empty until it is triple rinsed which may only be accomplished by cutting \nthe can open and rinsing it. Hence, determining the proper waste classificat ion of an aerosol can \nand its contents is involved, complicated and confusing . \nPerhaps, a provision can be added to 40 CFR 261.7 that states that an aerosol can is empty when \nit has been punctured and drained. Such a provision will help reduce the regulatory burden \nassociated with the management of aerosol cans; in addition to, classifying aerosol cans as a \nuniversal waste. This provision should apply to cans that hold characteristic or listed hazardous \nwastes. Suggested rule language to add to 40 CFR 261.7 is provided below. \nA container that is an aerosol container as defined in 40 CFR 273.09 that has held acute, \nlisted or characteristic hazardous waste is empty when the container has been punctured \nand drained. \n8. Page 11660,40 CFR 260.10,40 CFR 273.6(b)(3)- Point of generation \nBy \ndeclaring the punctured can a new point of waste generation thus requiring the container to \nbe evaluated to determine whether it still contains a hazardous waste or whether the container \nitself is a hazardous waste negates the regulatory streamlining offered by classifying aerosol cans \nas a universal waste and needlessly makes the rule complicated and confusing to implement . \nFurther, no additional environmental protection is realized or gained by imposing that each \nemptied aerosol can be evaluated . \nHandlers should be able to continue to classify their punctured aerosol cans as a universal waste \nif they want and send \nthem to another handler or destination facility. In Ohio, there is a \ncommercial incinerator that treats aerosol cans, in addition to other wastes such as drummed \nwaste, and reclaims the metal from the ash for metal recovery. \nU.S. EPA can restore the regulatory flexibility and burden reduction component of the universal \nwaste aerosol can rule by removing the term \"intact\" from the definition of aerosol can so that the \ndefinition will be inclusive of punctured aerosol cans or U.S. EPA can include the term \"punctured \naerosol cans\" \nin the definition. \n4 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-201 7-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nThe liquid contents \nremoved from the aerosol container is a new point of waste generation \nbecause the definition of aerosol container no longer applies to the liquid contents. The container \ncontents need to be evaluated to determine if it is a hazardous waste. \n9. 40 CFR 273.13 and 273.33-Specifically designed puncturing device \nOhio EPA suggests that the type of device used to puncture aerosol cans be revised to also allow \nthe use of puncturing devices that are custom designed or retrofitted to puncture aerosol cans. \nDuring Ohio EPA's public comment period we were informed that industries often need to design \nequipment or alter existing equipment to meet design specifications of their processes . Ohio EPA \naddressed this issue in its final rule; the rule language is provided below. \n\" ... a handler of universal waste shall use commercially available equipment , or \nequipment specifically custom designed or retrofitted according to accepted engineering \npractices based on established codes, standards , published technical reports, or similar \npeer reviewed documents , to puncture or crush and empty aerosol containers within an \nenclosed compartment. \" \n10. Satellite Accumulation area for aerosol containers \nOhio EPA suggests that a provision to allow the use of aerosol can satellite accumulat ion areas \nbe added to the rule. Ohio added such a provision to reduce the burden associated with tracking \nthe universal waste storage time limit for large facilities that have multiple area areas where \naerosol cans are generated. In addition, the provision also accommodates large facilities that \nhave specific waste pickup schedules within their facilities where a certain type of waste is picked \nup on an assigned day throughout the facility and taken to a central waste collection area. \nOhio EPA's satellite provision allows the handler to have satellite accumulation areas in the work \narea where aerosol cans are initially generated and collected. The collection container shall not \nhave a capacity greater than 55 gallons and once the container is full it needs to be moved the \nuniversal waste storage area. Once in the storage are, the one-year storage time limit begins for \nthe aerosol cans. This provision is intended to provide additional streamlining of the tracking \nrequirements with no reduced protection . Below is Ohio EPA's definition of \"universal waste \nsatellite accumulation area\": \n\"Universal waste satellite accumulation area\" \nmeans a designated container or other unit \nwith a capacity not to exceed fifty-five gallons or a designated cabinet where universal \nwaste aerosol containers \nare initially collected in the work area prior to being moved to the \nspecified accumulation area for storage, puncturing , or preparation of the universal waste \naerosol containers for shipment to another universal waste handler or destination facility. \n5 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM -2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \n11. Allow the puncturing and crushing of aerosol containers . \nA number of aerosol can units crush the aerosol container after the container has been punctured . \nThe preamble or rule should clarify that this activity is allowed under the universal waste rules. \nCrushing of aerosol cans provides for efficient and consolidated storage of the aerosol cans in \naddition to reducing the cost of transportation of the cans to a handler or destination facility since \none 55-gallon drum of crushed cans would be approximately four drums of crushed cans. \n12. Page 11662-Limit puncturing of aerosol cans to entities that do not charge for the \nservice \nOhio EPA supports the puncturing of aerosol cans by any universal handler of aerosol cans even \nif the handler charges for the service. Generators who produce many aerosol cans should have \nthe option to hire a mobile service to come to their facility and puncture and drain the cans on the \nhandler's site. This operation would be similar to the manner in which mobile paper shredding \nservices work. \nIn addition, many municipal solid waste districts often hire a commercial waste company to \noversee and operate household haz\nardous waste collection centers. Since the operator is paid \nto oversee the facility, these centers could not operate as a universal waste handler of aerosol \ncans and accept and puncture cans from commercial and industrial facilities. Thereby resulting in \na missed opportunity to provide increased accessibility to services where aerosol cans may be \nproperly managed , treated, recycled or disposed. \n13. Puncturing of aerosol containers should not be limited to only those cans that will \nbe recycled. \nOhio EPA encourages U.S. EPA to allow the puncturing of universal waste aerosol cans \nregardless whether the cans are sent for metal recovery or not. The cost of treating a drum of \naerosol cans by incineration is estimated to be three times the cost of treating combustible liquids \nby energy recovery. This cost differential may prompt generators of aerosol cans to improperly \ndispose of the undrained cans in the normal trash. Therefore , allowing the puncturing of cans \neven though the can may not be reclaimed will encourage the collection , proper manage and \nrecycling of the can contents. \nIn addition, U.S. EPA does not need to require that the metal can be reclaimed in order to allow \na handler to puncture aerosol cans. Under the universal waste rules, U.S. EPA or a State has \nthe ability to adopt provisions to allow certain waste treatment or recycling activities in order to \nfurther encourage the proper management , treatment and disposal of the waste. \n14. 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv)- Provision should be removed \n6 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nParagraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) through 273.13(e)(3)(vii) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) \nthrough 273.33(e)(3)(vii) are confusing and somewhat redundant. The intent of the rules can be \nclarified by deleting paragraphs 40 CFR 273.13(e)(3)(iv) and 40 CFR 273.33(e)(3)(iv) . \nParagraph (e)(3)(iv) requires that the contents of the aerosol cans be contained in a container or \ntank that meets the hazardous waste generator requirement regardless whether the waste is \nhazardous or not. However, paragraph (e)(3)(vii) contradicts paragraph (e)(3)(iv) by stating that \nif the contents of the aerosol can are nonhazardous , the handler may manage the waste in any \nmanner that is in compliance with applicable rules. \n15. Applicability of AABBCC air emissions to aerosol can puncturing and draining \noperation \nOhio EPA suggests that, in the preamble to the final rule, U.S.EPA provide a clarification that the \nAABBCC air emission requirements do not apply to units used to puncture and drain aerosol cans. \nOhio EPA understands that a universal waste aerosol can puncturing facility that is also a large \nquantity generator of hazardous waste is subject to the AABBCC air emissions requirements for \nvolatile organic hazardous wastes stored in tanks and containers but not including satellite \naccumulations units. However\n, 40 CFR 261.9 exempts aerosol cans from regulation under 40 \nCFR part 262 through 40 CFR part 270 of this chapter except as specified 40 CFR part 273. \nTherefore , since the puncturing of aerosol cans is an activity allowed under the universal waste \nrules, air emissions generated from the puncturing unit are not regulated under the hazardous \nwaste program. Air emission requirements imposed under the Clean Air Act would be applicable . \n7 \nOhio EPA Comments \nAdding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations \nDocket No.-EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463 \nMay 15, 2018 \nOhio Administrative Code rule 3745-273-33(0) \n* * * \n(D) Universal waste aerosol containers .

EPA states that it is proposing  this action pursuant to its authority under \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) and RCRA ame ndments2 in order to increase recycling \nand reduce disposal of aerosol can wastes, while also \u201cproviding a clear, practical system for \nhandling discarded aerosol cans.\u201d3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1 The American Chemistry Council (ACC) represents the leading companies engaged in the business of chemistry. \nACC members apply the science of chemistry to make innovative products and services that make people's lives \nbetter, healthier a nd safer. ACC is committed to improved environmental, health and safety performance through \nResponsible Care\u00ae, common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues, and health and \nenvironmental research and product testing. The business of chemistry is a $797 billion enterprise and a key element \nof the nation's economy. It is the nation\u2019s largest exporter, accounting for fourteen percent of all U.S. exports. \nChemistry companies are among the largest investors in research and development. Saf ety and security have always \nbeen primary concerns of ACC members, and they have intensified their efforts, working closely with government \nagencies to improve security and to defend against any threat to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.  \n2 EPA specifi cally recognizes its authority under \u201csections 2002(a), 3001, 3002, 3004, and 3006 of the Solid Waste \nDisposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and as amended by the \nHazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), 42 U.S.C . 6921(a), 6921, 6922, 6924, and 6926.\u201d  \n3 83 Fed. Reg. 11655.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n2 \n  \nI. Overview  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the un iversal waste program, as \nthis would provide generators increased flexibility and encourage the continued responsible \nmanagement of discarded aerosol cans, as well as reduce reliance on disposal in landfills and \ncombustors. ACC agrees that  aerosol cans ful fill the criteria identified by EPA upon establishing \nthe universal waste program, and  that adding these wastes to the program will help EPA achieve \nits stated goals : 1) encourage resource conservation while ensuring adequate protection of h uman \nhealth and the environment,  2) improve implementation of the current Subtitle C haza rdous \nwaste regulatory program, and 3) provide incentives that result in less of these wastes disposed in \nmunicipal landfills or combustors.  \n \nACC has advocated4 that EPA add aerosol cans  to the RCRA universal waste program because \nthe program is a proven method of streamlining federal and state regulatory waste management \nfor cer tain kinds of commonly generated qualifying waste and  reduc ing recordkeeping and \nnotification requiremen ts.  ACC also supports the Agency\u2019s decision not to impose size \nlimitations on aerosol cans, which if in place would diminish the likelihood that a generator \nwould choose to follow the universal waste management program, as opposed  to simply abiding \nby requirements under the full suite of hazardous waste regulations. By adding aerosol cans to \nthe universal waste program, EPA would reduce the complexity of the waste management \nrequirements for aerosol cans and incentivize recycling p ractices.   \n \nHowever, the Agency\u2019 s proposa l could be improved by addressing the following issues :   \n \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify whether or to what extent aerosol cans exhibit th e reactivity \ncharacteristic.  \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify when an aerosol can is considered empty . \n\uf0b7 EPA should allow aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage to be considered and \nmanaged as universal waste . \n\uf0b7 EPA should adopt a flexible approach to accumulation  of universal waste aerosol cans . \n\uf0b7 EPA should ensure that limitations on puncturing and draini ng are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \n \nII. EPA should clarify o r revise a number of assumptions and positions in the proposal  \n \n \nA. EPA should clarify whether and to what extent aerosol cans exhibit the reactivity \ncharac teristic .  \n \nEPA states in the proposed rule  that aerosol cans that meet the RCRA empty definition may be \nrecycled as scrap metal, and are not subject to hazardous waste regulation  or included in the \n                                                           \n4 ACC comments to the EPA Regulatory Reform Task Force, May 15, 2017, Docket No. EPA -HQ-OA-2017 -0190.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n3 \n universal waste rule.5 According to EPA, a discarded aerosol can may qualify as a universal \nwaste  if the can is not empty and contains a listed or characteristic waste. ACC notes , however, \nthat a 1987 EPA memorandum suggested that \u201caerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but  [that]  \n\u2026 contained propellant \u2026 would be a RCRA hazardous waste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous waste characteristic of reactivity.\u201d6 EPA has also recognized in the  current  proposal \nthat aerosol cans may contain flammable propellants which may result in the aerosol can being \ndesignated as an ignitable waste, and may be \u201chazardous waste for o ther reasons when \ndiscarded.\u201d7 EPA has recognized the importance to stakeholders of clarifying its position on \nwhether \u201caerosol cans are considered reactive hazardous waste.\u201d8 However, EPA has no t \nclarified whether it has made a categorical determinat ion that aerosol cans are  by themselves \nD003 reactive wastes. Such a determination would run counter to  at least one  existing state \nregulatory program,9 and as a c onsequence, if an aerosol can were to be discarded, generators \nwould need to show that the can is empty and that the can itself is not reactive or other \ncharacteristic waste.  EPA notes on page 11656 the following:  \n \n\u201cThe can itself is typically a small steel or aluminum container, designed to be \nhand -held, which is sealed with its contents under  pressure. The can's design is \nintended to prevent unwanted releases of the contents to the environment under \nnormal handling and storage conditions. However, when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting incr ease \nin internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, \nthereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of bursting, the \ncontents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far above \nambient envi ronmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and be \nforcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as \na result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents \nof the can may rea dily catch fire as they are released and exposed to atmospheric \noxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u201cfireball\u201d; (2) the bottom of the can may \ndetach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing the \nupper part of the can to becom e a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it \nbursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal should not leave  open the possibility that all unpunctured  aerosol cans  could be \nconsidered D003 reactive waste, preventing the discard of those cans into, for example, scrap \nmetal hoppers.  Solid waste generators are required by law to make an accurate determination as \nto whether a waste is hazardous waste,10 and the A gency needs to address this issue to facilitate \naccurate waste determinations.  \n \nOhio\u2019s universal waste program , however, recognizes that the contents of the container control \nwhether or not the aerosol can will be considered reactive : \u201c[a]n aerosol container is not a \n                                                           \n5 83 Fed.

Reg. 11656.  \n8 Strategy for Addressing the Retail Sector under RCRA\u2019s Regulatory Framework, September 12, 2016.  \n9 Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rule 3745 -51-23 (A)(6).  \n10 40 CFR \u00a7262.11.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n4 \n reactive hazardous waste unless the contents meet the description o f \"reactivity\" in rule 3745 -51-\n23 of the Administrative Code.\u201d11 Ohio\u2019s guidance adds that \u201c it is not DHWM\u2019s position that \nempty or non -empty aerosol cans categori cally exhibit the reactivity characteristic simply \nbecause they are sealed containers which can burst when heated. \u201d12 The Ohio guidance further \nnotes that any sealed container of liquid contents will burst when sufficiently heated regardless \nof its chemical  composition.13 Reactivity, therefore, is demonstrated by whether the contents are \ncapable of deto nations and explosive reaction s.14 Indeed, \u201cthe potential of a container to rupture \nwhen heated\u201d does not on its own demonstrate th e characteristic of reactivity.15  \n \nEPA should adopt a position consistent with Ohio , to clarify that intact (not punctured and \ndrained) aerosol cans  do not by default exhibit the reactivity characteristic and  may be \nconsidered scrap  metal  or disposed of as  nonhazardous waste  if the contents of the container do \nnot meet the reactivity characteristic .16 Finally, EPA should also clarify that where handlers that \ndo not puncture cans on -site, but collect both empty and non -empty cans, they are authorized to \ncommingle RCRA empty aerosol cans and non -empty aerosol cans in the same container  without \nnegating the containers  status as universal waste.  \n \n \nB. EPA\u2019s final rule should clarify when an aerosol can is consider ed empty  \n \nEPA\u2019s definition of aerosol can is further complicated by a lack of clarity on when an aerosol \ncan is considered  \u201cempty. \u201d ACC suggests that EPA  harmonize this definition with existing state \nprograms  in order to more practically apply the RCRA empty rule to aerosol cans. For example, \nMinnesota guidance currently reco gnizes an aerosol can as \u201cempty\u201d when the can : 1) contains no \ncompressed igni table gas propellant or product;  2) all liquid product that can be dispensed \nthrough the v alve has been; and  3) less than 3% of the product capacity of the container \nremains.17 Minnesota\u2019s guidance also recognizes that documenting tha t an aerosol can meets this \nstandard can be impractical  and therefore  provides that aerosol cans may be assumed empty \nwhen both of the following criteria are satisfied: 1) \u201cno liquid is felt or heard when the can is \nshaken by hand ;\u201d and 2) when \u201cno gas or liquid is released when the spray /discharge  valve is \nactivated  and the container is rotated through all directions, as long as the valve is not observably \nor known to be clogged .\u201d18 Minnesota\u2019s practical  guidance provides clarity o n how to make \n\u201cempty\u201d  determinations for aerosol cans.

EPA\u2019s final rule should allow aerosol cans that show evidenc e of leakage to be \nconsidered and managed as universal waste  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal limits universal waste aerosol cans to only those that are \u201cdiscarded, intact, non -\nempty hazardous waste.\u201d 19 However,  EPA\u2019s current universal waste program for batteries , as \nwell as other state programs , allow for the management of universal wastes that show evidence \nof leakage , spillage, or damage . For example, w hile EPA states that \u201cuniversal waste batteries \nare intended to be intact,\u201d the A gency \u201crecognizes that batteries may become damaged or broken \nduring handling.\u201d20 EPA therefore requires that universal waste handlers contain universal waste \nbatteries in a closed, structurally sound container if the battery shows \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damages that could cause le akage under reasonable foreseeable conditions in a \ncontainer.\u201d21  \n \nEPA should adopt a position consistent with Colorado\u2019s program. While the C olorado program \ndefines batteries as \u201cintact and unbroken, \u201d22 the program does not define aerosol cans in the \nsame manner. Moreover, the Colorado program, similar to EPA\u2019s guidance, simply requires \nhandlers to contain universal waste aerosol cans that show evidence of \u201cleakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions in a separate individual \ncontainer.\u201d23 ACC therefore encourages EPA to finali ze a rule whereby all discarded  aerosol \ncans qualify as universal waste , consistent with the approach the Agency and Colorado have \nalready taken with respect to other universal wastes as well as aerosol cans that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.  \n \n \nD. EPA should adopt  a flexible approach to accumulation  \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should provide for a universal waste satellite accumulation area that allows for \naccumulation in up to a 55 -gallon drum. The one -year accumulation period for universal waste \naerosol cans should then begin when cans are moved from the universal waste satellite \naccumulation area to the primary universal waste accumulation area.  This approach is consistent \nwith guidance under  the Ohio state universal  waste program:  \n \n\u201cA handler of UW may punc ture or crush an aerosol container to remove and \ncollect the contents of the aerosol container rendering the container empty. A \nhandler who generates the UW aerosol containers can collect these containers at a \nuniversal waste satellite accumulation area co nsisting of a container or unit \n                                                           \n19 83 Fed.

The aerosol \ncontainers must be moved to the main UW storage or puncturing area when it is \nfull, where it may be a ccumulated for up to one year. This is th e only type of \nuniversal waste where a satellite accu mulation container may be used.\u201d24 \n \nEPA should not assume  that hazardous waste generators and universal waste handlers will or \ncurrently engage in drastically different puncturing and draining activ ities. While the universal \nwaste program allows for the accumulation of such waste for up to a year, ACC does not expect \nthat this streamlined capability would result in universal waste handlers puncturing and draining \na significantly greater number of aer osol cans at one time than hazardous waste generators. \nHazardous waste generators already process these cans in large batches, and ACC expects those \npractices to continue by universal waste handlers at a similar pace.  \n \n \nIII. EPA should ensure that limitations o n puncturing and draining are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \nEPA has proposed a number of limitations on the puncturing and draining of non-empty aerosol \ncans to be applicable at the federal level. Because the uni versal waste program is generally less \nstringent than the preexisting RCRA hazardous waste rules, states must decide to adopt the \nupdated federal definition of unive rsal waste. ACC recognizes EPA\u2019s effort to strike an \nappropriate balance between existing s tate universal waste program requirements for discarded \nnon-empty aerosol cans and the proposed rule. EPA should finalize a rule that provides for fewer \nlimitations on puncture and draining activities in order to allow states to decide whether to opt in \nand provide additional limitations of their own , if needed .  \n \n \nA. Methods a nd means of puncturing : \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should not include a require ment  that puncturing and draining activities be done \nusing only commercially available devices, as similar restrictions are not used in other state \nregulatory programs.  State regulatory programs such as California  and Ohio  do not impose such \nrequirements. California\u2019s state program, for example, requires that the handler ensures aerosol \ncans are processed using \u201cequipment designed, maintained, and operated so as to prevent f ire, \nexplosion, and the unauthorized release of any universal waste or component of a universal \nwaste to the environment.\u201d25 Moreover, Ohio\u2019s state program requires handlers to \u201cuse \ncommercially available equipment, or equipment specifically custom designed  or retrofitted \naccording to accepted engineering practices based on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.\u201d26 EPA\u2019s fi nal rule should aim to be consistent with \nother state universal waste programs that do not require puncturing and draining activities to be \ndone only using commercially available devices.  \n                                                           \n24 Ohio Specific Universal Waste, Hazardous Waste Program, P. 4, available at  \nhttp://www.epa.ohio.gov/portals/32/pdf/UW%20Ohio%20Specific%2018.pdf .  \n25 CA Health and Safety Code, section 25201.16(h)(2).  \n26 OAC Rule 3745 -273-13(E)(4)(a) and 3745 -273-33(E)(4)(a).  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n7 \n  \n \nB. Post puncture and draining activity  \n \nThe Agency should app ly the recycling unit exemption to the puncturing device, containers \ndirectly connected to the puncturing device, and any filters directly connected to containers \nreceiving the accumulated contents of the aerosol cans.27 EPA already recognizes that puncturi ng \nand draining, \u201cif performed as part of the recycling process, is exempt from RCRA permitting \nrequirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).\u201d28 EPA has proposed to require that universal waste \nhandlers \u201cconduct puncturing and draining activities using a device specif ically designed to \nsafely puncture aerosol cans and contain the residual contents and any e missions thereof.\u201d29 The \nAgency also proposes that universal waste handlers immediately transfer contents of a waste \naerosol can or puncturing device to a conta iner or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \n40 CFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17 , but later requires a hazardous waste determination be \nconducted on the drained  contents per 40 CFR 262.11 to decide whether or not the drained \ncontents are actu ally fully regulated hazardous waste .30 EPA should clarify that disconnect ion or \nremoval of spent filters , accumulation containers , or contents from the recycle unit is view ed as a \nnew point of generation  and thus the point at which  a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR \n262.11 must be made.  The Agency should also take this opportunity to clarify when a spent air \nfilter might be considered fully regulated hazardous waste (e.g. when the recycle unit is used to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans that contained P - or U-listed commercial chemical products) and \nthat spent air filters and  drained aerosol contents are not considered F - or K-listed hazardous \nwastes.  \n \n \nIV. Technical Correction \n \nEPA states that it is making four technical corrections to the universal waste standards for \nmercury-containing equipment.31 ACC believes that the Agency has inadvertently omitted \nreference to satellite a ccumulation requirements now located at 40 CFR 262.15 and the \nconditions for a very small quantity generator at 40 CFR 262.14 as part of its proposed technical \ncorrection. ACC requests that the final rule language be revised to refer to the requirements of 40 \nCFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17, as applicable  for each respective section of 40 CFR \n273.13(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) and 273.33(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).  \n \n \nV. Conclusion  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the universal waste program in \norder to increase recycling and streamline the regulatory framework for aerosol cans. In order to \n                                                           \n27 These are a necessary part of the recycling unit or \u201cdevice designed to saf ely puncture aerosol cans and contain \nthe residual contents and any emissions thereof.\u201d Id.  \n28 83 Fed.

EPA states that it is proposing  this action pursuant to its authority under \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) and RCRA ame ndments2 in order to increase recycling \nand reduce disposal of aerosol can wastes, while also \u201cproviding a clear, practical system for \nhandling discarded aerosol cans.\u201d3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1 The American Chemistry Council (ACC) represents the leading companies engaged in the business of chemistry. \nACC members apply the science of chemistry to make innovative products and services that make people's lives \nbetter, healthier a nd safer. ACC is committed to improved environmental, health and safety performance through \nResponsible Care\u00ae, common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues, and health and \nenvironmental research and product testing. The business of chemistry is a $797 billion enterprise and a key element \nof the nation's economy.

Reg. 11655.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n2 \n  \nI. Overview  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the un iversal waste program, as \nthis would provide generators increased flexibility and encourage the continued responsible \nmanagement of discarded aerosol cans, as well as reduce reliance on disposal in landfills and \ncombustors. ACC agrees that  aerosol cans ful fill the criteria identified by EPA upon establishing \nthe universal waste program, and  that adding these wastes to the program will help EPA achieve \nits stated goals : 1) encourage resource conservation while ensuring adequate protection of h uman \nhealth and the environment,  2) improve implementation of the current Subtitle C haza rdous \nwaste regulatory program, and 3) provide incentives that result in less of these wastes disposed in \nmunicipal landfills or combustors.  \n \nACC has advocated4 that EPA add aerosol cans  to the RCRA universal waste program because \nthe program is a proven method of streamlining federal and state regulatory waste management \nfor cer tain kinds of commonly generated qualifying waste and  reduc ing recordkeeping and \nnotification requiremen ts.  ACC also supports the Agency\u2019s decision not to impose size \nlimitations on aerosol cans, which if in place would diminish the likelihood that a generator \nwould choose to follow the universal waste management program, as opposed  to simply abiding \nby requirements under the full suite of hazardous waste regulations. By adding aerosol cans to \nthe universal waste program, EPA would reduce the complexity of the waste management \nrequirements for aerosol cans and incentivize recycling p ractices.   \n \nHowever, the Agency\u2019 s proposa l could be improved by addressing the following issues :   \n \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify whether or to what extent aerosol cans exhibit th e reactivity \ncharacteristic.  \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify when an aerosol can is considered empty . \n\uf0b7 EPA should allow aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage to be considered and \nmanaged as universal waste . \n\uf0b7 EPA should adopt a flexible approach to accumulation  of universal waste aerosol cans . \n\uf0b7 EPA should ensure that limitations on puncturing and draini ng are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \n \nII. EPA should clarify o r revise a number of assumptions and positions in the proposal  \n \n \nA. EPA should clarify whether and to what extent aerosol cans exhibit the reactivity \ncharac teristic .  \n \nEPA states in the proposed rule  that aerosol cans that meet the RCRA empty definition may be \nrecycled as scrap metal, and are not subject to hazardous waste regulation  or included in the \n                                                           \n4 ACC comments to the EPA Regulatory Reform Task Force, May 15, 2017, Docket No. EPA -HQ-OA-2017 -0190.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n3 \n universal waste rule.5 According to EPA, a discarded aerosol can may qualify as a universal \nwaste  if the can is not empty and contains a listed or characteristic waste. ACC notes , however, \nthat a 1987 EPA memorandum suggested that \u201caerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but  [that]  \n\u2026 contained propellant \u2026 would be a RCRA hazardous waste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous waste characteristic of reactivity.\u201d6 EPA has also recognized in the  current  proposal \nthat aerosol cans may contain flammable propellants which may result in the aerosol can being \ndesignated as an ignitable waste, and may be \u201chazardous waste for o ther reasons when \ndiscarded.\u201d7 EPA has recognized the importance to stakeholders of clarifying its position on \nwhether \u201caerosol cans are considered reactive hazardous waste.\u201d8 However, EPA has no t \nclarified whether it has made a categorical determinat ion that aerosol cans are  by themselves \nD003 reactive wastes. Such a determination would run counter to  at least one  existing state \nregulatory program,9 and as a c onsequence, if an aerosol can were to be discarded, generators \nwould need to show that the can is empty and that the can itself is not reactive or other \ncharacteristic waste.  EPA notes on page 11656 the following:  \n \n\u201cThe can itself is typically a small steel or aluminum container, designed to be \nhand -held, which is sealed with its contents under  pressure. The can's design is \nintended to prevent unwanted releases of the contents to the environment under \nnormal handling and storage conditions. However, when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting incr ease \nin internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, \nthereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of bursting, the \ncontents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far above \nambient envi ronmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and be \nforcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as \na result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents \nof the can may rea dily catch fire as they are released and exposed to atmospheric \noxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u201cfireball\u201d; (2) the bottom of the can may \ndetach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing the \nupper part of the can to becom e a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it \nbursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal should not leave  open the possibility that all unpunctured  aerosol cans  could be \nconsidered D003 reactive waste, preventing the discard of those cans into, for example, scrap \nmetal hoppers.  Solid waste generators are required by law to make an accurate determination as \nto whether a waste is hazardous waste,10 and the A gency needs to address this issue to facilitate \naccurate waste determinations.  \n \nOhio\u2019s universal waste program , however, recognizes that the contents of the container control \nwhether or not the aerosol can will be considered reactive : \u201c[a]n aerosol container is not a \n                                                           \n5 83 Fed.

EPA\u2019s final rule should clarify when an aerosol can is consider ed empty  \n \nEPA\u2019s definition of aerosol can is further complicated by a lack of clarity on when an aerosol \ncan is considered  \u201cempty. \u201d ACC suggests that EPA  harmonize this definition with existing state \nprograms  in order to more practically apply the RCRA empty rule to aerosol cans. For example, \nMinnesota guidance currently reco gnizes an aerosol can as \u201cempty\u201d when the can : 1) contains no \ncompressed igni table gas propellant or product;  2) all liquid product that can be dispensed \nthrough the v alve has been; and  3) less than 3% of the product capacity of the container \nremains.17 Minnesota\u2019s guidance also recognizes that documenting tha t an aerosol can meets this \nstandard can be impractical  and therefore  provides that aerosol cans may be assumed empty \nwhen both of the following criteria are satisfied: 1) \u201cno liquid is felt or heard when the can is \nshaken by hand ;\u201d and 2) when \u201cno gas or liquid is released when the spray /discharge  valve is \nactivated  and the container is rotated through all directions, as long as the valve is not observably \nor known to be clogged .\u201d18 Minnesota\u2019s practical  guidance provides clarity o n how to make \n\u201cempty\u201d  determinations for aerosol cans.

EPA\u2019s final rule should allow aerosol cans that show evidenc e of leakage to be \nconsidered and managed as universal waste  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal limits universal waste aerosol cans to only those that are \u201cdiscarded, intact, non -\nempty hazardous waste.\u201d 19 However,  EPA\u2019s current universal waste program for batteries , as \nwell as other state programs , allow for the management of universal wastes that show evidence \nof leakage , spillage, or damage . For example, w hile EPA states that \u201cuniversal waste batteries \nare intended to be intact,\u201d the A gency \u201crecognizes that batteries may become damaged or broken \nduring handling.\u201d20 EPA therefore requires that universal waste handlers contain universal waste \nbatteries in a closed, structurally sound container if the battery shows \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damages that could cause le akage under reasonable foreseeable conditions in a \ncontainer.\u201d21  \n \nEPA should adopt a position consistent with Colorado\u2019s program. While the C olorado program \ndefines batteries as \u201cintact and unbroken, \u201d22 the program does not define aerosol cans in the \nsame manner. Moreover, the Colorado program, similar to EPA\u2019s guidance, simply requires \nhandlers to contain universal waste aerosol cans that show evidence of \u201cleakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions in a separate individual \ncontainer.\u201d23 ACC therefore encourages EPA to finali ze a rule whereby all discarded  aerosol \ncans qualify as universal waste , consistent with the approach the Agency and Colorado have \nalready taken with respect to other universal wastes as well as aerosol cans that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.  \n \n \nD. EPA should adopt  a flexible approach to accumulation  \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should provide for a universal waste satellite accumulation area that allows for \naccumulation in up to a 55 -gallon drum. The one -year accumulation period for universal waste \naerosol cans should then begin when cans are moved from the universal waste satellite \naccumulation area to the primary universal waste accumulation area.  This approach is consistent \nwith guidance under  the Ohio state universal  waste program:  \n \n\u201cA handler of UW may punc ture or crush an aerosol container to remove and \ncollect the contents of the aerosol container rendering the container empty. A \nhandler who generates the UW aerosol containers can collect these containers at a \nuniversal waste satellite accumulation area co nsisting of a container or unit \n                                                           \n19 83 Fed.

The aerosol \ncontainers must be moved to the main UW storage or puncturing area when it is \nfull, where it may be a ccumulated for up to one year. This is th e only type of \nuniversal waste where a satellite accu mulation container may be used.\u201d24 \n \nEPA should not assume  that hazardous waste generators and universal waste handlers will or \ncurrently engage in drastically different puncturing and draining activ ities. While the universal \nwaste program allows for the accumulation of such waste for up to a year, ACC does not expect \nthat this streamlined capability would result in universal waste handlers puncturing and draining \na significantly greater number of aer osol cans at one time than hazardous waste generators. \nHazardous waste generators already process these cans in large batches, and ACC expects those \npractices to continue by universal waste handlers at a similar pace.  \n \n \nIII. EPA should ensure that limitations o n puncturing and draining are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \nEPA has proposed a number of limitations on the puncturing and draining of non-empty aerosol \ncans to be applicable at the federal level. Because the uni versal waste program is generally less \nstringent than the preexisting RCRA hazardous waste rules, states must decide to adopt the \nupdated federal definition of unive rsal waste. ACC recognizes EPA\u2019s effort to strike an \nappropriate balance between existing s tate universal waste program requirements for discarded \nnon-empty aerosol cans and the proposed rule. EPA should finalize a rule that provides for fewer \nlimitations on puncture and draining activities in order to allow states to decide whether to opt in \nand provide additional limitations of their own , if needed .  \n \n \nA. Methods a nd means of puncturing : \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should not include a require ment  that puncturing and draining activities be done \nusing only commercially available devices, as similar restrictions are not used in other state \nregulatory programs.  State regulatory programs such as California  and Ohio  do not impose such \nrequirements. California\u2019s state program, for example, requires that the handler ensures aerosol \ncans are processed using \u201cequipment designed, maintained, and operated so as to prevent f ire, \nexplosion, and the unauthorized release of any universal waste or component of a universal \nwaste to the environment.\u201d25 Moreover, Ohio\u2019s state program requires handlers to \u201cuse \ncommercially available equipment, or equipment specifically custom designed  or retrofitted \naccording to accepted engineering practices based on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.\u201d26 EPA\u2019s fi nal rule should aim to be consistent with \nother state universal waste programs that do not require puncturing and draining activities to be \ndone only using commercially available devices.  \n                                                           \n24 Ohio Specific Universal Waste, Hazardous Waste Program, P. 4, available at  \nhttp://www.epa.ohio.gov/portals/32/pdf/UW%20Ohio%20Specific%2018.pdf .  \n25 CA Health and Safety Code, section 25201.16(h)(2).  \n26 OAC Rule 3745 -273-13(E)(4)(a) and 3745 -273-33(E)(4)(a).  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n7 \n  \n \nB. Post puncture and draining activity  \n \nThe Agency should app ly the recycling unit exemption to the puncturing device, containers \ndirectly connected to the puncturing device, and any filters directly connected to containers \nreceiving the accumulated contents of the aerosol cans.27 EPA already recognizes that puncturi ng \nand draining, \u201cif performed as part of the recycling process, is exempt from RCRA permitting \nrequirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).\u201d28 EPA has proposed to require that universal waste \nhandlers \u201cconduct puncturing and draining activities using a device specif ically designed to \nsafely puncture aerosol cans and contain the residual contents and any e missions thereof.\u201d29 The \nAgency also proposes that universal waste handlers immediately transfer contents of a waste \naerosol can or puncturing device to a conta iner or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \n40 CFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17 , but later requires a hazardous waste determination be \nconducted on the drained  contents per 40 CFR 262.11 to decide whether or not the drained \ncontents are actu ally fully regulated hazardous waste .30 EPA should clarify that disconnect ion or \nremoval of spent filters , accumulation containers , or contents from the recycle unit is view ed as a \nnew point of generation  and thus the point at which  a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR \n262.11 must be made.  The Agency should also take this opportunity to clarify when a spent air \nfilter might be considered fully regulated hazardous waste (e.g. when the recycle unit is used to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans that contained P - or U-listed commercial chemical products) and \nthat spent air filters and  drained aerosol contents are not considered F - or K-listed hazardous \nwastes.  \n \n \nIV. Technical Correction \n \nEPA states that it is making four technical corrections to the universal waste standards for \nmercury-containing equipment.31 ACC believes that the Agency has inadvertently omitted \nreference to satellite a ccumulation requirements now located at 40 CFR 262.15 and the \nconditions for a very small quantity generator at 40 CFR 262.14 as part of its proposed technical \ncorrection. ACC requests that the final rule language be revised to refer to the requirements of 40 \nCFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17, as applicable  for each respective section of 40 CFR \n273.13(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) and 273.33(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).  \n \n \nV. Conclusion  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the universal waste program in \norder to increase recycling and streamline the regulatory framework for aerosol cans.

EPA states that it is proposing  this action pursuant to its authority under \nthe Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) and RCRA ame ndments2 in order to increase recycling \nand reduce disposal of aerosol can wastes, while also \u201cproviding a clear, practical system for \nhandling discarded aerosol cans.\u201d3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                           \n1 The American Chemistry Council (ACC) represents the leading companies engaged in the business of chemistry. \nACC members apply the science of chemistry to make innovative products and services that make people's lives \nbetter, healthier a nd safer. ACC is committed to improved environmental, health and safety performance through \nResponsible Care\u00ae, common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues, and health and \nenvironmental research and product testing. The business of chemistry is a $797 billion enterprise and a key element \nof the nation's economy.

Reg. 11655.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n2 \n  \nI. Overview  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the un iversal waste program, as \nthis would provide generators increased flexibility and encourage the continued responsible \nmanagement of discarded aerosol cans, as well as reduce reliance on disposal in landfills and \ncombustors. ACC agrees that  aerosol cans ful fill the criteria identified by EPA upon establishing \nthe universal waste program, and  that adding these wastes to the program will help EPA achieve \nits stated goals : 1) encourage resource conservation while ensuring adequate protection of h uman \nhealth and the environment,  2) improve implementation of the current Subtitle C haza rdous \nwaste regulatory program, and 3) provide incentives that result in less of these wastes disposed in \nmunicipal landfills or combustors.  \n \nACC has advocated4 that EPA add aerosol cans  to the RCRA universal waste program because \nthe program is a proven method of streamlining federal and state regulatory waste management \nfor cer tain kinds of commonly generated qualifying waste and  reduc ing recordkeeping and \nnotification requiremen ts.  ACC also supports the Agency\u2019s decision not to impose size \nlimitations on aerosol cans, which if in place would diminish the likelihood that a generator \nwould choose to follow the universal waste management program, as opposed  to simply abiding \nby requirements under the full suite of hazardous waste regulations. By adding aerosol cans to \nthe universal waste program, EPA would reduce the complexity of the waste management \nrequirements for aerosol cans and incentivize recycling p ractices.   \n \nHowever, the Agency\u2019 s proposa l could be improved by addressing the following issues :   \n \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify whether or to what extent aerosol cans exhibit th e reactivity \ncharacteristic.  \n\uf0b7 EPA should clarify when an aerosol can is considered empty . \n\uf0b7 EPA should allow aerosol cans that show evidence of leakage to be considered and \nmanaged as universal waste . \n\uf0b7 EPA should adopt a flexible approach to accumulation  of universal waste aerosol cans . \n\uf0b7 EPA should ensure that limitations on puncturing and draini ng are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \n \nII. EPA should clarify o r revise a number of assumptions and positions in the proposal  \n \n \nA. EPA should clarify whether and to what extent aerosol cans exhibit the reactivity \ncharac teristic .  \n \nEPA states in the proposed rule  that aerosol cans that meet the RCRA empty definition may be \nrecycled as scrap metal, and are not subject to hazardous waste regulation  or included in the \n                                                           \n4 ACC comments to the EPA Regulatory Reform Task Force, May 15, 2017, Docket No. EPA -HQ-OA-2017 -0190.  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n3 \n universal waste rule.5 According to EPA, a discarded aerosol can may qualify as a universal \nwaste  if the can is not empty and contains a listed or characteristic waste. ACC notes , however, \nthat a 1987 EPA memorandum suggested that \u201caerosol cans free of hazardous waste, but  [that]  \n\u2026 contained propellant \u2026 would be a RCRA hazardous waste because they demonstrate the \nhazardous waste characteristic of reactivity.\u201d6 EPA has also recognized in the  current  proposal \nthat aerosol cans may contain flammable propellants which may result in the aerosol can being \ndesignated as an ignitable waste, and may be \u201chazardous waste for o ther reasons when \ndiscarded.\u201d7 EPA has recognized the importance to stakeholders of clarifying its position on \nwhether \u201caerosol cans are considered reactive hazardous waste.\u201d8 However, EPA has no t \nclarified whether it has made a categorical determinat ion that aerosol cans are  by themselves \nD003 reactive wastes. Such a determination would run counter to  at least one  existing state \nregulatory program,9 and as a c onsequence, if an aerosol can were to be discarded, generators \nwould need to show that the can is empty and that the can itself is not reactive or other \ncharacteristic waste.  EPA notes on page 11656 the following:  \n \n\u201cThe can itself is typically a small steel or aluminum container, designed to be \nhand -held, which is sealed with its contents under  pressure. The can's design is \nintended to prevent unwanted releases of the contents to the environment under \nnormal handling and storage conditions. However, when aerosol cans are \nmismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the resulting incr ease \nin internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength of the can, \nthereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of bursting, the \ncontents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far above \nambient envi ronmental conditions, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize and be \nforcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can bursts as \na result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the contents \nof the can may rea dily catch fire as they are released and exposed to atmospheric \noxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u201cfireball\u201d; (2) the bottom of the can may \ndetach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, causing the \nupper part of the can to becom e a projectile; or (3) the can may fragment as it \nbursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal should not leave  open the possibility that all unpunctured  aerosol cans  could be \nconsidered D003 reactive waste, preventing the discard of those cans into, for example, scrap \nmetal hoppers.  Solid waste generators are required by law to make an accurate determination as \nto whether a waste is hazardous waste,10 and the A gency needs to address this issue to facilitate \naccurate waste determinations.  \n \nOhio\u2019s universal waste program , however, recognizes that the contents of the container control \nwhether or not the aerosol can will be considered reactive : \u201c[a]n aerosol container is not a \n                                                           \n5 83 Fed.

EPA\u2019s final rule should clarify when an aerosol can is consider ed empty  \n \nEPA\u2019s definition of aerosol can is further complicated by a lack of clarity on when an aerosol \ncan is considered  \u201cempty. \u201d ACC suggests that EPA  harmonize this definition with existing state \nprograms  in order to more practically apply the RCRA empty rule to aerosol cans. For example, \nMinnesota guidance currently reco gnizes an aerosol can as \u201cempty\u201d when the can : 1) contains no \ncompressed igni table gas propellant or product;  2) all liquid product that can be dispensed \nthrough the v alve has been; and  3) less than 3% of the product capacity of the container \nremains.17 Minnesota\u2019s guidance also recognizes that documenting tha t an aerosol can meets this \nstandard can be impractical  and therefore  provides that aerosol cans may be assumed empty \nwhen both of the following criteria are satisfied: 1) \u201cno liquid is felt or heard when the can is \nshaken by hand ;\u201d and 2) when \u201cno gas or liquid is released when the spray /discharge  valve is \nactivated  and the container is rotated through all directions, as long as the valve is not observably \nor known to be clogged .\u201d18 Minnesota\u2019s practical  guidance provides clarity o n how to make \n\u201cempty\u201d  determinations for aerosol cans. Together with clarifications in the final rule that \naerosol cans  themselves do not categorically exhibit the characteristic o f reactivity , EPA\u2019s final \n                                                           \n11 OAC Rule 3745 -273-89(A )(2)(b).   \n12 Ohio\u2019s guidance also states \u201c A non -empty aerosol can must be managed as a reactive hazardous waste if the \ncontents exhibit the reactivity characteristic.\u201d  Non -empty aerosol cans and reactivity , AnswerID: 478, September \n29, 2006 , available at  http://ohioepa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/478/~/non -empty -aerosol -cans-and-\nreactivity .  \n13 Id.  \n14 Id., pointing out that these are chemical reactions. \n15 Id.  \n16 If such a can is not recycled, the generator would need to make a hazardous waste determination, and would \ndetermine whether the can met the reactivity characteristic based on the contents of the can.  \n17 Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, Waste aerosols and compressed gas cylinders, Guidance for generators and \ncollection sites , December 31, 2017, available at https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/default/files/w -hw4-00.pdf .  \n18 Id. \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n5 \n rule should also adopt the Minnesota clarifying language for determining when an aerosol can \nqualifies as \u201cempty .\u201d  \n \n \nC. EPA\u2019s final rule should allow aerosol cans that show evidenc e of leakage to be \nconsidered and managed as universal waste  \n \nEPA\u2019s proposal limits universal waste aerosol cans to only those that are \u201cdiscarded, intact, non -\nempty hazardous waste.\u201d 19 However,  EPA\u2019s current universal waste program for batteries , as \nwell as other state programs , allow for the management of universal wastes that show evidence \nof leakage , spillage, or damage . For example, w hile EPA states that \u201cuniversal waste batteries \nare intended to be intact,\u201d the A gency \u201crecognizes that batteries may become damaged or broken \nduring handling.\u201d20 EPA therefore requires that universal waste handlers contain universal waste \nbatteries in a closed, structurally sound container if the battery shows \u201cevidence of leakage, \nspillage, or damages that could cause le akage under reasonable foreseeable conditions in a \ncontainer.\u201d21  \n \nEPA should adopt a position consistent with Colorado\u2019s program. While the C olorado program \ndefines batteries as \u201cintact and unbroken, \u201d22 the program does not define aerosol cans in the \nsame manner. Moreover, the Colorado program, similar to EPA\u2019s guidance, simply requires \nhandlers to contain universal waste aerosol cans that show evidence of \u201cleakage, spillage, or \ndamage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions in a separate individual \ncontainer.\u201d23 ACC therefore encourages EPA to finali ze a rule whereby all discarded  aerosol \ncans qualify as universal waste , consistent with the approach the Agency and Colorado have \nalready taken with respect to other universal wastes as well as aerosol cans that show evidence of \nleakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably foreseeable conditions.  \n \n \nD. EPA should adopt  a flexible approach to accumulation  \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should provide for a universal waste satellite accumulation area that allows for \naccumulation in up to a 55 -gallon drum. The one -year accumulation period for universal waste \naerosol cans should then begin when cans are moved from the universal waste satellite \naccumulation area to the primary universal waste accumulation area.  This approach is consistent \nwith guidance under  the Ohio state universal  waste program:  \n \n\u201cA handler of UW may punc ture or crush an aerosol container to remove and \ncollect the contents of the aerosol container rendering the container empty. A \nhandler who generates the UW aerosol containers can collect these containers at a \nuniversal waste satellite accumulation area co nsisting of a container or unit \n                                                           \n19 83 Fed. Reg. 11660.  \n20 RCRA, Supe rfund & EPCRA Call Center Monthly Report, Broken Batteries as Universal Wastes , September \n2002, RO 14634.  \n21 Broken Batteries as Universal Waste  (citing 40 CFR sections 273.13(a)(1) and 273.33(a)(1)).  \n22 Considering the contents of a battery could be signifi cantly harmful to human health and the environment.  \n23 6 COLO.

The aerosol \ncontainers must be moved to the main UW storage or puncturing area when it is \nfull, where it may be a ccumulated for up to one year. This is th e only type of \nuniversal waste where a satellite accu mulation container may be used.\u201d24 \n \nEPA should not assume  that hazardous waste generators and universal waste handlers will or \ncurrently engage in drastically different puncturing and draining activ ities. While the universal \nwaste program allows for the accumulation of such waste for up to a year, ACC does not expect \nthat this streamlined capability would result in universal waste handlers puncturing and draining \na significantly greater number of aer osol cans at one time than hazardous waste generators. \nHazardous waste generators already process these cans in large batches, and ACC expects those \npractices to continue by universal waste handlers at a similar pace.  \n \n \nIII. EPA should ensure that limitations o n puncturing and draining are reasonable and \nfacilitate implementation of the universal waste program.  \n \nEPA has proposed a number of limitations on the puncturing and draining of non-empty aerosol \ncans to be applicable at the federal level. Because the uni versal waste program is generally less \nstringent than the preexisting RCRA hazardous waste rules, states must decide to adopt the \nupdated federal definition of unive rsal waste. ACC recognizes EPA\u2019s effort to strike an \nappropriate balance between existing s tate universal waste program requirements for discarded \nnon-empty aerosol cans and the proposed rule. EPA should finalize a rule that provides for fewer \nlimitations on puncture and draining activities in order to allow states to decide whether to opt in \nand provide additional limitations of their own , if needed .  \n \n \nA. Methods a nd means of puncturing : \n \nEPA\u2019s final rule should not include a require ment  that puncturing and draining activities be done \nusing only commercially available devices, as similar restrictions are not used in other state \nregulatory programs.  State regulatory programs such as California  and Ohio  do not impose such \nrequirements. California\u2019s state program, for example, requires that the handler ensures aerosol \ncans are processed using \u201cequipment designed, maintained, and operated so as to prevent f ire, \nexplosion, and the unauthorized release of any universal waste or component of a universal \nwaste to the environment.\u201d25 Moreover, Ohio\u2019s state program requires handlers to \u201cuse \ncommercially available equipment, or equipment specifically custom designed  or retrofitted \naccording to accepted engineering practices based on established codes, standards, published \ntechnical reports, or similar peer reviewed documents, to puncture or crush and empty aerosol \ncontainers within an enclosed compartment.\u201d26 EPA\u2019s fi nal rule should aim to be consistent with \nother state universal waste programs that do not require puncturing and draining activities to be \ndone only using commercially available devices.  \n                                                           \n24 Ohio Specific Universal Waste, Hazardous Waste Program, P. 4, available at  \nhttp://www.epa.ohio.gov/portals/32/pdf/UW%20Ohio%20Specific%2018.pdf .  \n25 CA Health and Safety Code, section 25201.16(h)(2).  \n26 OAC Rule 3745 -273-13(E)(4)(a) and 3745 -273-33(E)(4)(a).  \nACC Comments: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations  \nDocket No. EPA \u2013HQ\u2013OLEM \u20132017 \u20130463  \nMay 15, 2018  \n7 \n  \n \nB. Post puncture and draining activity  \n \nThe Agency should app ly the recycling unit exemption to the puncturing device, containers \ndirectly connected to the puncturing device, and any filters directly connected to containers \nreceiving the accumulated contents of the aerosol cans.27 EPA already recognizes that puncturi ng \nand draining, \u201cif performed as part of the recycling process, is exempt from RCRA permitting \nrequirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).\u201d28 EPA has proposed to require that universal waste \nhandlers \u201cconduct puncturing and draining activities using a device specif ically designed to \nsafely puncture aerosol cans and contain the residual contents and any e missions thereof.\u201d29 The \nAgency also proposes that universal waste handlers immediately transfer contents of a waste \naerosol can or puncturing device to a conta iner or tank that meets the applicable requirements of \n40 CFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17 , but later requires a hazardous waste determination be \nconducted on the drained  contents per 40 CFR 262.11 to decide whether or not the drained \ncontents are actu ally fully regulated hazardous waste .30 EPA should clarify that disconnect ion or \nremoval of spent filters , accumulation containers , or contents from the recycle unit is view ed as a \nnew point of generation  and thus the point at which  a hazardous waste determination per 40 CFR \n262.11 must be made.  The Agency should also take this opportunity to clarify when a spent air \nfilter might be considered fully regulated hazardous waste (e.g. when the recycle unit is used to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans that contained P - or U-listed commercial chemical products) and \nthat spent air filters and  drained aerosol contents are not considered F - or K-listed hazardous \nwastes.  \n \n \nIV. Technical Correction \n \nEPA states that it is making four technical corrections to the universal waste standards for \nmercury-containing equipment.31 ACC believes that the Agency has inadvertently omitted \nreference to satellite a ccumulation requirements now located at 40 CFR 262.15 and the \nconditions for a very small quantity generator at 40 CFR 262.14 as part of its proposed technical \ncorrection. ACC requests that the final rule language be revised to refer to the requirements of 40 \nCFR 262.14, 262.15, 262.16 or 262.17, as applicable  for each respective section of 40 CFR \n273.13(c)(2)(iii) and (iv) and 273.33(c)(2)(iii) and (iv).  \n \n \nV. Conclusion  \n \nACC generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal to add aerosol cans to the universal waste program in \norder to increase recycling and streamline the regulatory framework for aerosol cans. In order to \n                                                           \n27 These are a necessary part of the recycling unit or \u201cdevice designed to saf ely puncture aerosol cans and contain \nthe residual contents and any emissions thereof.\u201d Id.  \n28 83 Fed.

While PCA is in support of this rule, PCA believes that EPA should \nalso allow for non- intact hazardous aerosol cans to be managed as universal waste and should revise \nthe labeling requirements to provide more flexible labeling language .  \n \nII. EPA Should Allow Non -Intact Hazardous Aerosol  Cans to be Managed as \nUniversal Waste  \n \nAlthough the proposal is an improvement over the current requirements by potentially \nreducing the regulatory burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans, the benefits of the rules could \nbe greatly enhanced by allo wing  non- intact hazardous aerosol cans to be managed together as \nuniversal waste.  Allowing all intact and non- intact  hazardous waste aerosol cans to be managed \ntogether in accumulation containers is more likely to ensure that all hazardous waste aerosol cans are proposed disposed of as universal waste  and cans showing evidence of leakage would be properly \ncontained while waiting to be punctured on -site for further recycling or shipped off- site for proper \nmanagement.  \n Allowing aerosol cans that show evidence  of leakage (non- intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations for universal waste batteries.  Universal waste handlers may manage leaking (non -intact) batteries as universal waste provided the \ncompromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container; the handler must ensure any released materials are properly contained, characterized, and managed accordingly.  EPA\u2019s approach for identifying non- qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaki ng or otherwise damaged \nwhere contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d\n1 is subjective.  Creating separate \nregulatory requirements for intact and non- intact cans potentially eliminates the recycling \nopportunity for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non- compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single  management approach  for all hazardous waste aerosol cans  is allowed, the burden for \ngenerators \u2013 to evaluate each can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans, and comply wit h \ndifferent complex standards for what may appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste \u2013 will not be measurably \nreduced.  \n \nIII. EPA Should Allow Flexible  Labeling Language  \n \nPCA  requests that EPA allow flexibility for the  label ing of an aerosol  container or can with \nany words that identify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container.

Kollar : \nThe Portland Cement Association (\u201cPCA\u201d) appreciates the opportunity to submit  comments \non the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (\u201cEPA\u201d) Proposed Rule on Increasing Recycling: Adding \nAerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations , 83 Fed. Reg. 11654 ( Mar. 16, 2018)  (\u201cProposed \nRule\u201d) . \n \nPCA, founded in 1916, is the premier policy, research, education, and market intelligence \norganization serving Amer ica\u2019s cement manufacturers. PCA members represent 92 percent of US \ncement production capacity and have facilities in all 50 states. The Association promotes safety, \nsustainability, and innovation in all aspects of construction, fosters continuous improveme nt in \ncement manufacturing and distribution, and generally promotes economic growth and sound infrastructure investment. \n \nI. Introduction \n \nPCA  is very supportive of EPA\u2019s efforts on regulatory reform and reducing the re gulatory \nburden on manufacturers  to impr ove environmental outcomes and increase economic growth. This \nproposed rule  reducing the regulatory burden of managing hazardous waste aerosol cans  as universal \nwaste is another example of smart regulatory policy that will have a positive impact on the eco nomy \nwhile protecting the environment. \n \nRegulating hazardous waste aerosol cans under the universal waste rules will simplify \nmanaging  this common waste stream. Current regulations require detailed waste characterizations \nfor each can, difficult \u201cpoint of generation\u201d determinations, full satellite accumulation area requirements, and unnecessarily short time frames for generators to ship these materials off -site. The \nPCA Comments    \nDkt. No. EPA -HQ-OLEM \u20132017\u20130463 \nMay 15 , 2018  \n \n2 \n streamlined universal waste classification will reduce the compliance burden on generators w hile \nproviding an effective framework to encourage recycling and ensure proper management.  \n \n The proposed universal waste rules will simplify the disposal  requirements that apply to \nhazardous waste aerosol cans.  PCA does not e ndorse  designating non- hazardous aeros ol cans as \nuniversal waste and supports having the flexibility to manage non- hazardous and hazardous  aerosol \ncans a s separate waste streams.  While PCA is in support of this rule, PCA believes that EPA should \nalso allow for non- intact hazardous aerosol cans to be managed as universal waste and should revise \nthe labeling requirements to provide more flexible labeling language .  \n \nII. EPA Should Allow Non -Intact Hazardous Aerosol  Cans to be Managed as \nUniversal Waste  \n \nAlthough the proposal is an improvement over the current requirements by potentially \nreducing the regulatory burden specific to intact hazardous waste cans, the benefits of the rules could \nbe greatly enhanced by allo wing  non- intact hazardous aerosol cans to be managed together as \nuniversal waste.  Allowing all intact and non- intact  hazardous waste aerosol cans to be managed \ntogether in accumulation containers is more likely to ensure that all hazardous waste aerosol cans are proposed disposed of as universal waste  and cans showing evidence of leakage would be properly \ncontained while waiting to be punctured on -site for further recycling or shipped off- site for proper \nmanagement.  \n Allowing aerosol cans that show evidence  of leakage (non- intact cans) to also be managed as \nuniversal waste would be consistent with existing regulations for universal waste batteries.  Universal waste handlers may manage leaking (non -intact) batteries as universal waste provided the \ncompromised batteries are placed in a closed, structurally sound container; the handler must ensure any released materials are properly contained, characterized, and managed accordingly.  EPA\u2019s approach for identifying non- qualifying cans as those that \u201care not leaki ng or otherwise damaged \nwhere contents or propellants could be dispersed out of the can\u201d\n1 is subjective.  Creating separate \nregulatory requirements for intact and non- intact cans potentially eliminates the recycling \nopportunity for non -intact cans and establishes a higher risk for non- compliance with the rules.  \nUnless a single  management approach  for all hazardous waste aerosol cans  is allowed, the burden for \ngenerators \u2013 to evaluate each can against the \u201cintact\u201d criteria, segregate the cans, and comply wit h \ndifferent complex standards for what may appear to be the \u201csame\u201d waste \u2013 will not be measurably \nreduced.  \n \nIII. EPA Should Allow Flexible  Labeling Language  \n \nPCA  requests that EPA allow flexibility for the  label ing of an aerosol  container or can with \nany words that identify the aerosol cans or contents of the accumulation container. Providing more flexible labeling language will ease compliance without comprising p roper management of the \nwastes.  This may be accomplished by revisi ng language in proposed 40 CFR 262.273.34(f) as \nfollows: (proposed changes in italics and underlined)  \n                                                 \n1 Id. at 11,660.  \nPCA Comments    \nDkt. No. EPA -HQ-OLEM \u20132017\u20130463 \nMay 15 , 2018  \n \n3 \n  \n(f) Universal waste aerosol cans (i.e., each aerosol can), or a container in which the aerosol \ncans are contained, must be labeled or marked clearly with  any of the following phrases or \nother words to identify the contents of the container or can, such as, \u201caerosol can(s)\u201d, \n\u201cUniversal Waste\u2014Aerosol Can(s)\u201d, \u201cWaste Aerosol Can(s)\u201d, or \u201cUsed Aerosol Can(s).\u201d    \n \nIV. Conclusion  \n \nPCA appreciates the opportunity to provide comment  in support of  the proposed rule \nallowing for the treatment of hazardous waste aerosol cans as universal waste. PCA urges EPA to  \nrevise the rule to allow for non- intact hazardous aerosol cans to be managed as universal waste and  \nallow for flexible labeling language .

The EPA plays a significant role in making sure the environment is protected from man-made and natural disasters. This protection is critical as the natural environment is vital to the essence of human, fauna, flora, and other living species\u2019 existence. We all depend on the health of the natural environment to continue providing us with natural resources that serve as a daily necessity for our food and water. With the mal-treatment and little understanding of the environment, human beings are destroying a natural gift and basic need that will continue to be needed by future generations. Therefore, the implementation of hazardous waste aerosol cans into the Universal Waste Program is a crucial step towards eliminating further depletion of our most precious gift, the Earth.  The proposed rule indicates that the EPA highly recommends that hazardous waste aerosol cans should be incorporated into the existing list of EPA\u2019s Universal Waste Program. Currently, the Universal Waste Program considers four different categories as universal waste under their regulations which includes: batteries, pesticides, mercury-containing equipment, and lamps (US EPA 2). According to Encyclopedia Britannica, aerosol cans are usually sold in metal containers that release products in the form of a mist or foam such as hairspray or shaving cream. The issue with aerosol cans is that they originally contained chlorofluorocarbon which is a hazardous \nchemical compound used for the propellants of aerosol spray cans. After spraying the contents of the aerosol can, the compound is released into the air and soaked up by the ozone layer. The detrimental components of chlorofluorocarbon have been scientifically proven to decompose the ozone layer that is responsible for protecting all species on Earth from the powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Because of the harm that chlorofluorocarbon poses on Earth\u2019s creatures, the United States Federal government banned a majority of the uses of the compound in 1978. Manufacturers of aerosol can goods have replaced the destructive chlorofluorocarbon compound with hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide instead (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica). Although the detrimental propellant compound of aerosol cans has been resolved, the question of whether the product continues to be hazardous remains. As we know, aerosol cans are used on a daily basis for products ranging from personal hygiene to home maintenance to pesticides. As per the Consumer Specialty Products Association (CSPA), the United States alone has manufactured 3.82 billion aerosol cans to be dispersed to varying industries in 2015 alone (US EPA 1). Overall, the proposed rule will affect 18,000 facilities in 18 industries (Ibid). The top two industries who utilize aerosol cans and will see the most affects by the proposed rule are Retail Trade and Manufacturing (Ibid). The total affected large quantity generators for Retail Trade and Manufacturing are 4,225 (65%) and 1,327 (20%), respectively (Ibid). Both the affected economic sectors make up the majority of the affected sectors. The United States is clearly experiencing an accumulation of aerosol cans in vast quantities; therefore, where are the 3.82 billion cans going after their short life span after being used by humans? \nWith no proper instruction on disposing aerosol cans, industries as well as households are throwing away the empty products into the regular solid waste garbage. Then, the cans and normal solid waste are transferred to landfills were the aerosol cans sit as hazardous waste as they are not biodegradable. When exposed to the sun, the aerosol cans pose alarming public and environmental health issues as the cans explode into metal shards and release the remainder of the toxic product to the Earth (US EPA 1). With the 3.82 billion aerosol cans manufactured and used in the United States yearly, landfills are storing a dangerous amount of aerosol cans that are flammable, release propellant compounds, and toxic excess product (Ibid).        The indicated magnitude of the harm placed on Earth is happening exponentially, yet, some humans are quick to neglect its existence regardless of obvious indicators such as reoccurring natural disasters caused by climate change. The implementation of aerosol cans into the EPA\u2019s current Universal Waste Program will create a nationwide understanding, appreciation, and stewardship towards protecting our environment by properly disposing of aerosol cans. The Universal Waste Program is important now more than ever. The only way to improve the Earth is not by talking about change but instead physically creating small, but impactful, changes that will transform the nation on a larger scale. As city planners, our role is to persuade policymakers of the importance of delicate matters as such. Therefore, I strongly believe that aerosol cans should become a part of the Universal Waste Program in order to implement proper disposal of aerosol cans. Thank you for your time.

We do not collect comprehensive data on \nthem, however, our members have provided us with anecdotal information on the number of \ncans generated and how they are managed. Members report that they generate from as few \nas 240 cans per year to as many as 6000 cans per year, depending upon the size of the \nfacility. Most AF&PA members manage their cans by puncturing them to remove any \nremaining wastes (which wastes are then managed as either hazardous or industrial non-\nhazardous waste). The resulting empty cans are managed appropriately depending on \nwhether they are hazardous waste.  \n \nSeveral members also stated that if the rule were to be promulgated, their facilities would be \nable to move from small to very small quantity generator status. This would result in resource \nsavings without affecting environmental protection. In addition, a number of facilities noted that \nin order to do so in a compliant way, puncturing cans and managing the resulting waste is a \nresource intensive activity. And because resources are limited, identifying aerosol cans as \nuniversal waste would enable them to more easily manage those cans without necessarily \nemptying them on site. This would result in less likelihood of spills or other safety issues.  \n \nAll of our responding companies believe that listing aerosol cans as universal waste would \nsimplify their management in an environmentally protective manner which would result in \ngreater compliance and likely some cost/resource savings. Therefore, AF&PA strongly support \nmanagement of aerosol cans as universal wastes under the RCRA hazardous waste regulatory \nscheme.  \n \nWe appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule.

Reg. 11,654 (Mar. 16, 2018)  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Docket No. EPA -HQ- OLEM -2017-\n0463 \n \nVia regulations.gov  \nMay 15, 2018  \n     \nCalifornia Communities Against Toxics (\u201cCCAT\u201d)  submits these comments on the above -\ncaptioned U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cthe agency\u201d) proposed rulemaking \nfor the addition of hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d). CCAT  appreciates  the agency\u2019s interest in \naddressing existing problems and risks posed by the current management of hazardous  waste \naerosol cans. However, excusing hazardous waste facilities from important Subtitle C \nrequirements  is not the answer . EPA \u2019s proposal fails to comport  with RCRA , and its mandate to \nregulate hazardous wastes \u201cas necessary  protect h uman healt h and the environment .\u201d \n \nI. Background  \n \nAs EPA explains, aerosol cans are used widely for various products, like \u201cpaints, solvents, \npesticides, food, and personal care products, and many others.\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. 11656 (noting that \n3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the U.S. in 2015). These cans are hazardous wastes when \ndiscarded because they are ignitable or their contents contain a listed hazardous waste or exhibit \na hazardous waste characteristic. Id . Aerosol cans may contain a wide variety of chemicals and \ntoxic substances, including but not limited to, \u201c[e]thers, including ethyl ether, chlorinated \ncompounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners, and unknowns.\u201d Id . at \n11661.  \n \nThe m ismanagement of  hazardous waste aerosol cans present s seriou s risks to nearby \ncommunities, facility workers, and emergency responders. For example, EPA notes that the cans \ncould burst , causing their  chemical  contents to rapidly vaporize and be forcefully released. An \noverheated can could result in: the contents cat ching fire as they are released \u201ccreating a rapidly \nburning vapor \u2018fireball,\u201d the upper part of the can becoming a projectile, or the can fragmenting \nsuch that metal shards are released. Id .  \n  \nUnder the current regulatory system , the management of hazardous waste aerosol  cans is  \ngenerally subject to the full scope of RCRA\u2019s Subtitle C cradle -to-grave requirements. In \nresponse to a request by certain groups in the retail industry, EPA now proposes to add \nhazardous waste aerosol cans to its  \u201cuniversal  wastes \u201d regulatory system, which is less stringent \nthan the current full Subtitle C program. Id. at 11657 (explaining that in response to a 2014 \nnotice of data availability for the retail sector, approximately 35% of commenters \u201cspecifically \nsuggested tha t discarded aerosol cans be managed as universal waste\u201d). EPA describes the \nuniversal waste (\u201cUW\u201d)  regulatory system, set forth at 40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273, as \u201ca set of alternative \nhazardous waste management standards that operate in lieu of regulation under 40 CF R parts 260 \nthrough 272 for specified hazardous wastes. \u201d Id. Under the proposed UW regulation , existing \n \n \n2 \n exemptions continue to apply and generators,  transporters , and other s managing the aerosol cans  \nare subject to weaker  standards  than would otherwise be required under the Subtitle C program .  \n \nIf finalized, this action \u201cwould affect persons who generate, transport, treat, recycle, or dispose \nof hazardous waste aerosol cans\u2026unless those persons are households or very small  quantity \ngenerators (VSQGs).\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. at 11655. In particular, EPA expects the proposal  to affect \nover 18,000 industrial facilities, mostly retail and manufacturing. Id . (explaining that retail \naccounts for 65% of the affected large quantity generators ( LQG s) universe and manufacturing \naccounts for 20% of the affected LQG universe). EPA claims that this proposal \u201csimplifies \nhandling and disposal of the [hazardous waste aerosol cans] for generators\u201d and is \u201cexpected to \nfacilitate environmentally sound recycling  of the metal used to make the cans.\u201d Id . at 11658. The \nagency  \u201cbelieves that adding aerosol cans to the universal waste rule would make collection and \ntransportation of this waste to an appropriate facility easier, and therefore, will help facilitate \nrecycling and reduce the amount of aerosol cans disposed of in municipal landfills\u201d  and other \nnon-hazardous waste sites.  Id.  \nII. EPA\u2019s Proposal is Inc onsistent with RCRA .  \n \nFirst, RCRA  requires  EPA to regulate the management of hazardous wastes, including hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans, \u201cas necessary to protect human health and the environment.\u201d See, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (a)(4) (explaining that RCRA \u201cassur[es] that hazardous waste management \npractices are conducted in a manner which protects human healt h and the e nvironment.\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C . \u00a7 6922 (requiring EPA to set standards for generators of hazardous wastes that \u201cas may \nbe necessary to protect to human health and the environment.\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6923 (same for \ntransporters of hazardous wastes); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6924 (same for owners and operators of \nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities).  \nEPA\u2019s proposal  is not premised on RCRA \u2019s plain mandate to set standards that are necessary to \nprotect human health and the environment. Instead, it is bas ed on the eight -factor test set forth in \n40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81, which applies to petitions made by \u201cany person seeking to add a hazardous \nor category of hazardous waste\u201d to the  UW stream . Under this provision, EPA  determines \nwhether to grant or deny a person\u2019 s petition using the factors in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81. \u201cEPA\u2019s \ndecision will be based on the weight of the evidence showing that regulation under 40 CFR part \n273 \u201cis appropriate for the waste or category of waste; will improve management practices for \nthe wast e or category of waste; and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste \nprogram.\u201d  40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c) . In this proposal, EPA states  that \u201cnot every factor must be met \nfor a waste to be appropriately regulated under the universal waste system,\u201d but  \u201cconsideration \nof all the factors should result in a conclusion that regulating a particular hazardous waste under \npart 273 will improve waste management.\u201d Id. at 11658. One of the eight factors EPA conside rs \nunde r this test is whether  \n \n\u201c[t]he risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and \ntransport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific \nmanagement standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appr opriate to be added to 40 C .F.R. 273.13, 273.33, \nand 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would \n \n \n3 \n be protective of human health and the environment during accumulation and \ntransport \u201d \n \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e). This  UW test is  not consistent with EPA\u2019s  duty under RCRA to protect  \nhuman health and the environment . The consideration of this  crucial  requirement as just one of \nmany  factors that considers protectiveness in a limited way  and that EPA suggests need not be  \nmet does not  comport with the plain terms of the statute  and is unreasonable.  \nFurthermore, EPA\u2019s proposed UW standards unlawfully exempt  generators and  transporters of \nhazardous waste aerosol cans from important  requirements, like recordkeeping , reporting, and \nthe man ifest system, that are expressly mandated by RCRA and that EPA has deemed necessary \nto protect human health and the environment . For example,  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6922(a) (1) requires EPA \nto promulgate standards applicable to generators of hazardous waste that establish requirements \nfor \u201crecordkeeping practices that accurately identify the quantities of hazardous waste generated , \nthe constituents thereof which are significant in quantity or in potential harm to human health or \nthe environment, and the disposition of such wastes.\u201d That section also explicitly requires \nreporting and \u201cthe use of a manifest system and any other reasonable means necessary to assure \nthat all such hazardous waste generated is designated for treatment, storage, or disposal in, and \narrives at treatment, storage, or disposal facilities\u2026for which a permit has been issued as \nprovided in this subchapter\u2026\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a76922(a)(5) (6); see also 40 C.F.R. part 262. Similarly, \nRCRA requires EPA to set hazardous waste transporter standards that \u201cinclude but need not be \nlimited to requirements\u201d ensuring \u201ccompliance with the manifest system.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a76923(a)(4);  see also 40 C.F.R. part 263.   \nThe proposal also unlawfully allows unpermitted \u201chandlers\u201d  to receive hazardous waste aerosol  \ncans, store  them for one year, puncture and drain them, and then send them to other handlers or \ndestination sites. 83 Fed. Reg. 11661, 11657 (explaining that \u201chandlers include both facilities \nthat generate universal waste and facilities that receive universal waste f rom other universal \nwaste handlers, accumulate waste and then send the universal waste to another ha ndler, a \ndestination facility or a foreign destination.\u201d). In addition, handlers will be able to drain and \npuncture their own cans without a RCRA permit. RCRA requires these facilities engaged in \nthese practices (storage, treatment, and disposal) to be classified as hazardous waste facilities and \nbe subject to the specific treatment, storage, and disposal requirements  set forth in RCRA  and \nestablished by EPA,  including the requirement to have a hazardous waste permit. See 42 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 \u00a7 6924 and 6925; see also  40 C.F.R. part 265. EPA cannot, and should not, create a new, \nunpermitted cla ss of hazardous waste facilities . EPA claims that the proposed standards for  \nhandlers will protect human health and the environment, but as discussed below that assertion is \nunsupported, especially considering that  unpermitted  handlers  will not have the expertise to \nsafely puncture and drain the aerosol cans and manage the varied and unknown chemical \ncontents , and will not be subject to the full set  of oversight requirements set forth in  Subtitle C. It \nshould go without saying that c alling hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, \nstorage, and disposal  facilities \u201chandlers\u201d or \u201cuniversal waste\u201d facilities does not excuse EPA \nfrom setting the standards required by RCRA.   \nEPA has already established cradle- to-grave regulations for hazardous waste management \npursuant to RCRA\u2019s mandate  to set protective standards for f acilities manage  hazardous wastes . \nSee generally 40 C.F.R. parts 260- 272. To the extent EPA believes that any of those regulations \n \n \n4 \n are not necessary to protect human health and the environment from the potential risks  posed by \nthe management of hazardous w aste aerosol cans, the agency must make that demonstration . As \nexplained below, EPA has failed to do so in this rulemaking .  \nSecond , EPA\u2019s finding that its proposal is  protective of human health and the environment \nduring accumulation and transport  is arbi trary and capricious. 83 Fed. Reg. 11658. It is largely \nbased on the assumption that toxic contents of the cans will not be released. EPA has not \nadequately assessed  the full range of potential human health and the environmental risks  posed \nby managing  hazardous waste aerosol cans and their vastly diverse and \u201c unknown\u201d contents (83 \nFed. Reg. at 11661)  under the  less stringent UW system. Without this information, EPA simply \ncannot show that this proposal is protective of human health and the environment  as required by \nRCRA .  \nInstead  of properly considering the risks  associated with this proposal , EPA presents general, \nunsupported statements  in an effort to satisfy factor 5 of the UW test . For example,  EPA \ncursorily states  that as long as the cans remain intact, \u201cEPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol \ncans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not \ncontained as -generated under normal management conditions.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11658. EPA offers \nno support for  its assum ption that the cans will in fact remain intact when handlers are \naccumulating more of them for longer periods and transporting them without compliance with all \nof RCRA\u2019s requirements . EPA\u2019s statement does not at all account for the risks presented by the \nproposed puncturing and draining of the cans, and the resulting released contents . EPA has not \naddressed whether and what risks  could be posed by the  leakage or spillage of hazardous waste \naerosol cans , the incomplete or improper puncturing and draining of those cans , the mixing of \ntheir contents , or unused/intact cans that are expired or are recalled by the manufacturer.  \nAssessing these and other potential risks is especially important given the broad application of \nthis proposal to so many varied products containing different and unknown types of chemicals, \nwhich will necessarily pose different types of risks  to communities, site workers, emergency \nresponders, and the environment . In any event, the fact that the hazardous waste cans present \u201ca \nlower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained\u201d does not mean \nthat the risk associated with hazardous waste aerosol cans is itself low or that the proposed \nstandards are sufficient to protect human health and the environment against that risk.  \nEPA further states that the \u201cignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is \naddressed by\u201d standards set by D OT, OSHA, and local fire codes. But EPA offers no  explanation \nas to how those other standards satisfy RCRA\u2019s  requirement to protect human health and the \nenvironment , which as noted above, requires hazardous w aste facilities to comply with specific \nrequirements that are absent from this proposal, including the manifest system requirement.  \nEPA goes on to explain that the proposed standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler \u201cwould address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus \nEPA believes that the risks pose d by the activities proposed are addressed by the universal waste \ndesignation.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11659. EPA does not even know the full array of toxic chemicals that \ncould be in the hazardous waste aerosol cans and the risks they pose  when released , so it cannot \nreasonably determine whether the weaker UW management requirements it proposes will \nsufficiently address those risks . EPA cannot only assume  that unpermitted handlers puncturing \nand draining those cans will do so safely . EPA also fails to adequately add ress the  potential \nproblems posed by the puncturing and draining devi ces on which it relies.  For example, EPA \n \n \n5 \n neglects to account for  key EPA findings for one such machine currently in use,  the Katec \nAerosolv\u00ae System1, and only cursorily s ummarizes some of the findings made by EPA\u2019s now \ndefunct Environmental Technology Verification Program. EPA states that that machine \u201cwas \neffective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred,\u201d 83 \nFed. Reg. 11661, but  does not  address  the fact  that the carbon filter allowed the emissions \nbreakthrough or  discuss the risks posed by those emissions. Further, the machine\u2019s Colorimetric \nIndicator, used to monitor carbon filter breakthrough, \u201cdid not work as claimed and did not \neffectively monitor the carbon filter for breakthrough.\u201d2 Given these problems, EPA should have  \nassessed safer alternatives to this practice. Assessing these issues and identifying safe  puncturing \nand draining procedures  should not simply be lef t to th e handlers, particularly because they are \nnot required to have Subtitle C permits under EPA\u2019s proposal . Indeed, these complexities \nprovide further support for prohibiting handlers to puncture and drain hazardous waste cans, and \nrequiring any  facilities engaged in that practice to do so in accordance with a Subtitle C  \ntreatment, storage, and disposal permit required by RCRA.  \nEPA\u2019s proposal exempts handlers and transporters of hazardous waste aerosol cans from the  \ncrucial  land disposal (LDR) r equirements for testing, tracking, and recordkeeping. 83 Fed. Reg. \n11662. EPA\u2019s basis for this exemption seems to be simply that the existing universal waste \nhandlers and transporters are exempt from these requirements. This explanation is not sufficient; \nEPA must demonstrate  why the LDR exemption is appropriate for these particular hazardous \nwastes, which as EPA notes can include any number of different chemicals, and why compliance \nwith the LDR requirements is not necessary to protect human health and the  environment.  \nIII. EPA Has Not  Establish ed that its Proposal Will Improve Management of \nHazardous Aerosol Cans.  \nThroughout the proposal, EPA claims  that expects regulating hazardous aerosol cans as UW will \nincrease recycling or Subtitle C disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans that would otherwise \nbe sent to non- hazardous waste landfills and incinerators. EPA\u2019s assumption is again \nunsupported and arbitrary . Under the current  regulatory  system only VSQGs (and households) \nmay send their hazardous waste aerosol  cans to the non- hazardous waste sites, including landfills \nand incinerators . This  continues to be the case under EPA\u2019s proposal . Indeed, the proposal \nexpressly exempts VSQGs from managing their hazardous waste cans as UW . As EPA \nacknowledges in its Regulatory Impact Analysis , \u201cVSQGs are therefore likely to continue \noperating as VSQGs in the post -rule environment.\u201d ES -2. EPA states that it will encourage \nVSQGs to voluntarily participate in the UW program, but that hardly mea ns they will participate \nand that this proposal will increase recycling of hazardous wastes aerosol cans that are currently \nbeing sent  to non- hazardous waste sites .   \nIf EPA  truly aims  to reduce the number of hazardous waste aerosol cans entering the non-\nhazardous waste stream, as it should, the agency  must require VSQGs  to manage their wastes in \naccordance with the cradle- to-grave  requirements . At the very least, EPA must require VSQG s to \n                                                 \n1 See EPA and California Department of Toxic Substances Control, ETV Joint Verification Statement (Dec. 1999), \nhttps://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive -etv/web/pdf/06_vs_katec.pdf . \n2 See also  Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/def ault/files/w -hw4-00.pdf . \n(noting that \u201c[c]harcoal  and activated carbon filters attached to many commercial puncturing devices do not \neffectively capture hazardous waste propellants or gases for proper disposal or on their own protect your employees \nor the environment.\u201d)  \n \n \n6 \n participate in th is proposed program  (as California requires) . Failing to do so is arbitrary and \ncapricious in light of EPA\u2019 s claim that this proposal will divert wastes going to non -hazardous \nwaste sites . To the extent EPA is suggesting that SQGs and LQGs are unlawfully sending their \nhazardous waste aerosol cans to non- hazardous waste sites, EPA  should enforce the current \nSubtitle C program against the violators , assist them with compliance , and close existing \nregulatory loopholes, including recycling exemptions, that allow for such hazardous waste \nmismanagement in the fir st place, not weaken the protective standards  required by RCRA and  \nnecessary for the safe handling of  those wastes.  \nFurthermore, EPA\u2019s  claims that the proposed regulation will improve hazardous waste \nmanagement are at odds with cases involving problems with  existing state  UW programs  for \nhazardous waste aerosol cans . For example, California added hazardous waste aerosol cans to its \nUW program in 2001,3 but mismanagement of  aerosol cans  has continued. See, e.g., California \nv. Walgreen Co., 2012 WL 12903342 (Cal. Super.) (Stipulation for Entry of Final Judgment and \nPermanent Injunction) (over 600 California Walgreens stores alleged to have unlawfully \ncompacted, transported, and disposed of hazardous waste, including universal waste aerosol \ncans) ; California  v. Target Corp., 2011 WL 807383 (Cal. Super. 2011) (Final Judgment and \nPermanent Injunction on Consent) (over 150 California Target stores and regional distribution \ncenters alleged to have unlawfully compacted, transported, and disposed of hazardous waste , \nincluding a shipment of 2,250 pounds of hazardous waste aerosol cans to a regional food bank, \nwhich was not authorized to receive hazardous or universal waste ).4 EPA must identify and \nclosely evaluate these and any other cases of mismanagement that have occurred under existing \nstate universal waste programs.  \n*** \nFor all of these reasons, EPA should not proceed with its proposal to move hazardous waste \naerosol can s to the universal waste program , and instead should work to  ensure compliance with \nSubtitle C\u2019s protective  cradle- to-grave  requirements.  \nRespectfully on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics,  \nKhushi Desai  \nIsabel Seg arra Trevi\u00f1o  \nEarthjustice  \n                                                 \n3 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION\u2014HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES\u2014 AEROSOL CANS, \n2001 Cal.

Reg. 11,654 (Mar. 16, 2018)  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Docket No. EPA -HQ- OLEM -2017-\n0463 \n \nVia regulations.gov  \nMay 15, 2018  \n     \nCalifornia Communities Against Toxics (\u201cCCAT\u201d)  submits these comments on the above -\ncaptioned U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cthe agency\u201d) proposed rulemaking \nfor the addition of hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d). CCAT  appreciates  the agency\u2019s interest in \naddressing existing problems and risks posed by the current management of hazardous  waste \naerosol cans. However, excusing hazardous waste facilities from important Subtitle C \nrequirements  is not the answer . EPA \u2019s proposal fails to comport  with RCRA , and its mandate to \nregulate hazardous wastes \u201cas necessary  protect h uman healt h and the environment .\u201d \n \nI. Background  \n \nAs EPA explains, aerosol cans are used widely for various products, like \u201cpaints, solvents, \npesticides, food, and personal care products, and many others.\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. 11656 (noting that \n3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the U.S. in 2015). These cans are hazardous wastes when \ndiscarded because they are ignitable or their contents contain a listed hazardous waste or exhibit \na hazardous waste characteristic. Id . Aerosol cans may contain a wide variety of chemicals and \ntoxic substances, including but not limited to, \u201c[e]thers, including ethyl ether, chlorinated \ncompounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners, and unknowns.\u201d Id . at \n11661.  \n \nThe m ismanagement of  hazardous waste aerosol cans present s seriou s risks to nearby \ncommunities, facility workers, and emergency responders. For example, EPA notes that the cans \ncould burst , causing their  chemical  contents to rapidly vaporize and be forcefully released. An \noverheated can could result in: the contents cat ching fire as they are released \u201ccreating a rapidly \nburning vapor \u2018fireball,\u201d the upper part of the can becoming a projectile, or the can fragmenting \nsuch that metal shards are released. Id .  \n  \nUnder the current regulatory system , the management of hazardous waste aerosol  cans is  \ngenerally subject to the full scope of RCRA\u2019s Subtitle C cradle -to-grave requirements. In \nresponse to a request by certain groups in the retail industry, EPA now proposes to add \nhazardous waste aerosol cans to its  \u201cuniversal  wastes \u201d regulatory system, which is less stringent \nthan the current full Subtitle C program. Id. at 11657 (explaining that in response to a 2014 \nnotice of data availability for the retail sector, approximately 35% of commenters \u201cspecifically \nsuggested tha t discarded aerosol cans be managed as universal waste\u201d). EPA describes the \nuniversal waste (\u201cUW\u201d)  regulatory system, set forth at 40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273, as \u201ca set of alternative \nhazardous waste management standards that operate in lieu of regulation under 40 CF R parts 260 \nthrough 272 for specified hazardous wastes. \u201d Id. Under the proposed UW regulation , existing \n \n \n2 \n exemptions continue to apply and generators,  transporters , and other s managing the aerosol cans  \nare subject to weaker  standards  than would otherwise be required under the Subtitle C program .  \n \nIf finalized, this action \u201cwould affect persons who generate, transport, treat, recycle, or dispose \nof hazardous waste aerosol cans\u2026unless those persons are households or very small  quantity \ngenerators (VSQGs).\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. at 11655. In particular, EPA expects the proposal  to affect \nover 18,000 industrial facilities, mostly retail and manufacturing. Id . (explaining that retail \naccounts for 65% of the affected large quantity generators ( LQG s) universe and manufacturing \naccounts for 20% of the affected LQG universe). EPA claims that this proposal \u201csimplifies \nhandling and disposal of the [hazardous waste aerosol cans] for generators\u201d and is \u201cexpected to \nfacilitate environmentally sound recycling  of the metal used to make the cans.\u201d Id . at 11658. The \nagency  \u201cbelieves that adding aerosol cans to the universal waste rule would make collection and \ntransportation of this waste to an appropriate facility easier, and therefore, will help facilitate \nrecycling and reduce the amount of aerosol cans disposed of in municipal landfills\u201d  and other \nnon-hazardous waste sites.  Id.  \nII. EPA\u2019s Proposal is Inc onsistent with RCRA .  \n \nFirst, RCRA  requires  EPA to regulate the management of hazardous wastes, including hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans, \u201cas necessary to protect human health and the environment.\u201d See, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (a)(4) (explaining that RCRA \u201cassur[es] that hazardous waste management \npractices are conducted in a manner which protects human healt h and the e nvironment.\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C . \u00a7 6922 (requiring EPA to set standards for generators of hazardous wastes that \u201cas may \nbe necessary to protect to human health and the environment.\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6923 (same for \ntransporters of hazardous wastes); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6924 (same for owners and operators of \nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities).  \nEPA\u2019s proposal  is not premised on RCRA \u2019s plain mandate to set standards that are necessary to \nprotect human health and the environment. Instead, it is bas ed on the eight -factor test set forth in \n40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81, which applies to petitions made by \u201cany person seeking to add a hazardous \nor category of hazardous waste\u201d to the  UW stream . Under this provision, EPA  determines \nwhether to grant or deny a person\u2019 s petition using the factors in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81. \u201cEPA\u2019s \ndecision will be based on the weight of the evidence showing that regulation under 40 CFR part \n273 \u201cis appropriate for the waste or category of waste; will improve management practices for \nthe wast e or category of waste; and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste \nprogram.\u201d  40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c) . In this proposal, EPA states  that \u201cnot every factor must be met \nfor a waste to be appropriately regulated under the universal waste system,\u201d but  \u201cconsideration \nof all the factors should result in a conclusion that regulating a particular hazardous waste under \npart 273 will improve waste management.\u201d Id. at 11658. One of the eight factors EPA conside rs \nunde r this test is whether  \n \n\u201c[t]he risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and \ntransport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific \nmanagement standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appr opriate to be added to 40 C .F.R. 273.13, 273.33, \nand 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would \n \n \n3 \n be protective of human health and the environment during accumulation and \ntransport \u201d \n \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e). This  UW test is  not consistent with EPA\u2019s  duty under RCRA to protect  \nhuman health and the environment . The consideration of this  crucial  requirement as just one of \nmany  factors that considers protectiveness in a limited way  and that EPA suggests need not be  \nmet does not  comport with the plain terms of the statute  and is unreasonable.  \nFurthermore, EPA\u2019s proposed UW standards unlawfully exempt  generators and  transporters of \nhazardous waste aerosol cans from important  requirements, like recordkeeping , reporting, and \nthe man ifest system, that are expressly mandated by RCRA and that EPA has deemed necessary \nto protect human health and the environment . For example,  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6922(a) (1) requires EPA \nto promulgate standards applicable to generators of hazardous waste that establish requirements \nfor \u201crecordkeeping practices that accurately identify the quantities of hazardous waste generated , \nthe constituents thereof which are significant in quantity or in potential harm to human health or \nthe environment, and the disposition of such wastes.\u201d That section also explicitly requires \nreporting and \u201cthe use of a manifest system and any other reasonable means necessary to assure \nthat all such hazardous waste generated is designated for treatment, storage, or disposal in, and \narrives at treatment, storage, or disposal facilities\u2026for which a permit has been issued as \nprovided in this subchapter\u2026\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a76922(a)(5) (6); see also 40 C.F.R. part 262. Similarly, \nRCRA requires EPA to set hazardous waste transporter standards that \u201cinclude but need not be \nlimited to requirements\u201d ensuring \u201ccompliance with the manifest system.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a76923(a)(4);  see also 40 C.F.R. part 263.   \nThe proposal also unlawfully allows unpermitted \u201chandlers\u201d  to receive hazardous waste aerosol  \ncans, store  them for one year, puncture and drain them, and then send them to other handlers or \ndestination sites. 83 Fed. Reg. 11661, 11657 (explaining that \u201chandlers include both facilities \nthat generate universal waste and facilities that receive universal waste f rom other universal \nwaste handlers, accumulate waste and then send the universal waste to another ha ndler, a \ndestination facility or a foreign destination.\u201d). In addition, handlers will be able to drain and \npuncture their own cans without a RCRA permit. RCRA requires these facilities engaged in \nthese practices (storage, treatment, and disposal) to be classified as hazardous waste facilities and \nbe subject to the specific treatment, storage, and disposal requirements  set forth in RCRA  and \nestablished by EPA,  including the requirement to have a hazardous waste permit. See 42 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 \u00a7 6924 and 6925; see also  40 C.F.R. part 265. EPA cannot, and should not, create a new, \nunpermitted cla ss of hazardous waste facilities . EPA claims that the proposed standards for  \nhandlers will protect human health and the environment, but as discussed below that assertion is \nunsupported, especially considering that  unpermitted  handlers  will not have the expertise to \nsafely puncture and drain the aerosol cans and manage the varied and unknown chemical \ncontents , and will not be subject to the full set  of oversight requirements set forth in  Subtitle C. It \nshould go without saying that c alling hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, \nstorage, and disposal  facilities \u201chandlers\u201d or \u201cuniversal waste\u201d facilities does not excuse EPA \nfrom setting the standards required by RCRA.   \nEPA has already established cradle- to-grave regulations for hazardous waste management \npursuant to RCRA\u2019s mandate  to set protective standards for f acilities manage  hazardous wastes . \nSee generally 40 C.F.R. parts 260- 272.

But EPA offers no  explanation \nas to how those other standards satisfy RCRA\u2019s  requirement to protect human health and the \nenvironment , which as noted above, requires hazardous w aste facilities to comply with specific \nrequirements that are absent from this proposal, including the manifest system requirement.  \nEPA goes on to explain that the proposed standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler \u201cwould address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus \nEPA believes that the risks pose d by the activities proposed are addressed by the universal waste \ndesignation.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11659. EPA does not even know the full array of toxic chemicals that \ncould be in the hazardous waste aerosol cans and the risks they pose  when released , so it cannot \nreasonably determine whether the weaker UW management requirements it proposes will \nsufficiently address those risks . EPA cannot only assume  that unpermitted handlers puncturing \nand draining those cans will do so safely . EPA also fails to adequately add ress the  potential \nproblems posed by the puncturing and draining devi ces on which it relies.  For example, EPA \n \n \n5 \n neglects to account for  key EPA findings for one such machine currently in use,  the Katec \nAerosolv\u00ae System1, and only cursorily s ummarizes some of the findings made by EPA\u2019s now \ndefunct Environmental Technology Verification Program. EPA states that that machine \u201cwas \neffective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred,\u201d 83 \nFed. Reg. 11661, but  does not  address  the fact  that the carbon filter allowed the emissions \nbreakthrough or  discuss the risks posed by those emissions. Further, the machine\u2019s Colorimetric \nIndicator, used to monitor carbon filter breakthrough, \u201cdid not work as claimed and did not \neffectively monitor the carbon filter for breakthrough.\u201d2 Given these problems, EPA should have  \nassessed safer alternatives to this practice. Assessing these issues and identifying safe  puncturing \nand draining procedures  should not simply be lef t to th e handlers, particularly because they are \nnot required to have Subtitle C permits under EPA\u2019s proposal . Indeed, these complexities \nprovide further support for prohibiting handlers to puncture and drain hazardous waste cans, and \nrequiring any  facilities engaged in that practice to do so in accordance with a Subtitle C  \ntreatment, storage, and disposal permit required by RCRA.  \nEPA\u2019s proposal exempts handlers and transporters of hazardous waste aerosol cans from the  \ncrucial  land disposal (LDR) r equirements for testing, tracking, and recordkeeping. 83 Fed. Reg. \n11662. EPA\u2019s basis for this exemption seems to be simply that the existing universal waste \nhandlers and transporters are exempt from these requirements. This explanation is not sufficient; \nEPA must demonstrate  why the LDR exemption is appropriate for these particular hazardous \nwastes, which as EPA notes can include any number of different chemicals, and why compliance \nwith the LDR requirements is not necessary to protect human health and the  environment.  \nIII. EPA Has Not  Establish ed that its Proposal Will Improve Management of \nHazardous Aerosol Cans.  \nThroughout the proposal, EPA claims  that expects regulating hazardous aerosol cans as UW will \nincrease recycling or Subtitle C disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans that would otherwise \nbe sent to non- hazardous waste landfills and incinerators. EPA\u2019s assumption is again \nunsupported and arbitrary . Under the current  regulatory  system only VSQGs (and households) \nmay send their hazardous waste aerosol  cans to the non- hazardous waste sites, including landfills \nand incinerators . This  continues to be the case under EPA\u2019s proposal . Indeed, the proposal \nexpressly exempts VSQGs from managing their hazardous waste cans as UW . As EPA \nacknowledges in its Regulatory Impact Analysis , \u201cVSQGs are therefore likely to continue \noperating as VSQGs in the post -rule environment.\u201d ES -2. EPA states that it will encourage \nVSQGs to voluntarily participate in the UW program, but that hardly mea ns they will participate \nand that this proposal will increase recycling of hazardous wastes aerosol cans that are currently \nbeing sent  to non- hazardous waste sites .   \nIf EPA  truly aims  to reduce the number of hazardous waste aerosol cans entering the non-\nhazardous waste stream, as it should, the agency  must require VSQGs  to manage their wastes in \naccordance with the cradle- to-grave  requirements . At the very least, EPA must require VSQG s to \n                                                 \n1 See EPA and California Department of Toxic Substances Control, ETV Joint Verification Statement (Dec. 1999), \nhttps://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive -etv/web/pdf/06_vs_katec.pdf . \n2 See also  Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, https://www.pca.state.mn.us/sites/def ault/files/w -hw4-00.pdf . \n(noting that \u201c[c]harcoal  and activated carbon filters attached to many commercial puncturing devices do not \neffectively capture hazardous waste propellants or gases for proper disposal or on their own protect your employees \nor the environment.\u201d)  \n \n \n6 \n participate in th is proposed program  (as California requires) .

Reg. 11,654 (Mar. 16, 2018)  ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Docket No. EPA -HQ- OLEM -2017-\n0463 \n \nVia regulations.gov  \nMay 15, 2018  \n     \nCalifornia Communities Against Toxics (\u201cCCAT\u201d)  submits these comments on the above -\ncaptioned U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d or \u201cthe agency\u201d) proposed rulemaking \nfor the addition of hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d). CCAT  appreciates  the agency\u2019s interest in \naddressing existing problems and risks posed by the current management of hazardous  waste \naerosol cans. However, excusing hazardous waste facilities from important Subtitle C \nrequirements  is not the answer . EPA \u2019s proposal fails to comport  with RCRA , and its mandate to \nregulate hazardous wastes \u201cas necessary  protect h uman healt h and the environment .\u201d \n \nI. Background  \n \nAs EPA explains, aerosol cans are used widely for various products, like \u201cpaints, solvents, \npesticides, food, and personal care products, and many others.\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. 11656 (noting that \n3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the U.S. in 2015). These cans are hazardous wastes when \ndiscarded because they are ignitable or their contents contain a listed hazardous waste or exhibit \na hazardous waste characteristic. Id . Aerosol cans may contain a wide variety of chemicals and \ntoxic substances, including but not limited to, \u201c[e]thers, including ethyl ether, chlorinated \ncompounds, pesticides, herbicides, freons, foamers, corrosive cleaners, and unknowns.\u201d Id . at \n11661.  \n \nThe m ismanagement of  hazardous waste aerosol cans present s seriou s risks to nearby \ncommunities, facility workers, and emergency responders. For example, EPA notes that the cans \ncould burst , causing their  chemical  contents to rapidly vaporize and be forcefully released. An \noverheated can could result in: the contents cat ching fire as they are released \u201ccreating a rapidly \nburning vapor \u2018fireball,\u201d the upper part of the can becoming a projectile, or the can fragmenting \nsuch that metal shards are released. Id .  \n  \nUnder the current regulatory system , the management of hazardous waste aerosol  cans is  \ngenerally subject to the full scope of RCRA\u2019s Subtitle C cradle -to-grave requirements. In \nresponse to a request by certain groups in the retail industry, EPA now proposes to add \nhazardous waste aerosol cans to its  \u201cuniversal  wastes \u201d regulatory system, which is less stringent \nthan the current full Subtitle C program. Id. at 11657 (explaining that in response to a 2014 \nnotice of data availability for the retail sector, approximately 35% of commenters \u201cspecifically \nsuggested tha t discarded aerosol cans be managed as universal waste\u201d). EPA describes the \nuniversal waste (\u201cUW\u201d)  regulatory system, set forth at 40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273, as \u201ca set of alternative \nhazardous waste management standards that operate in lieu of regulation under 40 CF R parts 260 \nthrough 272 for specified hazardous wastes. \u201d Id. Under the proposed UW regulation , existing \n \n \n2 \n exemptions continue to apply and generators,  transporters , and other s managing the aerosol cans  \nare subject to weaker  standards  than would otherwise be required under the Subtitle C program .  \n \nIf finalized, this action \u201cwould affect persons who generate, transport, treat, recycle, or dispose \nof hazardous waste aerosol cans\u2026unless those persons are households or very small  quantity \ngenerators (VSQGs).\u201d  83 Fed. Reg. at 11655. In particular, EPA expects the proposal  to affect \nover 18,000 industrial facilities, mostly retail and manufacturing. Id . (explaining that retail \naccounts for 65% of the affected large quantity generators ( LQG s) universe and manufacturing \naccounts for 20% of the affected LQG universe). EPA claims that this proposal \u201csimplifies \nhandling and disposal of the [hazardous waste aerosol cans] for generators\u201d and is \u201cexpected to \nfacilitate environmentally sound recycling  of the metal used to make the cans.\u201d Id . at 11658. The \nagency  \u201cbelieves that adding aerosol cans to the universal waste rule would make collection and \ntransportation of this waste to an appropriate facility easier, and therefore, will help facilitate \nrecycling and reduce the amount of aerosol cans disposed of in municipal landfills\u201d  and other \nnon-hazardous waste sites.  Id.  \nII. EPA\u2019s Proposal is Inc onsistent with RCRA .  \n \nFirst, RCRA  requires  EPA to regulate the management of hazardous wastes, including hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans, \u201cas necessary to protect human health and the environment.\u201d See, e.g., 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 6902 (a)(4) (explaining that RCRA \u201cassur[es] that hazardous waste management \npractices are conducted in a manner which protects human healt h and the e nvironment.\u201d); 42 \nU.S.C . \u00a7 6922 (requiring EPA to set standards for generators of hazardous wastes that \u201cas may \nbe necessary to protect to human health and the environment.\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6923 (same for \ntransporters of hazardous wastes); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6924 (same for owners and operators of \nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities).  \nEPA\u2019s proposal  is not premised on RCRA \u2019s plain mandate to set standards that are necessary to \nprotect human health and the environment. Instead, it is bas ed on the eight -factor test set forth in \n40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81, which applies to petitions made by \u201cany person seeking to add a hazardous \nor category of hazardous waste\u201d to the  UW stream . Under this provision, EPA  determines \nwhether to grant or deny a person\u2019 s petition using the factors in 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81. \u201cEPA\u2019s \ndecision will be based on the weight of the evidence showing that regulation under 40 CFR part \n273 \u201cis appropriate for the waste or category of waste; will improve management practices for \nthe wast e or category of waste; and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste \nprogram.\u201d  40 C .F.R. \u00a7 273.81(c) . In this proposal, EPA states  that \u201cnot every factor must be met \nfor a waste to be appropriately regulated under the universal waste system,\u201d but  \u201cconsideration \nof all the factors should result in a conclusion that regulating a particular hazardous waste under \npart 273 will improve waste management.\u201d Id. at 11658. One of the eight factors EPA conside rs \nunde r this test is whether  \n \n\u201c[t]he risk posed by the waste or category of waste during accumulation and \ntransport is relatively low compared to other hazardous wastes, and specific \nmanagement standards proposed or referenced by the petitioner (e.g., waste \nmanagement requirements appr opriate to be added to 40 C .F.R. 273.13, 273.33, \nand 273.52; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would \n \n \n3 \n be protective of human health and the environment during accumulation and \ntransport \u201d \n \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.81(e). This  UW test is  not consistent with EPA\u2019s  duty under RCRA to protect  \nhuman health and the environment . The consideration of this  crucial  requirement as just one of \nmany  factors that considers protectiveness in a limited way  and that EPA suggests need not be  \nmet does not  comport with the plain terms of the statute  and is unreasonable.  \nFurthermore, EPA\u2019s proposed UW standards unlawfully exempt  generators and  transporters of \nhazardous waste aerosol cans from important  requirements, like recordkeeping , reporting, and \nthe man ifest system, that are expressly mandated by RCRA and that EPA has deemed necessary \nto protect human health and the environment . For example,  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6922(a) (1) requires EPA \nto promulgate standards applicable to generators of hazardous waste that establish requirements \nfor \u201crecordkeeping practices that accurately identify the quantities of hazardous waste generated , \nthe constituents thereof which are significant in quantity or in potential harm to human health or \nthe environment, and the disposition of such wastes.\u201d That section also explicitly requires \nreporting and \u201cthe use of a manifest system and any other reasonable means necessary to assure \nthat all such hazardous waste generated is designated for treatment, storage, or disposal in, and \narrives at treatment, storage, or disposal facilities\u2026for which a permit has been issued as \nprovided in this subchapter\u2026\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a76922(a)(5) (6); see also 40 C.F.R. part 262. Similarly, \nRCRA requires EPA to set hazardous waste transporter standards that \u201cinclude but need not be \nlimited to requirements\u201d ensuring \u201ccompliance with the manifest system.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a76923(a)(4);  see also 40 C.F.R. part 263.   \nThe proposal also unlawfully allows unpermitted \u201chandlers\u201d  to receive hazardous waste aerosol  \ncans, store  them for one year, puncture and drain them, and then send them to other handlers or \ndestination sites. 83 Fed. Reg. 11661, 11657 (explaining that \u201chandlers include both facilities \nthat generate universal waste and facilities that receive universal waste f rom other universal \nwaste handlers, accumulate waste and then send the universal waste to another ha ndler, a \ndestination facility or a foreign destination.\u201d). In addition, handlers will be able to drain and \npuncture their own cans without a RCRA permit. RCRA requires these facilities engaged in \nthese practices (storage, treatment, and disposal) to be classified as hazardous waste facilities and \nbe subject to the specific treatment, storage, and disposal requirements  set forth in RCRA  and \nestablished by EPA,  including the requirement to have a hazardous waste permit. See 42 U .S.C. \n\u00a7 \u00a7 6924 and 6925; see also  40 C.F.R. part 265. EPA cannot, and should not, create a new, \nunpermitted cla ss of hazardous waste facilities . EPA claims that the proposed standards for  \nhandlers will protect human health and the environment, but as discussed below that assertion is \nunsupported, especially considering that  unpermitted  handlers  will not have the expertise to \nsafely puncture and drain the aerosol cans and manage the varied and unknown chemical \ncontents , and will not be subject to the full set  of oversight requirements set forth in  Subtitle C. It \nshould go without saying that c alling hazardous waste generators, transporters, and treatment, \nstorage, and disposal  facilities \u201chandlers\u201d or \u201cuniversal waste\u201d facilities does not excuse EPA \nfrom setting the standards required by RCRA.   \nEPA has already established cradle- to-grave regulations for hazardous waste management \npursuant to RCRA\u2019s mandate  to set protective standards for f acilities manage  hazardous wastes . \nSee generally 40 C.F.R. parts 260- 272. To the extent EPA believes that any of those regulations \n \n \n4 \n are not necessary to protect human health and the environment from the potential risks  posed by \nthe management of hazardous w aste aerosol cans, the agency must make that demonstration . As \nexplained below, EPA has failed to do so in this rulemaking .  \nSecond , EPA\u2019s finding that its proposal is  protective of human health and the environment \nduring accumulation and transport  is arbi trary and capricious. 83 Fed. Reg. 11658. It is largely \nbased on the assumption that toxic contents of the cans will not be released. EPA has not \nadequately assessed  the full range of potential human health and the environmental risks  posed \nby managing  hazardous waste aerosol cans and their vastly diverse and \u201c unknown\u201d contents (83 \nFed. Reg. at 11661)  under the  less stringent UW system. Without this information, EPA simply \ncannot show that this proposal is protective of human health and the environment  as required by \nRCRA .  \nInstead  of properly considering the risks  associated with this proposal , EPA presents general, \nunsupported statements  in an effort to satisfy factor 5 of the UW test . For example,  EPA \ncursorily states  that as long as the cans remain intact, \u201cEPA expects that hazardous waste aerosol \ncans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not \ncontained as -generated under normal management conditions.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11658. EPA offers \nno support for  its assum ption that the cans will in fact remain intact when handlers are \naccumulating more of them for longer periods and transporting them without compliance with all \nof RCRA\u2019s requirements . EPA\u2019s statement does not at all account for the risks presented by the \nproposed puncturing and draining of the cans, and the resulting released contents . EPA has not \naddressed whether and what risks  could be posed by the  leakage or spillage of hazardous waste \naerosol cans , the incomplete or improper puncturing and draining of those cans , the mixing of \ntheir contents , or unused/intact cans that are expired or are recalled by the manufacturer.  \nAssessing these and other potential risks is especially important given the broad application of \nthis proposal to so many varied products containing different and unknown types of chemicals, \nwhich will necessarily pose different types of risks  to communities, site workers, emergency \nresponders, and the environment . In any event, the fact that the hazardous waste cans present \u201ca \nlower risk as compared to other types of hazardous waste that are not contained\u201d does not mean \nthat the risk associated with hazardous waste aerosol cans is itself low or that the proposed \nstandards are sufficient to protect human health and the environment against that risk.  \nEPA further states that the \u201cignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is \naddressed by\u201d standards set by D OT, OSHA, and local fire codes. But EPA offers no  explanation \nas to how those other standards satisfy RCRA\u2019s  requirement to protect human health and the \nenvironment , which as noted above, requires hazardous w aste facilities to comply with specific \nrequirements that are absent from this proposal, including the manifest system requirement.  \nEPA goes on to explain that the proposed standards for aerosol cans that are punctured and \ndrained at the handler \u201cwould address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus \nEPA believes that the risks pose d by the activities proposed are addressed by the universal waste \ndesignation.\u201d 83 Fed. Reg. 11659. EPA does not even know the full array of toxic chemicals that \ncould be in the hazardous waste aerosol cans and the risks they pose  when released , so it cannot \nreasonably determine whether the weaker UW management requirements it proposes will \nsufficiently address those risks . EPA cannot only assume  that unpermitted handlers puncturing \nand draining those cans will do so safely . EPA also fails to adequately add ress the  potential \nproblems posed by the puncturing and draining devi ces on which it relies.  For example, EPA \n \n \n5 \n neglects to account for  key EPA findings for one such machine currently in use,  the Katec \nAerosolv\u00ae System1, and only cursorily s ummarizes some of the findings made by EPA\u2019s now \ndefunct Environmental Technology Verification Program. EPA states that that machine \u201cwas \neffective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred,\u201d 83 \nFed. Reg. 11661, but  does not  address  the fact  that the carbon filter allowed the emissions \nbreakthrough or  discuss the risks posed by those emissions. Further, the machine\u2019s Colorimetric \nIndicator, used to monitor carbon filter breakthrough, \u201cdid not work as claimed and did not \neffectively monitor the carbon filter for breakthrough.\u201d2 Given these problems, EPA should have  \nassessed safer alternatives to this practice. Assessing these issues and identifying safe  puncturing \nand draining procedures  should not simply be lef t to th e handlers, particularly because they are \nnot required to have Subtitle C permits under EPA\u2019s proposal . Indeed, these complexities \nprovide further support for prohibiting handlers to puncture and drain hazardous waste cans, and \nrequiring any  facilities engaged in that practice to do so in accordance with a Subtitle C  \ntreatment, storage, and disposal permit required by RCRA.  \nEPA\u2019s proposal exempts handlers and transporters of hazardous waste aerosol cans from the  \ncrucial  land disposal (LDR) r equirements for testing, tracking, and recordkeeping. 83 Fed. Reg. \n11662. EPA\u2019s basis for this exemption seems to be simply that the existing universal waste \nhandlers and transporters are exempt from these requirements. This explanation is not sufficient; \nEPA must demonstrate  why the LDR exemption is appropriate for these particular hazardous \nwastes, which as EPA notes can include any number of different chemicals, and why compliance \nwith the LDR requirements is not necessary to protect human health and the  environment.  \nIII. EPA Has Not  Establish ed that its Proposal Will Improve Management of \nHazardous Aerosol Cans.  \nThroughout the proposal, EPA claims  that expects regulating hazardous aerosol cans as UW will \nincrease recycling or Subtitle C disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans that would otherwise \nbe sent to non- hazardous waste landfills and incinerators.

Some of \nthe members plan to submit additional commen ts.   \nOverall Comment:  NEWMOA\u2019s members generally support the concept of adding \naerosol cans to the universal waste rule. Our members believe that the universal waste \nregulatory framework is appropriate for the collection and management of hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans.  \n \nThe States of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode \nIsland, and Vermont offer the following comments and recommendations to improve and \nclarify this proposed rule for EPA\u2019s consideration.  \n \n1. Request: Destination faci lities that recycle universal waste and that do not store \nthat universal waste prior to recycling in accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2) \nmay be exempt from permitting under federal regulations. NEWMOA \nrecommends that EPA provide guidance on the period of ti me that a destination \nfacility may stage aerosol cans before a RCRA storage permit would be federally \nrequired.  \n2. Page 11655, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cNote that the \nexpected cost savings is based on the assumption  that all eligible states would \nadopt regulatory changes, once they are finalized. EPA requests comment on \nthis assumption.\u201d  \n \n2 \n \u2022 Given that the rule is optional, it is unlikely that all eligible states will adopt it. Perhaps \nEPA should determine the percentage of states that have adopted other optional universal \nwaste regulations to obtain a more realistic estimate of the economic impact of the \nproposed rule.  \n3. Page 11656, 1st column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHowever, when \naerosol cans are mismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the \nresulting increase in internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength \nof the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of \nbursting, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far \nabove ambient environmental conditi ons, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize \nand be forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can \nbursts as a result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the \ncontents of the can may readily catch fire a s they are released and exposed to \natmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) the bottom of \nthe can may detach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, \ncausing the upper part of the can to become a projectile;  or (3) the can may \nfragment as it bursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state in its final rule whether these scenarios meet the definition of \nreactivity, and aerosol cans should, therefore, be considered reactive under normal \nconditions or only whe n mismanaged. This question has been debated by \nregulators and the regulated community at length, and a clear EPA position would \nhelp generators and handlers make accurate and consistent waste determinations.  \n\u2022 The rule should include clearer and more speci fic safety measures to prevent the \ntypes of reactions described in the preamble (e.g., not storing in excessive heat or \nwith other materials that may cause a reaction).  \n4. Page 11656, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHazardous waste \naerosol c ans that contain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of (the) \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance \nwith instructions on the label. In general, the statement on aerosol pesticide product \nFIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of cans. \u201d (emphasis added) That section of the \npreamble goes on to discuss a 2004 EPA determination \u201c\u2026that puncturing aerosol \npesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore lawful \npursuant to FIFRA\u2026 provided certain conditions are met\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 While EPA has determined that puncturing of aerosol pesticide containers is \nlawful, it should explain further in the final rule preamble why FIFRA labels (\u201cin \ngeneral\u201d) state that puncturing is prohibited.  \n\u2022 Since ther e is also a universal waste category for waste pesticides, in its final rule \nEPA should address whether a handler can manage that waste under the less \nstringent provisions of the aerosol can requirements or if they must meet the \nprovisions of both.  \n3 \n 5. Page 11 658, 2nd column, end of 1st paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cA summary of \nhow the criteria in 40 CFR 273.81 apply to aerosol cans is described below. EPA \nsolicits comment on this analysis.\u201d  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 4th paragraph. The preamble states: \u201c5. Ri sks Posed by the \nWaste During Accumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to \nthe Risks Posed by Other Hazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards \nWould Be Protective of Human Health and the Environment During Accumulation \nand Transp ort (40 CFR 273.81(e))\u201d  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 5th paragraph, second sentence. The preamble goes on to \nstate: \u201cAs long as they remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste \naerosol cans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of  hazardous \nwaste that are not contained as -generated under normal management conditions. In \naddition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is addressed \nby standards set by the Department of Transportation, Office of Safety and Heal th \nAdministration, and local fire codes. These standards include requirements for \nouter packaging and can design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas \nand general pressure conditions. Finally, as discussed below, the proposed \nmanagement standard s for aerosol cans that are punctured and drained at the \nhandler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA \nbelieves that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the \nuniversal waste designation.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA sh ould include additional standards in its final rule for shipping and \naccumulation of universal waste aerosol cans designed to minimize the potential \nfor mixing incompatible wastes and causing a reaction. While measures are being \ntaken to prevent waste from  leaving the aerosol can, some leakage will be \ninevitable. NEWMOA suggests requiring separation of incompatible wastes \nrather than allowing separation. NEWMOA also recommends requiring that \nstorage areas meet temperature requirements that would reduce the likelihood of a \nstrong reaction.  \n\u2022 While NEWMOA agrees with having the management standards codified, EPA \nneeds to add language to clarify that after an aerosol can is punctured, it can no \nlonger be managed as universal waste. For hazardous waste generators,  \nmanagement of the removed product and/or propellant should be addressed to \nclarify that this subsequent management is not part of universal waste handling. \nMost SQGs and LQGs will only be handling their own waste aerosol cans and not \nthose received from o ff-site. If EPA\u2019s intent is to allow generators to manage their \nown waste aerosol cans as universal waste on -site prior to puncturing and making \ndeterminations on the separate waste streams generated by puncturing, this should \nbe made explicit in the rule.  \n6. Page 11660, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA also intends this \ndefinition to be limited to sealed containers whose intended use is to dispense a \nmaterial by means of a propellant or compressed gas. Aerosol cans are designed to \ncontain those materials until they are intended for release and to present minimal \n4 \n risk during normal storage and transport. Other types of containers, including \ncompressed gas canisters and propane cylinders, present a greater risk than aerosol \ncans and would not  be included.\u201d  \n\u2022 If this is the intention, it should be clearly stated in the final regulation, not just as \npart of the preamble. The proposed definition leaves room for interpretation and \nthe intent stated in the preamble to limit the definition to specific  sealed \ncontainers is therefore unenforceable.  \n7. Page 11660, 1st column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA requests \ncomment on whether to include a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of \nlimitations on the types of aerosol cans that would be eligible for the federal \nuniversal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit would be \nnecessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment \non the appropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the ty pes of \nmaterials that should fall under it.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA supports a size limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit would be \nappropriate, in our opinion. The 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table \nidentifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for each cat egory, specifies \u201ceach \nnot exceeding 1 L capacity .\u201d While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are not large, any size \ncould fall within the proposed definition. An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be \npurchased from home improvement stores; according to a Vermont solid waste \ndistrict manager, these containers are extremely expensive to dispose of due to \ntheir CFC content (approximately $375 per container disposal cost).  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also  strongly encourages adding language to the final rule to limit \napplicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d aerosol cans. A quick internet search produces \nvideos of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as hand -pump pesticide applicators, \nwhich both meet the proposed defini tion.  \n\u2022 A revised definition might state: \u201c\u2026means an intact container, that is a \nmanufactured product not to exceed 1 L capacity, in which gas under pressure is \nused to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or \nfoam.\u201d  \n8. Page 1 1661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is proposing \nthat puncturing and draining activities must be conducted by a commercial device \nspecifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the \nresidual contents a nd any emissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that \nto be evaluated by handlers and inspectors? NEWMOA recommends that EPA \naddress these questions in the final rule.  \n9. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has \npreviously investigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and \n5 \n draining device through EPA\u2019s Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) \nprogram. The ETV review demonstrated one type of drum -top puncturing and \ndraining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of \nvolatile of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 \n750 cans recommended by some manufacturers. The drum that cont ained the \ndrained liquid from the aerosol cans was also never more than 25% full before \nbreakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary to manufacturer \nrecommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthroug h\u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated \ncompounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal \nand gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of \npuncturing a nd draining devices currently available on the market (one Vermont \nsolid waste district manager stated that they have examined devices ranging in \ncost from $700 to $16,000), the only certain ways to ensure that puncturing and \ndraining activities are contai ning emissions are to either implement an air \nmonitoring program with recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices \nused are equipped with \u201cend of life\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is \noccurring.  \n10. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The pre amble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on establishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining \ndevices and limits on aerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that \nmay be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA sug gests adding language to clarify that once a can has been \npunctured, neither the can nor the collected contents remain universal waste. The \nhandler has generated at least two distinct waste streams and must make accurate \nhazardous waste determinations on b oth. Moreover, if the contents from different \ntypes of cans are mixed in the same collection container, a more complicated \ndetermination will result. And since the contents of various types of containers are \nlikely to be combined, the ultimate waste determ ination is more likely  to be \ninaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must \nbe conducted using a commercial device, this language does not carry through to \nthe definition. If  not specifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d \ndevices which would not have the instructions, recommendations, safety testing, \nand testing on emissions capture that NEWMOA believes are necessary to protect \nhuman health and the environment. As such, NEWMOA recommends revising the \nproposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct puncturing and draining activities using \na commercially -manufactured  device specifically designed to safely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents an d any emissions \nthereof.\u201d  \n6 \n \u2022 Finally, NEWMOA recommends requiring that a maintenance record be kept to \ndocument maintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for \nbreakthrough (that, at a minimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecomme ndations). NEWMOA also recommends that a record be kept \ndocumenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to demonstrate that \nincompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n11. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not \ncommercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from \nother entities in exchange for compensation).\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA recomme nds that the term \u201ccommercial processors\u201d be defined in the \nfinal rule. Based on the parenthetical statement, it is not clear how one \ndistinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from any handler who punctures/drains \naerosol cans since most handlers are compensa ted for receiving (and managing) \nuniversal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercial processers\u201d may be \nmanaging larger quantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they are more \nlikely to be using more sophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than \ngenerators, SQHs or even LQHs, especially if the commercial processor is a \npermitted TSDF. Such processors are also more experienced with and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limits of that equipment. L arger processors \nare also more likely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans \nand which of those materials are incompatible and which materials may have an \nadverse impact on the seals/gaskets of puncturing/draining equipment.  \n\u2022 It shoul d be clear that generators may continue to puncture and drain their own \non-site generated aerosol cans under 40 CFR 262 as generator treatment in a tank \nor container.  \n\u2022 It should be clear that a destination facility can puncture and drain aerosol cans \nreceiv ed from off -site if it\u2019s a recycling facility that doesn\u2019t store (number of days \nneed to be determined, see comment 1).  \n\u2022 It is NEWMOA\u2019s understanding that, as currently proposed, SQHs and LQHs can \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site if th ey do not accept \ncompensation for their services. What is EPA\u2019s logic for allowing SQHs and \nLQHs to puncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site while not being \nsubject to regulation as a destination facility? NEWMOA encourages EPA to \nrequire tha t aerosol cans received from other entities only be punctured and \ndrained at destination facilities.  \n\u2022 Since the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d is neither defined nor used in the proposed \nrule, is it EPA\u2019s intent to regulate facilities that accept compensation for aerosol \ncans received from off -site for puncturing and draining as destination facilities \n7 \n only?  Is compensation the only difference between allowing SQHs and LQHs to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site versus a destination \nfacility?    \n\u2022 NEWMOA would encourage EPA to require that destination facilities vent to an \nair pollution control device that discharges to the atmosphere.   \n12. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(1)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(1). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol can s must be accumulated in a container that is \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol cans and lacks \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably \nforeseeable conditions.\u201d  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may c ontain a wide array of products, NEWMOA believes the \naccumulation requirements for SQHs and LQHs should be revised to specify that \nwaste aerosol cans containing incompatible materials should not be accumulated \nin the same container.  \n13. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3 )/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cA (small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must \nrecycle the empty punctured aerosol cans\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 It should be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally avail able. If \nrecycling is not available in an area, does that mean that puncturing/draining of \naerosol cans is not an option in that location? There needs to be further discussion \nof this requirement in the preamble of the final rule.  \n14. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(ii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) \nuniversal waste aerosol can (including proper assembly, operation and maintenance \nof the unit, segr egation of incompatible wastes, and proper waste management \npractices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 Not only should EPA establish a written procedure, NEWMOA recommends \nadding the words \u201cand follow\u201d so the revised requirement would read: \u201cEstablish \nand follow  a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also recommends revising this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely \npuncture and remove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensure \nthe capture and containment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the \ncompatibility of the contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining \nequipment. In addition, NEWMOA believes that EPA should prohibit the \ncomingling of incompatible liquids when puncturing aerosol cans.  \n8 \n \n15. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(iii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEnsu re that puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires \nand to prevent the release of any component of universal waste to the environment. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on a solid, flat surface in \na well venti lated area.\u201d  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to puncture aerosol \ncans provided they \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission \nthereof.\u201d  This implies that all hazardous waste gases will be collected or captured \nduring the activity. If so, why must puncturing equipment be located in a well -\nventilated area? NEWMOA requests that EPA clarify this point in the final rule.  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also encourages EPA to require that puncturing and draining \nequipment be vented to an air po llution control device that discharges to the \natmosphere.  \nNEWMOA is a non -profit, non -partisan interstate association that was established by the \ngovernors of the New England states as an official interstate regional organization, in accordance \nwith Sectio n 1005 of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), to \ncoordinate in interstate hazardous and solid waste activities. The organization was formally \nrecognized by the U.S. EPA in 1986. NEWMOA membership is composed of the state \nenvironment agency programs that address pollution prevention, toxics use reduction, \nsustainability, materials management, hazardous waste, solid waste, emergency response, waste \nsite cleanup, underground storage tanks, and related environmental challenges in Connecti cut, \nMaine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. \nNEWMOA provides a strategic forum for effectively solving environmental problems through \ncollaborative regional initiatives that advance pollution prevention and sus tainability, promote \nsafer alternatives to toxic materials in products, identify and assess emerging contaminants, \nfacilitate adaptation to climate change, mitigate greenhouse gas sources, promote reuse and \nrecycling of wastes and diversion of organics, su pport proper management of hazardous and \nsolid wastes, and facilitate clean -up of contaminant releases to the environment.

At the point of \nbursting, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far \nabove ambient environmental conditi ons, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize \nand be forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can \nbursts as a result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the \ncontents of the can may readily catch fire a s they are released and exposed to \natmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) the bottom of \nthe can may detach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, \ncausing the upper part of the can to become a projectile;  or (3) the can may \nfragment as it bursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state in its final rule whether these scenarios meet the definition of \nreactivity, and aerosol cans should, therefore, be considered reactive under normal \nconditions or only whe n mismanaged. This question has been debated by \nregulators and the regulated community at length, and a clear EPA position would \nhelp generators and handlers make accurate and consistent waste determinations.  \n\u2022 The rule should include clearer and more speci fic safety measures to prevent the \ntypes of reactions described in the preamble (e.g., not storing in excessive heat or \nwith other materials that may cause a reaction).  \n4. Page 11656, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHazardous waste \naerosol c ans that contain pesticides are also subject to the requirements of (the) \nFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), including compliance \nwith instructions on the label. In general, the statement on aerosol pesticide product \nFIFRA labels prohibits the puncturing of cans. \u201d (emphasis added) That section of the \npreamble goes on to discuss a 2004 EPA determination \u201c\u2026that puncturing aerosol \npesticide containers is consistent with the purposes of FIFRA and is therefore lawful \npursuant to FIFRA\u2026 provided certain conditions are met\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 While EPA has determined that puncturing of aerosol pesticide containers is \nlawful, it should explain further in the final rule preamble why FIFRA labels (\u201cin \ngeneral\u201d) state that puncturing is prohibited.  \n\u2022 Since ther e is also a universal waste category for waste pesticides, in its final rule \nEPA should address whether a handler can manage that waste under the less \nstringent provisions of the aerosol can requirements or if they must meet the \nprovisions of both.  \n3 \n 5. Page 11 658, 2nd column, end of 1st paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cA summary of \nhow the criteria in 40 CFR 273.81 apply to aerosol cans is described below. EPA \nsolicits comment on this analysis.\u201d  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 4th paragraph. The preamble states: \u201c5. Ri sks Posed by the \nWaste During Accumulation and Transport Should Be Relatively Low Compared to \nthe Risks Posed by Other Hazardous Waste, and Specific Management Standards \nWould Be Protective of Human Health and the Environment During Accumulation \nand Transp ort (40 CFR 273.81(e))\u201d  \nPage 11658, 3rd column, 5th paragraph, second sentence. The preamble goes on to \nstate: \u201cAs long as they remain intact, therefore, EPA expects that hazardous waste \naerosol cans would present a lower risk as compared to other types of  hazardous \nwaste that are not contained as -generated under normal management conditions. In \naddition, the ignitability risk posed during accumulation and transport is addressed \nby standards set by the Department of Transportation, Office of Safety and Heal th \nAdministration, and local fire codes. These standards include requirements for \nouter packaging and can design, including limits on the amount of flammable gas \nand general pressure conditions. Finally, as discussed below, the proposed \nmanagement standard s for aerosol cans that are punctured and drained at the \nhandler would address the ignitability risk, and help prevent releases, and thus EPA \nbelieves that the risks posed by the activities proposed are addressed by the \nuniversal waste designation.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA sh ould include additional standards in its final rule for shipping and \naccumulation of universal waste aerosol cans designed to minimize the potential \nfor mixing incompatible wastes and causing a reaction. While measures are being \ntaken to prevent waste from  leaving the aerosol can, some leakage will be \ninevitable. NEWMOA suggests requiring separation of incompatible wastes \nrather than allowing separation. NEWMOA also recommends requiring that \nstorage areas meet temperature requirements that would reduce the likelihood of a \nstrong reaction.  \n\u2022 While NEWMOA agrees with having the management standards codified, EPA \nneeds to add language to clarify that after an aerosol can is punctured, it can no \nlonger be managed as universal waste. For hazardous waste generators,  \nmanagement of the removed product and/or propellant should be addressed to \nclarify that this subsequent management is not part of universal waste handling. \nMost SQGs and LQGs will only be handling their own waste aerosol cans and not \nthose received from o ff-site. If EPA\u2019s intent is to allow generators to manage their \nown waste aerosol cans as universal waste on -site prior to puncturing and making \ndeterminations on the separate waste streams generated by puncturing, this should \nbe made explicit in the rule.  \n6. Page 11660, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA also intends this \ndefinition to be limited to sealed containers whose intended use is to dispense a \nmaterial by means of a propellant or compressed gas. Aerosol cans are designed to \ncontain those materials until they are intended for release and to present minimal \n4 \n risk during normal storage and transport. Other types of containers, including \ncompressed gas canisters and propane cylinders, present a greater risk than aerosol \ncans and would not  be included.\u201d  \n\u2022 If this is the intention, it should be clearly stated in the final regulation, not just as \npart of the preamble. The proposed definition leaves room for interpretation and \nthe intent stated in the preamble to limit the definition to specific  sealed \ncontainers is therefore unenforceable.  \n7. Page 11660, 1st column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA requests \ncomment on whether to include a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of \nlimitations on the types of aerosol cans that would be eligible for the federal \nuniversal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit would be \nnecessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment \non the appropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the ty pes of \nmaterials that should fall under it.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA supports a size limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit would be \nappropriate, in our opinion. The 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table \nidentifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for each cat egory, specifies \u201ceach \nnot exceeding 1 L capacity .\u201d While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are not large, any size \ncould fall within the proposed definition. An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be \npurchased from home improvement stores; according to a Vermont solid waste \ndistrict manager, these containers are extremely expensive to dispose of due to \ntheir CFC content (approximately $375 per container disposal cost).  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also  strongly encourages adding language to the final rule to limit \napplicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d aerosol cans. A quick internet search produces \nvideos of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as hand -pump pesticide applicators, \nwhich both meet the proposed defini tion.  \n\u2022 A revised definition might state: \u201c\u2026means an intact container, that is a \nmanufactured product not to exceed 1 L capacity, in which gas under pressure is \nused to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or \nfoam.\u201d  \n8. Page 1 1661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is proposing \nthat puncturing and draining activities must be conducted by a commercial device \nspecifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the \nresidual contents a nd any emissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that \nto be evaluated by handlers and inspectors? NEWMOA recommends that EPA \naddress these questions in the final rule.  \n9. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has \npreviously investigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and \n5 \n draining device through EPA\u2019s Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) \nprogram. The ETV review demonstrated one type of drum -top puncturing and \ndraining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of \nvolatile of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 \n750 cans recommended by some manufacturers. The drum that cont ained the \ndrained liquid from the aerosol cans was also never more than 25% full before \nbreakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary to manufacturer \nrecommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthroug h\u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated \ncompounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal \nand gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of \npuncturing a nd draining devices currently available on the market (one Vermont \nsolid waste district manager stated that they have examined devices ranging in \ncost from $700 to $16,000), the only certain ways to ensure that puncturing and \ndraining activities are contai ning emissions are to either implement an air \nmonitoring program with recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices \nused are equipped with \u201cend of life\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is \noccurring.  \n10. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The pre amble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on establishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining \ndevices and limits on aerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that \nmay be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA sug gests adding language to clarify that once a can has been \npunctured, neither the can nor the collected contents remain universal waste. The \nhandler has generated at least two distinct waste streams and must make accurate \nhazardous waste determinations on b oth. Moreover, if the contents from different \ntypes of cans are mixed in the same collection container, a more complicated \ndetermination will result. And since the contents of various types of containers are \nlikely to be combined, the ultimate waste determ ination is more likely  to be \ninaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must \nbe conducted using a commercial device, this language does not carry through to \nthe definition. If  not specifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d \ndevices which would not have the instructions, recommendations, safety testing, \nand testing on emissions capture that NEWMOA believes are necessary to protect \nhuman health and the environment. As such, NEWMOA recommends revising the \nproposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct puncturing and draining activities using \na commercially -manufactured  device specifically designed to safely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents an d any emissions \nthereof.\u201d  \n6 \n \u2022 Finally, NEWMOA recommends requiring that a maintenance record be kept to \ndocument maintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for \nbreakthrough (that, at a minimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecomme ndations). NEWMOA also recommends that a record be kept \ndocumenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to demonstrate that \nincompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n11. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not \ncommercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from \nother entities in exchange for compensation).\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA recomme nds that the term \u201ccommercial processors\u201d be defined in the \nfinal rule. Based on the parenthetical statement, it is not clear how one \ndistinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from any handler who punctures/drains \naerosol cans since most handlers are compensa ted for receiving (and managing) \nuniversal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercial processers\u201d may be \nmanaging larger quantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they are more \nlikely to be using more sophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than \ngenerators, SQHs or even LQHs, especially if the commercial processor is a \npermitted TSDF. Such processors are also more experienced with and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limits of that equipment. L arger processors \nare also more likely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans \nand which of those materials are incompatible and which materials may have an \nadverse impact on the seals/gaskets of puncturing/draining equipment.  \n\u2022 It shoul d be clear that generators may continue to puncture and drain their own \non-site generated aerosol cans under 40 CFR 262 as generator treatment in a tank \nor container.  \n\u2022 It should be clear that a destination facility can puncture and drain aerosol cans \nreceiv ed from off -site if it\u2019s a recycling facility that doesn\u2019t store (number of days \nneed to be determined, see comment 1).  \n\u2022 It is NEWMOA\u2019s understanding that, as currently proposed, SQHs and LQHs can \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site if th ey do not accept \ncompensation for their services. What is EPA\u2019s logic for allowing SQHs and \nLQHs to puncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site while not being \nsubject to regulation as a destination facility? NEWMOA encourages EPA to \nrequire tha t aerosol cans received from other entities only be punctured and \ndrained at destination facilities.  \n\u2022 Since the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d is neither defined nor used in the proposed \nrule, is it EPA\u2019s intent to regulate facilities that accept compensation for aerosol \ncans received from off -site for puncturing and draining as destination facilities \n7 \n only?  Is compensation the only difference between allowing SQHs and LQHs to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site versus a destination \nfacility?    \n\u2022 NEWMOA would encourage EPA to require that destination facilities vent to an \nair pollution control device that discharges to the atmosphere.   \n12. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(1)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(1). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol can s must be accumulated in a container that is \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol cans and lacks \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably \nforeseeable conditions.\u201d  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may c ontain a wide array of products, NEWMOA believes the \naccumulation requirements for SQHs and LQHs should be revised to specify that \nwaste aerosol cans containing incompatible materials should not be accumulated \nin the same container.  \n13. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3 )/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cA (small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must \nrecycle the empty punctured aerosol cans\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 It should be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally avail able. If \nrecycling is not available in an area, does that mean that puncturing/draining of \naerosol cans is not an option in that location? There needs to be further discussion \nof this requirement in the preamble of the final rule.  \n14. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(ii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) \nuniversal waste aerosol can (including proper assembly, operation and maintenance \nof the unit, segr egation of incompatible wastes, and proper waste management \npractices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 Not only should EPA establish a written procedure, NEWMOA recommends \nadding the words \u201cand follow\u201d so the revised requirement would read: \u201cEstablish \nand follow  a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also recommends revising this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely \npuncture and remove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensure \nthe capture and containment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the \ncompatibility of the contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining \nequipment. In addition, NEWMOA believes that EPA should prohibit the \ncomingling of incompatible liquids when puncturing aerosol cans.  \n8 \n \n15. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(iii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEnsu re that puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires \nand to prevent the release of any component of universal waste to the environment. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on a solid, flat surface in \na well venti lated area.\u201d  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to puncture aerosol \ncans provided they \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission \nthereof.\u201d  This implies that all hazardous waste gases will be collected or captured \nduring the activity. If so, why must puncturing equipment be located in a well -\nventilated area? NEWMOA requests that EPA clarify this point in the final rule.  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also encourages EPA to require that puncturing and draining \nequipment be vented to an air po llution control device that discharges to the \natmosphere.  \nNEWMOA is a non -profit, non -partisan interstate association that was established by the \ngovernors of the New England states as an official interstate regional organization, in accordance \nwith Sectio n 1005 of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), to \ncoordinate in interstate hazardous and solid waste activities.

Some of \nthe members plan to submit additional commen ts.   \nOverall Comment:  NEWMOA\u2019s members generally support the concept of adding \naerosol cans to the universal waste rule. Our members believe that the universal waste \nregulatory framework is appropriate for the collection and management of hazardous \nwaste aerosol cans.  \n \nThe States of Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode \nIsland, and Vermont offer the following comments and recommendations to improve and \nclarify this proposed rule for EPA\u2019s consideration.  \n \n1. Request: Destination faci lities that recycle universal waste and that do not store \nthat universal waste prior to recycling in accordance with 40 CFR 261.6(c)(2) \nmay be exempt from permitting under federal regulations. NEWMOA \nrecommends that EPA provide guidance on the period of ti me that a destination \nfacility may stage aerosol cans before a RCRA storage permit would be federally \nrequired.  \n2. Page 11655, 3rd column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cNote that the \nexpected cost savings is based on the assumption  that all eligible states would \nadopt regulatory changes, once they are finalized. EPA requests comment on \nthis assumption.\u201d  \n \n2 \n \u2022 Given that the rule is optional, it is unlikely that all eligible states will adopt it. Perhaps \nEPA should determine the percentage of states that have adopted other optional universal \nwaste regulations to obtain a more realistic estimate of the economic impact of the \nproposed rule.  \n3. Page 11656, 1st column, last paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cHowever, when \naerosol cans are mismanaged, particularly when exposed to excessive heat, the \nresulting increase in internal pressure can reach a point beyond the design strength \nof the can, thereby causing it to burst and release its contents. At the point of \nbursting, the contents of the can have been heated to a temperature and pressure far \nabove ambient environmental conditi ons, causing the contents to rapidly vaporize \nand be forcefully released. One or more of the following may occur when a can \nbursts as a result of over -heating: (1) If the propellant or product are ignitable, the \ncontents of the can may readily catch fire a s they are released and exposed to \natmospheric oxygen, creating a rapidly burning vapor \u2018\u2018fireball\u2019\u2019; (2) the bottom of \nthe can may detach as a result of a manufacturing defect or an external force, \ncausing the upper part of the can to become a projectile;  or (3) the can may \nfragment as it bursts, releasing metal shards.\u201d  \n\u2022 EPA should state in its final rule whether these scenarios meet the definition of \nreactivity, and aerosol cans should, therefore, be considered reactive under normal \nconditions or only whe n mismanaged.

The preamble states: \u201cEPA requests \ncomment on whether to include a size limit of twenty -four ounces or other type of \nlimitations on the types of aerosol cans that would be eligible for the federal \nuniversal waste rule, including any information on how such a limit would be \nnecessary to ensure safe management of aerosol cans. EPA also requests comment \non the appropriate scope of the definition of \u2018\u2018aerosol can\u2019\u2019 and the ty pes of \nmaterials that should fall under it.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA supports a size limit, and either a 24 ounce or 1 -liter limit would be \nappropriate, in our opinion. The 49 CFR 172.101 Hazardous Material Table \nidentifies five categories of aerosol cans, and for each cat egory, specifies \u201ceach \nnot exceeding 1 L capacity .\u201d While \u201ctypical\u201d aerosol cans are not large, any size \ncould fall within the proposed definition. An example of such product containers \nare the large spray foam containers (generally 2 - to 4-gallon capacity) that may be \npurchased from home improvement stores; according to a Vermont solid waste \ndistrict manager, these containers are extremely expensive to dispose of due to \ntheir CFC content (approximately $375 per container disposal cost).  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also  strongly encourages adding language to the final rule to limit \napplicability to \u201cmanufactured\u201d aerosol cans. A quick internet search produces \nvideos of \u201chomemade\u201d aerosol cans as well as hand -pump pesticide applicators, \nwhich both meet the proposed defini tion.  \n\u2022 A revised definition might state: \u201c\u2026means an intact container, that is a \nmanufactured product not to exceed 1 L capacity, in which gas under pressure is \nused to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or \nfoam.\u201d  \n8. Page 1 1661, first column, 3rd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is proposing \nthat puncturing and draining activities must be conducted by a commercial device \nspecifically designed to safely puncture aerosol cans and effectively contain the \nresidual contents a nd any emissions thereof.\u201d  \n\u2022 What does \u201ceffectively contain\u201d mean with respect to emissions, and how is that \nto be evaluated by handlers and inspectors? NEWMOA recommends that EPA \naddress these questions in the final rule.  \n9. Page 11661, second column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states:  \u201c\u2026the Agency has \npreviously investigated the performance of at least one aerosol can puncturing and \n5 \n draining device through EPA\u2019s Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) \nprogram. The ETV review demonstrated one type of drum -top puncturing and \ndraining system was effective in processing at least 187 cans before breakthrough of \nvolatile of volatile chemicals occurred, which was significantly less than the 600 \u2013 \n750 cans recommended by some manufacturers. The drum that cont ained the \ndrained liquid from the aerosol cans was also never more than 25% full before \nbreakthrough occurring. These findings were contrary to manufacturer \nrecommendations of ensuring the container is not filled past 70% full in order to \navoid breakthroug h\u2026 In addition, the ETV program found that halogenated \ncompounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents) were found to be incompatible with the seal \nand gasket materials.\u201d  \n\u2022 Based on this discussion, as well as anecdotal information about the wide range of \npuncturing a nd draining devices currently available on the market (one Vermont \nsolid waste district manager stated that they have examined devices ranging in \ncost from $700 to $16,000), the only certain ways to ensure that puncturing and \ndraining activities are contai ning emissions are to either implement an air \nmonitoring program with recordkeeping requirements or ensure that the devices \nused are equipped with \u201cend of life\u201d filters that show when breakthrough is \noccurring.  \n10. Page 11661, last column and sentence. The pre amble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on establishing additional regulatory requirements for can draining \ndevices and limits on aerosol cans that may pose compatibility problems and that \nmay be punctured and drained under the proposed rules.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA sug gests adding language to clarify that once a can has been \npunctured, neither the can nor the collected contents remain universal waste. The \nhandler has generated at least two distinct waste streams and must make accurate \nhazardous waste determinations on b oth. Moreover, if the contents from different \ntypes of cans are mixed in the same collection container, a more complicated \ndetermination will result. And since the contents of various types of containers are \nlikely to be combined, the ultimate waste determ ination is more likely  to be \ninaccurate unless EPA emphasizes this point.    \n\u2022 In the preamble, while EPA proposes that puncturing and draining activities must \nbe conducted using a commercial device, this language does not carry through to \nthe definition. If  not specifically stated, this opens the door to \u201chomemade\u201d \ndevices which would not have the instructions, recommendations, safety testing, \nand testing on emissions capture that NEWMOA believes are necessary to protect \nhuman health and the environment. As such, NEWMOA recommends revising the \nproposed definition as follows: \u201cConduct puncturing and draining activities using \na commercially -manufactured  device specifically designed to safely puncture \naerosol cans and effectively contain the residual contents an d any emissions \nthereof.\u201d  \n6 \n \u2022 Finally, NEWMOA recommends requiring that a maintenance record be kept to \ndocument maintenance activity (including filter changes) and monitoring for \nbreakthrough (that, at a minimum, are consistent with the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecomme ndations). NEWMOA also recommends that a record be kept \ndocumenting the contents of punctured/drained cans to demonstrate that \nincompatibles have not been mixed and to help facilitate proper waste \ndeterminations.  \n11. Page 11662, 1st column, 2nd paragraph. The preamble states: \u201cEPA is requesting \ncomment on limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not \ncommercial processors (i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from \nother entities in exchange for compensation).\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA recomme nds that the term \u201ccommercial processors\u201d be defined in the \nfinal rule. Based on the parenthetical statement, it is not clear how one \ndistinguishes a \u201ccommercial processor\u201d from any handler who punctures/drains \naerosol cans since most handlers are compensa ted for receiving (and managing) \nuniversal wastes from other entities.  \n\u2022 It should also be noted that while large scale \u201ccommercial processers\u201d may be \nmanaging larger quantities of cans and a wider variety of materials, they are more \nlikely to be using more sophisticated puncturing/draining equipment than \ngenerators, SQHs or even LQHs, especially if the commercial processor is a \npermitted TSDF. Such processors are also more experienced with and \nknowledgeable about the abilities and limits of that equipment. L arger processors \nare also more likely to be familiar with the universe of materials in aerosol cans \nand which of those materials are incompatible and which materials may have an \nadverse impact on the seals/gaskets of puncturing/draining equipment.  \n\u2022 It shoul d be clear that generators may continue to puncture and drain their own \non-site generated aerosol cans under 40 CFR 262 as generator treatment in a tank \nor container.  \n\u2022 It should be clear that a destination facility can puncture and drain aerosol cans \nreceiv ed from off -site if it\u2019s a recycling facility that doesn\u2019t store (number of days \nneed to be determined, see comment 1).  \n\u2022 It is NEWMOA\u2019s understanding that, as currently proposed, SQHs and LQHs can \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site if th ey do not accept \ncompensation for their services. What is EPA\u2019s logic for allowing SQHs and \nLQHs to puncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site while not being \nsubject to regulation as a destination facility? NEWMOA encourages EPA to \nrequire tha t aerosol cans received from other entities only be punctured and \ndrained at destination facilities.  \n\u2022 Since the term \u201ccommercial processor\u201d is neither defined nor used in the proposed \nrule, is it EPA\u2019s intent to regulate facilities that accept compensation for aerosol \ncans received from off -site for puncturing and draining as destination facilities \n7 \n only?  Is compensation the only difference between allowing SQHs and LQHs to \npuncture and drain aerosol cans received from off -site versus a destination \nfacility?    \n\u2022 NEWMOA would encourage EPA to require that destination facilities vent to an \nair pollution control device that discharges to the atmosphere.   \n12. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(1)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(1). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cUniversal waste aerosol can s must be accumulated in a container that is \nstructurally sound, compatible with the contents of the aerosol cans and lacks \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under reasonably \nforeseeable conditions.\u201d  \n\u2022 Since aerosol cans may c ontain a wide array of products, NEWMOA believes the \naccumulation requirements for SQHs and LQHs should be revised to specify that \nwaste aerosol cans containing incompatible materials should not be accumulated \nin the same container.  \n13. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3 )/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3). The proposed regulations state: \n\u201cA (small/large) quantity handler who punctures and drains their aerosol cans must \nrecycle the empty punctured aerosol cans\u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 It should be noted that scrap metal recycling is not universally avail able. If \nrecycling is not available in an area, does that mean that puncturing/draining of \naerosol cans is not an option in that location? There needs to be further discussion \nof this requirement in the preamble of the final rule.  \n14. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(ii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(ii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEstablish a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain (a) \nuniversal waste aerosol can (including proper assembly, operation and maintenance \nof the unit, segr egation of incompatible wastes, and proper waste management \npractices to prevent fires or releases) \u2026\u201d  \n\u2022 Not only should EPA establish a written procedure, NEWMOA recommends \nadding the words \u201cand follow\u201d so the revised requirement would read: \u201cEstablish \nand follow  a written procedure detailing how to safely puncture\u2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also recommends revising this requirement as follows: \u201c\u2026safely \npuncture and remove the contents from universal waste aerosol cans and ensure \nthe capture and containment of all resulting liquid and gaseous waste materials. \u201d \n\u2022 The rule should also require that the written procedure address prevention of filter \nbreakthrough, ensuring compatibility of commingled liquids, and ensuring the \ncompatibility of the contents of punctured cans with the puncturing and draining \nequipment. In addition, NEWMOA believes that EPA should prohibit the \ncomingling of incompatible liquids when puncturing aerosol cans.  \n8 \n \n15. Page 11666, 273.13(e)(3)(iii)/Page 11667, 273.33(e)(3)(iii). The proposed regulations \nstate: \u201cEnsu re that puncturing of the cans is in a manner designed to prevent fires \nand to prevent the release of any component of universal waste to the environment. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, locating the equipment on a solid, flat surface in \na well venti lated area.\u201d  \n\u2022 The proposed regulation 273.13/33 (e)(3) allows handlers to puncture aerosol \ncans provided they \u201ceffectively contain the residual contents and any emission \nthereof.\u201d  This implies that all hazardous waste gases will be collected or captured \nduring the activity. If so, why must puncturing equipment be located in a well -\nventilated area? NEWMOA requests that EPA clarify this point in the final rule.  \n\u2022 NEWMOA also encourages EPA to require that puncturing and draining \nequipment be vented to an air po llution control device that discharges to the \natmosphere.  \nNEWMOA is a non -profit, non -partisan interstate association that was established by the \ngovernors of the New England states as an official interstate regional organization, in accordance \nwith Sectio n 1005 of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), to \ncoordinate in interstate hazardous and solid waste activities.

Reg. 11654 (March 16, 2018).  \n The ETC is the leading trade association of commercial firms th at provide \ntechnologies and services to customers for the recycling, treatment, and secure disposal \nof industrial and hazardous wastes.  ETC member companies own and operate a wide \nvariety of commercial operations, including spent solvent distillation, oil  recovery \nfacilities, metals reclamation units, mercury recovery from fluorescent lamps, \nphotographic chemical and film recovery facilities, wastewater treatment plants, \ncollection and transfer stations, secure landfills, high-temperature incinerators, ind ustrial \nfurnaces  and a variety of other types of facilities for the management of industrial and \nhazardous wastes.    \n In general, ETC supports the Agency\u2019s proposed rule to add aerosol cans to the \nUniversal Waste Regulations.  Currently, under the Resource  Conservation and Recovery \nAct (RCRA) aerosol cans are often categorized as hazardous waste and must be managed \nby a permitted RCRA hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF).  \nThe contents (i.e. propellants) within aerosol cans may be  flammable, the product may \ncontain solvents, metals and toxic organics and therefore these cans may have a negative \nimpact on human health and the environment and thus must be disposed of properly.  \nLike other Universal Waste (i.e. batteries and bulbs), a erosol cans are generated by a \nwide variety of waste generators.  Classification as Universal Waste would allow and \nencourage collection by Universal Waste handlers including retail establishments.  This \nwill help promote environmentally sound management f or aerosols that are not currently \nregulated by RCRA, such as those generated by homeowners and Very Small Quantity \nGenerators.  The Agency correctly notes that absent government intervention, facilities \nthat generate waste aerosol cans would likely send t hem to municipal solid waste landfills \nwhich generally are less protective of human health and the environment than disposal at \n 2 TSDFs.  Again, while we generally support the Agency\u2019s proposed rule, there are several \nareas listed below we believe the Agency  must address and consider making changes.   \nDefinition of Aerosol Cans   \n EPA defines an aerosol can as an intact container in which gas under pressure is \nused to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam.  \nETC recomme nds expanding the definition to include the phrase \u201cany non -refillable\u201d to \nmake it consistent with the U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials \nRegulations 49 CFR 171.8.  Under this regulation an aerosol is defined as \u201cany non -\nrefillable  recep tacle containing a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, \nthe sole purpose of which is to expel a nonpoisonous (other than a Division 6.1 Packing \nGroup III material) liquid, paste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device \nallowing the contents to be ejected by the gas.\" By adding the phrase \u201cany non -refillable\u201d \nEPA\u2019s definition would read as follows: Any non -refillable intact container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in t he form of \na spray or foam.  By adding this phrase it makes it very clear as to what the Agency \ndefines as an aerosol can for purposes of the Universal Waste program.  \n Additionally, it would serve the Agency well to clarify the term \u201cintact.\u201d  As written, the \nterm could be narrowly interpreted thus rendering an aerosol can as not being intact if it \nis simply missing an actuator. After the word intact, the Agency should add \u201cdoes not \nshow evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage.\u201d  Th is would be \nconsistent with the description of ineligible aerosol cans in Sec. 273.6(b)(4).       \nGenerators Must Properly Characterize Their Hazardous Aerosol Cans  \n While handlers who manage items designated as Universal Waste are subject to \nthe managemen t standards in 40 CFR part 273, a TSDF performing disposal of these \nUniversal Wastes is subject to the full RCRA subtitle C regulations.  Due to the diversity \nof the materials that may be present in waste aerosol cans, ETC recommends that when \nthis Univers al Waste is sent to a TSDF disposal facility such as an incinerator, the \ngenerator and/or handler who collects the cans be required to provide the disposal facility \n(i.e. an incinerator or processing facility) with information about the contents of the can s, \nincluding what constituents must be treated in order to demonstrate compliance with the \nLand Disposal Restriction (LDR) standards.  This provides continuity from the generator \nand his waste characterization responsibilities through to the disposal facil ity where \ntreatment/disposal is subject to the RCRA LDRs.  This will also ensure that the \ngenerator\u2019s cradle to grave management responsibilities are being conducted in \naccordance with RCRA: the generator determines his waste aerosol cans qualify as \nhazard ous waste, he chooses the more flexible accumulation option of Universal Waste, \nships his aerosols to a Universal Waste handler for consolidation, the aerosols are shipped \n 3 to a disposal facility where they re -enter the full RCRA program and are treated in \ncomplia nce with the LDR standards.  \nEPA\u2019s Should Regulate Handlers and Destination Facilities The Same  \n \n The preamble of the proposed rule states that EPA has interpreted the current \nhazardous waste regulations to mean that puncturing and draining an aeroso l can, if \nperformed by a generator for the purpose of recycling (i.e. for scrap metal recycling), is \nconsidered part of the recycling process and is exempt from RCRA permitting \nrequirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).  However, facilities receiving hazardous wa ste \naerosol cans from off -site would require a RCRA permit for storage if stored prior to the \nrecycling activity, and the recycling process would be subject to subparts AA and BB of \n40 CFR part 264, 265, or 267.  Under the universal waste rule, destination  facilities are \nthose facilities that treat, store, dispose or recycle Universal Wastes.  The Agency needs \nto realize that all destination facilities that receive Universal Waste for the sole purpose \nof recycling should be exempted from RCRA permitting req uirements for this activity \nunder 40 CFR 261.6(c).  Recycling should be the focus; the location where the process \ntakes place should not matter. There should be no double standards for Universal Waste \nhandlers and TSDF facilities if the sole purpose is the  recycling of Universal Waste.  All \nTSDF facilities that receive Universal Waste for recycling should be treated as Universal \nWaste handlers and thus not be subject to subparts AA and BB of 40 CFR part 264, 265 \nor 267.  \nCommercial Devices  \n The Agency invest igated the performance of only one aerosol can puncturing and \ndraining device through its Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The \nETV review demonstrated that this type of drum -top system was effective in processing \nonly 187 cans before br eakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred, which was \nsignificantly less than the 600 \u2013750 cans estimated by manufacturers. The drum that \ncontained the drained liquid from the aerosol cans was also never more than 25% full \nbefore breakthrough occurred , which  was inconsistent with the  manufacturer \nrecommendations that the container could reach  70% full before breakthrough . In \naddition, the ETV program found that halogenated compounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents) \nwere incompatible with the seal and gasket mater ials.  Despite the Agency\u2019s admission \nthat the one investigation that was conducted resulted in a negative outcome with \npremature breakthrough  of volatile chemicals, EPA is still proposing that recyclers must \nuse a \u201ccommercial device \u201d specifically designed  to safely puncture aerosol cans and \neffectively contain the residual cont ents and any emissions thereof.  \n In light of the outcome of the ETV investigation, there is no record basis for EPA  \nprescribing one particular method for puncturing and draining aero sol cans using only a \n 4 so-called \u201ccommercial device.\u201d  Many ETC companies have designed and operate their \nown equipment for such purposes, based on their engineering expertise in handling \nhazardous wastes.  ETC believes the emphasis should be on ensuring th at aerosol cans \nare safely punctured and their contents safely contained.  Whether it is a commercial \ndevice or an engineered system designed in -house should not matter as long as it is \ndesigned and operated in a manner to reasonably meet technical standar ds required for air \nemissions under RCRA.  Moreover, it should  not matter whether the activities are being \nperformed by a TSDF or a handler , the required standards must be the same.  \nPuncturing and Draining Aerosol Cans  \n \n The Agency is proposing that punct uring and draining -recycling practices without \na RCRA permit be limited to Universal Waste handlers that are not TSDFs (commercial \nprocessors).  Under this option , handlers that are TSDFs may still accept aerosol cans for \nsorting and consolidation , but the y would not be able  to puncture and drain the cans.  To \ndo so, TSDFs must first meet the requirements for a Universal Waste destination facility , \nwhich requires  a RCRA  permit for storage  and compliance with Subpart AA and BB \nstandards . ETC does not support  this unequal approach .  Generators (i.e. Universal Waste \nhandlers) are likely less equipped or adequately trained to recycle aerosol cans than \nTSDF s.  In fact , the risk of mismanagement, spill s or air release s is greater for a universal \nwaste handler who may not have the level of expertise of a company that specializes in \nhazardous waste management.  Aerosol cans frequently contain flammable propellants \nsuch as propane or butane which can cause the aerosol can to demonstrate the hazardous \ncharacteristic fo r ignitability . \n In addition, aerosol cans may also be hazardous waste for numerous other \ncharacteristics when discarded.  ETC has serious concerns about the qualifications of the \npersonnel and the process es employed when puncturing and draining activities  are \nperformed by non-professionals.  Due to the dangers associated with improper handling \nof aerosol can contents (i.e. fire risk, potential air emissions, and need to properly \ncharacterize the liquid collected from draining the cans), ETC recommends that  the \npractice of puncturing and draining aerosol cans not be performed  only by Universal \nWaste handlers, but instead be performed by TSDFs.  \nManagement Requirements for Universal Waste Handlers  \n \n The proposed rule indicates that small quantity handlers of U niversal Waste and \nlarge quantity handlers must manage their Universal Waste aerosol cans in a manner \ndesigned to prevent releases to the environment. This includes accumulating Universal \nWaste aerosol cans in containers that are structurally sound and com patible with the \ncontents of the can, and show no evidence of leaks, spills, or damage that could cause \nleaks under reasonably foreseeable conditions.  Based on some of the experiences of the \n 5 ETC membership, we recommend EPA propose additional packaging re quirements such \nas requiring aerosol cans be packaged with strong outer packaging (not necessarily UN \nspecification packaging), that compatibility must be considered when the cans are \ncollected in containers and the cans must have protective caps in place or have val ve \nstems removed or other packaging techniques employed to prevent accidental discharge.  \nWe believe these requirements would help to prevent d rums from becoming pressurized \ndue to aerosol propellants escaping or the can\u2019s contents being confine d in a closed drum \nleading to a forceful and dangerous pressure release (i.e. drum lid blown off).  The \nregulation should mention that containers must be properly labeled in accordance with \nDOT hazard class and proper DOT shipping description.  \nOther Manage ment Requirements for UW Handlers  \n \n EPA is proposing that Universal Waste handlers must establish a written \nprocedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain universal waste aerosol cans \n(including operation and maintenance of the unit; segregation of i ncompatible wastes; \nand proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases) and ensure \nemployees operating the devices are trained in the proper procedures.  ETC supports this \nproposal; however , our recommendation is that the practice of punctu ring and draining \naerosol cans should not be performed by Universal Waste handlers, but instead be \nperformed by TSDFs (commercial processors) who have a greater level of expertise in \nperforming such operations.  \n EPA is proposing that the contents from the cans or puncturing device be \nimmediately transferred to a container or tank and that the contents are subject to a \nhazardous waste determination under 40 CFR 262.11.  ETC supports this proposal. The \nproposed rule would also require that a written procedure  be in place in the event of a \nspill or release and a spill clean -up kit be readily available.  ETC supports this proposal.    \n Thank you for the opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s proposed rule.  The ETC \nlooks forward to working with you on developing and im plementing this proposal.  If you \nhave any questions, please feel free to contact me at 202 -731-1815 or via e -mail at \njwilliams@etc.org . \n      Sincerely,            \n     \n  \n      James A.

Currently, under the Resource  Conservation and Recovery \nAct (RCRA) aerosol cans are often categorized as hazardous waste and must be managed \nby a permitted RCRA hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility (TSDF).  \nThe contents (i.e. propellants) within aerosol cans may be  flammable, the product may \ncontain solvents, metals and toxic organics and therefore these cans may have a negative \nimpact on human health and the environment and thus must be disposed of properly.  \nLike other Universal Waste (i.e. batteries and bulbs), a erosol cans are generated by a \nwide variety of waste generators.  Classification as Universal Waste would allow and \nencourage collection by Universal Waste handlers including retail establishments.  This \nwill help promote environmentally sound management f or aerosols that are not currently \nregulated by RCRA, such as those generated by homeowners and Very Small Quantity \nGenerators.  The Agency correctly notes that absent government intervention, facilities \nthat generate waste aerosol cans would likely send t hem to municipal solid waste landfills \nwhich generally are less protective of human health and the environment than disposal at \n 2 TSDFs.  Again, while we generally support the Agency\u2019s proposed rule, there are several \nareas listed below we believe the Agency  must address and consider making changes.   \nDefinition of Aerosol Cans   \n EPA defines an aerosol can as an intact container in which gas under pressure is \nused to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam.  \nETC recomme nds expanding the definition to include the phrase \u201cany non -refillable\u201d to \nmake it consistent with the U.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials \nRegulations 49 CFR 171.8.  Under this regulation an aerosol is defined as \u201cany non -\nrefillable  recep tacle containing a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under pressure, \nthe sole purpose of which is to expel a nonpoisonous (other than a Division 6.1 Packing \nGroup III material) liquid, paste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device \nallowing the contents to be ejected by the gas.\" By adding the phrase \u201cany non -refillable\u201d \nEPA\u2019s definition would read as follows: Any non -refillable intact container in which gas \nunder pressure is used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in t he form of \na spray or foam.  By adding this phrase it makes it very clear as to what the Agency \ndefines as an aerosol can for purposes of the Universal Waste program.  \n Additionally, it would serve the Agency well to clarify the term \u201cintact.\u201d  As written, the \nterm could be narrowly interpreted thus rendering an aerosol can as not being intact if it \nis simply missing an actuator. After the word intact, the Agency should add \u201cdoes not \nshow evidence of leakage, spillage or damage that could cause leakage.\u201d  Th is would be \nconsistent with the description of ineligible aerosol cans in Sec. 273.6(b)(4).       \nGenerators Must Properly Characterize Their Hazardous Aerosol Cans  \n While handlers who manage items designated as Universal Waste are subject to \nthe managemen t standards in 40 CFR part 273, a TSDF performing disposal of these \nUniversal Wastes is subject to the full RCRA subtitle C regulations.  Due to the diversity \nof the materials that may be present in waste aerosol cans, ETC recommends that when \nthis Univers al Waste is sent to a TSDF disposal facility such as an incinerator, the \ngenerator and/or handler who collects the cans be required to provide the disposal facility \n(i.e. an incinerator or processing facility) with information about the contents of the can s, \nincluding what constituents must be treated in order to demonstrate compliance with the \nLand Disposal Restriction (LDR) standards.  This provides continuity from the generator \nand his waste characterization responsibilities through to the disposal facil ity where \ntreatment/disposal is subject to the RCRA LDRs.  This will also ensure that the \ngenerator\u2019s cradle to grave management responsibilities are being conducted in \naccordance with RCRA: the generator determines his waste aerosol cans qualify as \nhazard ous waste, he chooses the more flexible accumulation option of Universal Waste, \nships his aerosols to a Universal Waste handler for consolidation, the aerosols are shipped \n 3 to a disposal facility where they re -enter the full RCRA program and are treated in \ncomplia nce with the LDR standards.  \nEPA\u2019s Should Regulate Handlers and Destination Facilities The Same  \n \n The preamble of the proposed rule states that EPA has interpreted the current \nhazardous waste regulations to mean that puncturing and draining an aeroso l can, if \nperformed by a generator for the purpose of recycling (i.e. for scrap metal recycling), is \nconsidered part of the recycling process and is exempt from RCRA permitting \nrequirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c).  However, facilities receiving hazardous wa ste \naerosol cans from off -site would require a RCRA permit for storage if stored prior to the \nrecycling activity, and the recycling process would be subject to subparts AA and BB of \n40 CFR part 264, 265, or 267.  Under the universal waste rule, destination  facilities are \nthose facilities that treat, store, dispose or recycle Universal Wastes.  The Agency needs \nto realize that all destination facilities that receive Universal Waste for the sole purpose \nof recycling should be exempted from RCRA permitting req uirements for this activity \nunder 40 CFR 261.6(c).  Recycling should be the focus; the location where the process \ntakes place should not matter. There should be no double standards for Universal Waste \nhandlers and TSDF facilities if the sole purpose is the  recycling of Universal Waste.  All \nTSDF facilities that receive Universal Waste for recycling should be treated as Universal \nWaste handlers and thus not be subject to subparts AA and BB of 40 CFR part 264, 265 \nor 267.  \nCommercial Devices  \n The Agency invest igated the performance of only one aerosol can puncturing and \ndraining device through its Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program. The \nETV review demonstrated that this type of drum -top system was effective in processing \nonly 187 cans before br eakthrough of volatile chemicals occurred, which was \nsignificantly less than the 600 \u2013750 cans estimated by manufacturers. The drum that \ncontained the drained liquid from the aerosol cans was also never more than 25% full \nbefore breakthrough occurred , which  was inconsistent with the  manufacturer \nrecommendations that the container could reach  70% full before breakthrough . In \naddition, the ETV program found that halogenated compounds (e.g., chlorinated solvents) \nwere incompatible with the seal and gasket mater ials.  Despite the Agency\u2019s admission \nthat the one investigation that was conducted resulted in a negative outcome with \npremature breakthrough  of volatile chemicals, EPA is still proposing that recyclers must \nuse a \u201ccommercial device \u201d specifically designed  to safely puncture aerosol cans and \neffectively contain the residual cont ents and any emissions thereof.  \n In light of the outcome of the ETV investigation, there is no record basis for EPA  \nprescribing one particular method for puncturing and draining aero sol cans using only a \n 4 so-called \u201ccommercial device.\u201d  Many ETC companies have designed and operate their \nown equipment for such purposes, based on their engineering expertise in handling \nhazardous wastes.  ETC believes the emphasis should be on ensuring th at aerosol cans \nare safely punctured and their contents safely contained.  Whether it is a commercial \ndevice or an engineered system designed in -house should not matter as long as it is \ndesigned and operated in a manner to reasonably meet technical standar ds required for air \nemissions under RCRA.  Moreover, it should  not matter whether the activities are being \nperformed by a TSDF or a handler , the required standards must be the same.  \nPuncturing and Draining Aerosol Cans  \n \n The Agency is proposing that punct uring and draining -recycling practices without \na RCRA permit be limited to Universal Waste handlers that are not TSDFs (commercial \nprocessors).  Under this option , handlers that are TSDFs may still accept aerosol cans for \nsorting and consolidation , but the y would not be able  to puncture and drain the cans.  To \ndo so, TSDFs must first meet the requirements for a Universal Waste destination facility , \nwhich requires  a RCRA  permit for storage  and compliance with Subpart AA and BB \nstandards . ETC does not support  this unequal approach .  Generators (i.e. Universal Waste \nhandlers) are likely less equipped or adequately trained to recycle aerosol cans than \nTSDF s.  In fact , the risk of mismanagement, spill s or air release s is greater for a universal \nwaste handler who may not have the level of expertise of a company that specializes in \nhazardous waste management.  Aerosol cans frequently contain flammable propellants \nsuch as propane or butane which can cause the aerosol can to demonstrate the hazardous \ncharacteristic fo r ignitability . \n In addition, aerosol cans may also be hazardous waste for numerous other \ncharacteristics when discarded.  ETC has serious concerns about the qualifications of the \npersonnel and the process es employed when puncturing and draining activities  are \nperformed by non-professionals.  Due to the dangers associated with improper handling \nof aerosol can contents (i.e. fire risk, potential air emissions, and need to properly \ncharacterize the liquid collected from draining the cans), ETC recommends that  the \npractice of puncturing and draining aerosol cans not be performed  only by Universal \nWaste handlers, but instead be performed by TSDFs.  \nManagement Requirements for Universal Waste Handlers  \n \n The proposed rule indicates that small quantity handlers of U niversal Waste and \nlarge quantity handlers must manage their Universal Waste aerosol cans in a manner \ndesigned to prevent releases to the environment. This includes accumulating Universal \nWaste aerosol cans in containers that are structurally sound and com patible with the \ncontents of the can, and show no evidence of leaks, spills, or damage that could cause \nleaks under reasonably foreseeable conditions.  Based on some of the experiences of the \n 5 ETC membership, we recommend EPA propose additional packaging re quirements such \nas requiring aerosol cans be packaged with strong outer packaging (not necessarily UN \nspecification packaging), that compatibility must be considered when the cans are \ncollected in containers and the cans must have protective caps in place or have val ve \nstems removed or other packaging techniques employed to prevent accidental discharge.  \nWe believe these requirements would help to prevent d rums from becoming pressurized \ndue to aerosol propellants escaping or the can\u2019s contents being confine d in a closed drum \nleading to a forceful and dangerous pressure release (i.e. drum lid blown off).  The \nregulation should mention that containers must be properly labeled in accordance with \nDOT hazard class and proper DOT shipping description.  \nOther Manage ment Requirements for UW Handlers  \n \n EPA is proposing that Universal Waste handlers must establish a written \nprocedure detailing how to safely puncture and drain universal waste aerosol cans \n(including operation and maintenance of the unit; segregation of i ncompatible wastes; \nand proper waste management practices to prevent fires or releases) and ensure \nemployees operating the devices are trained in the proper procedures.  ETC supports this \nproposal; however , our recommendation is that the practice of punctu ring and draining \naerosol cans should not be performed by Universal Waste handlers, but instead be \nperformed by TSDFs (commercial processors) who have a greater level of expertise in \nperforming such operations.  \n EPA is proposing that the contents from the cans or puncturing device be \nimmediately transferred to a container or tank and that the contents are subject to a \nhazardous waste determination under 40 CFR 262.11.  ETC supports this proposal. The \nproposed rule would also require that a written procedure  be in place in the event of a \nspill or release and a spill clean -up kit be readily available.  ETC supports this proposal.    \n Thank you for the opportunity to comment on EPA\u2019s proposed rule.  The ETC \nlooks forward to working with you on developing and im plementing this proposal.

The existing universal \nwaste regulations allow universal waste handlers to process universal wastes (i.e., crush fluorescent lamps, \ndisassemble batteries, etc.) as long as the wastes generated from such processing (lamp fragments , battery acid, etc.) \nis managed as hazardous waste. In such cases, the universal waste handler conducting the processing (which is not \nnecessarily the original generator of the universal waste) becomes the generator of the resultant hazardous waste. \nThe proposed regulations, similarly, would allow handlers of universal waste aerosol cans to puncture and drain \naerosol cans and manage the materials removed from those cans as hazardous waste. \nWhile the types of hazardous waste generated during the processing of other types of universal wastes is consistent \nand well known (crushing fluorescent lamps generates mercury-contam inated fragments, disassembling batteries \ngenerates acid and lead-contami nated solids, etc.), the types of hazardous wastes generated from aerosol can \npuncturing is more variable. Such wastes could include a variety of characteristic wastes, listed wastes, or any \ncombination thereof. ADEM is concerned universal waste handlers that receive aerosol cans from other generators \nmay not be able to properly perform an adequate waste determination on the hazardous wastes subsequently \ngenerated , resulting in a greater risk of mis-management. \nIn section IV.B.2. ofthe proposed rulemaking (on page 11662 ofthe March 16,2018 Federal Register) , the EPA \nrequests comment on \"limiting puncturing and draining practices to handlers that are not commercial processors \n(i.e., a person that processes aerosol cans received from other entities in exchange for compensation). \" ADEM \nunderstands that EPA would consider any handler other than the original generator and the destination facility to \nbe a \"commercial processor\".

Reg. 11654 (March 16, 2018).   USWAG is an \nassociation of electric and gas utilities, power producers and affiliated \nassociations and represents its members on, among other issues, the \nmanagement and recycling of solid and haza rdous wastes.  USW AG member\ncompanies regularly generate waste aerosol cans during the generation, \ntransmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas at a wide variety of \nlocations and in various quantities.  Adding aerosol cans to the RCRA unive rsal \nwaste program will directly impact the ma nagement and recycling of aerosol cans \nby our industry.  USWAG generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal which will reduce \nthe management burdens on the recycling and disposal of aerosol cans.  We\n                                                          \n1USW AG, formed in 1978, is an assoc iation of over one hundred and thirty electric \nutilities, power producers ,utility operating companies, and utility service companies \nlocated throughout the United States, including the Edison Electric Institute (\u201cEEI\u201d), the \nAmerican Gas Association (\u201cAGA\u201d ), the American Public Power Association (\u201cAPPA\u201d), \nand the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (\u201cNRECA\u201d). Together, US WAG \nmembers represent more than 73% of the total electric generating capacity of the United \nStates, and service more than 95% of the nation\u2019s consumers of electricity and 92% of \nthe nation\u2019s consumers of natural gas.\n-2 -\n20480658 -v1have concerns , howeve r,that the proposed management standards will limit the \nbenefits that would otherwise accrue from adding aerosol cans to the universal \nwaste program and will unnecessarily imposeregulatory burden son the \nrecycling and disposal of these materials.   \nAsan initial matter, USW AG firmly supports adding waste aerosol cans to \nthe RCRA universal waste program.  We agree that reducing the regulatory \nburdens on aerosol cans that otherwise would be subject to full RCRA hazardous \nwaste regulation will significant ly improve the collection and recycling of these \ncans.  Much like the universal waste program has accomplished for other waste \nstreams, households and very small quantity generators likely will decide either \nto accumulate their own wastes in larger amounts or bring these materials to \ncollection centers which both diverts these wastes from being disposed of in \nmunicipal solid waste landfills and allows for the accumulation of universal \nwastes facilitating recycling. States\u2019 successful experience swith the \nmanagement of aerosol cans as universal waste and the past success of the \nfederal universal waste program forother materials is powerful evidence that \nsimilar benefits will accrue if EPA adds aerosol cans to the federal program.  \nFurthermore, if EPA adds these materials to the universal waste program, \ngenerators that otherwise would be classified as either small or large quantity \ngenerators would be allowed to accumulate larger volumes of these cans forup \nto one year which will significantly facilitate re cycling.   USW AG members \ngenerate aerosol cans at a wide variety of sites ranging from utility manholes to \nlarge power plants.  Providing an option for the accumulation of these wastes a t\ncentral collection points significantly reduces the regulatory burden s associated\nwith managing these disparate but ubiquitous wastes.  As is true for virtually all \nrecycling, the collection of larger volumes of materials reduces the burden on \nmanaging and transporting aerosol cans being recycled .  \nIn the preamble to the p roposed rule, EPA provides a discussion of the \nappropriateness of adding aerosol cans to the federal universal waste program\nand how these materials meet the regulatory criteria established for this program .  \nWhile US WAG agrees with EPA\u2019s assessment of the universal waste regulatory \nfactors , we think that EPA\u2019s analysis does not consider other factors that are \nimportant for evaluating aerosol cans as a candidate for the program.  In \ndifferentiating the relative risk of these cans in comparison with other ha zardous \nwaste, EPA does not consider the fact that the public at large knows about the \nrisks of aerosol cans.  These materials are so ubiquitous that the primary risk of \nthese cans, ignitability, due to the pressurization and contents of these cans can \nbe assumed to be common knowledge.  This fact, above all other \nconsiderations, illustrates that these cans have a lower risk than other hazardous \nwastes .  \n-3 -\n20480658 -v1EPA also does not fully consider the regulatory burdens associated with \nmanaging aerosol cans as hazar dous waste.  Even if aerosol cans aremanaged \nas excluded hazardous waste \u2014for example, excluded scrap metal, these cans \nstill must be subject to the codified legitimacy criteria, which is a significant \nburden on their potential recycling.  Because the univ ersal waste program is not \na hazardous waste exclusion, the legitimacy criteria do not need to be evaluated \nfor aerosol cans being recycled as universal waste.  This factor alone is a \nsignificant benefit to managing aerosol cans as universal waste.  \nNotwi thstanding our general support for the addition of aerosol cans to the \nfederal universal waste program, we have significant concerns that EPA\u2019s \nproposal unnecessarily adds regulatory burdens to the management of these \nmaterials as universal waste.   In the proposal\u2019s preamble, the Agency notes that \ngenerators that punctu reand/or drain waste aerosol cans are exempt from \nRCRA permitting requirements if the activity is part of the recycling process.  83 \nFed. Reg. at 11656.  Nonetheless, EPA intends to codify m anagement standards \nin the current proposal requiring the use of a commercial device with attendant \nwritten procedures on its use, including procedures for spil land release \nresponses for handlers puncturing and draining aerosol cans.  Id.at 11666 -67.  \nWhile we can see the benefit of this requirement for large scale commercial \nentities that handle aerosol cans on behalf of many generators, generators that \nmanage their own aerosol cans should not be subject to this standard.  Forcing \ngenerators to choose be tween managing aerosol cans as fully hazardous waste \nwithout management standards or universal waste subject to management \nstandards will necessarily limit the relief provided by EPA in this rulemaking.  \nSince generators have been safely handling the punct uring and draining of cans \npursuant to the full hazardous waste regulations ,imposing these management \nstandards on purportedly streamlined universal waste standards seems \nunnecessary and counterproductive.  \nUSW AG also supports EPA\u2019s position that the uni versal waste \nmanagement standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal waste.  W hile aerosol cans are assumed \nto be of certain specific dimens ions, adopting this limitation c ould require that all \naerosol cans be weighed individually which would frustrate the streamlined \nmanagement standards.  This would be especially problematic for aerosol cans \ngenerated in the field at remote locations where scales might be inaccessible.  \nCans that did not meet this wei ght restriction would potentially be subject to full \nhazardous waste regulation and when managed together with universal waste \ncans would presumably subject entire loads of materials to full hazardous waste \nregulation.  This type of restriction could frust rate the entire regulatory scheme \nbeing proposed.  \n-4 -\n20480658 -v1In finalizing this regulatory program, USW AG also requests that EPA \nclarify the currently available management standards foraerosol cans that show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could caus e leakage under \nreasonably foreseeable conditions.   In the preamble of the proposal, EPA \nsuggests that these cans \u201cbe subject to full hazardous waste standards\u201d and not \nbe managed pursuant to the universal waste standards being proposed.  Id.at \n11660.  W hile we do not object to the exclusion of these cans from the scope of \nthe proposal, we request that EPA clarify that these cans can still be punctured \nand drained by generators where it is safe to do so.  By puncturing and draining \nthese cans, generators c an and often do eliminate potential leakage and remove \na risk associated with f uture management of these cans.  W e also strongly \nencourage the Agency to address what constitutes leakage from aerosol cans.  \nMany cans can have minor leaks such that the conte nts of the can are visible \noutside of the can.  This can occur even from normal use and often does not \nindicate that the aerosol can\u2019s ability to contain its contents has been \ncompromised.  We urge EPA to clarify that cans with these ordinary \u201cleaks\u201d can \nstill be managed pursuant to the proposed universal waste standards.  \n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\n  We appreciate the opportunity to submit these comments on this \nimportant initiative .

States\u2019 successful experience swith the \nmanagement of aerosol cans as universal waste and the past success of the \nfederal universal waste program forother materials is powerful evidence that \nsimilar benefits will accrue if EPA adds aerosol cans to the federal program.  \nFurthermore, if EPA adds these materials to the universal waste program, \ngenerators that otherwise would be classified as either small or large quantity \ngenerators would be allowed to accumulate larger volumes of these cans forup \nto one year which will significantly facilitate re cycling.   USW AG members \ngenerate aerosol cans at a wide variety of sites ranging from utility manholes to \nlarge power plants.  Providing an option for the accumulation of these wastes a t\ncentral collection points significantly reduces the regulatory burden s associated\nwith managing these disparate but ubiquitous wastes.  As is true for virtually all \nrecycling, the collection of larger volumes of materials reduces the burden on \nmanaging and transporting aerosol cans being recycled .  \nIn the preamble to the p roposed rule, EPA provides a discussion of the \nappropriateness of adding aerosol cans to the federal universal waste program\nand how these materials meet the regulatory criteria established for this program .  \nWhile US WAG agrees with EPA\u2019s assessment of the universal waste regulatory \nfactors , we think that EPA\u2019s analysis does not consider other factors that are \nimportant for evaluating aerosol cans as a candidate for the program.  In \ndifferentiating the relative risk of these cans in comparison with other ha zardous \nwaste, EPA does not consider the fact that the public at large knows about the \nrisks of aerosol cans.  These materials are so ubiquitous that the primary risk of \nthese cans, ignitability, due to the pressurization and contents of these cans can \nbe assumed to be common knowledge.  This fact, above all other \nconsiderations, illustrates that these cans have a lower risk than other hazardous \nwastes .  \n-3 -\n20480658 -v1EPA also does not fully consider the regulatory burdens associated with \nmanaging aerosol cans as hazar dous waste.  Even if aerosol cans aremanaged \nas excluded hazardous waste \u2014for example, excluded scrap metal, these cans \nstill must be subject to the codified legitimacy criteria, which is a significant \nburden on their potential recycling.  Because the univ ersal waste program is not \na hazardous waste exclusion, the legitimacy criteria do not need to be evaluated \nfor aerosol cans being recycled as universal waste.  This factor alone is a \nsignificant benefit to managing aerosol cans as universal waste.  \nNotwi thstanding our general support for the addition of aerosol cans to the \nfederal universal waste program, we have significant concerns that EPA\u2019s \nproposal unnecessarily adds regulatory burdens to the management of these \nmaterials as universal waste.   In the proposal\u2019s preamble, the Agency notes that \ngenerators that punctu reand/or drain waste aerosol cans are exempt from \nRCRA permitting requirements if the activity is part of the recycling process.  83 \nFed. Reg. at 11656.  Nonetheless, EPA intends to codify m anagement standards \nin the current proposal requiring the use of a commercial device with attendant \nwritten procedures on its use, including procedures for spil land release \nresponses for handlers puncturing and draining aerosol cans.  Id.at 11666 -67.  \nWhile we can see the benefit of this requirement for large scale commercial \nentities that handle aerosol cans on behalf of many generators, generators that \nmanage their own aerosol cans should not be subject to this standard.  Forcing \ngenerators to choose be tween managing aerosol cans as fully hazardous waste \nwithout management standards or universal waste subject to management \nstandards will necessarily limit the relief provided by EPA in this rulemaking.  \nSince generators have been safely handling the punct uring and draining of cans \npursuant to the full hazardous waste regulations ,imposing these management \nstandards on purportedly streamlined universal waste standards seems \nunnecessary and counterproductive.  \nUSW AG also supports EPA\u2019s position that the uni versal waste \nmanagement standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal waste.  W hile aerosol cans are assumed \nto be of certain specific dimens ions, adopting this limitation c ould require that all \naerosol cans be weighed individually which would frustrate the streamlined \nmanagement standards.  This would be especially problematic for aerosol cans \ngenerated in the field at remote locations where scales might be inaccessible.  \nCans that did not meet this wei ght restriction would potentially be subject to full \nhazardous waste regulation and when managed together with universal waste \ncans would presumably subject entire loads of materials to full hazardous waste \nregulation.  This type of restriction could frust rate the entire regulatory scheme \nbeing proposed.  \n-4 -\n20480658 -v1In finalizing this regulatory program, USW AG also requests that EPA \nclarify the currently available management standards foraerosol cans that show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could caus e leakage under \nreasonably foreseeable conditions.   In the preamble of the proposal, EPA \nsuggests that these cans \u201cbe subject to full hazardous waste standards\u201d and not \nbe managed pursuant to the universal waste standards being proposed.  Id.at \n11660.  W hile we do not object to the exclusion of these cans from the scope of \nthe proposal, we request that EPA clarify that these cans can still be punctured \nand drained by generators where it is safe to do so.  By puncturing and draining \nthese cans, generators c an and often do eliminate potential leakage and remove \na risk associated with f uture management of these cans.  W e also strongly \nencourage the Agency to address what constitutes leakage from aerosol cans.  \nMany cans can have minor leaks such that the conte nts of the can are visible \noutside of the can.

Reg. 11654 (March 16, 2018).   USWAG is an \nassociation of electric and gas utilities, power producers and affiliated \nassociations and represents its members on, among other issues, the \nmanagement and recycling of solid and haza rdous wastes.  USW AG member\ncompanies regularly generate waste aerosol cans during the generation, \ntransmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas at a wide variety of \nlocations and in various quantities.  Adding aerosol cans to the RCRA unive rsal \nwaste program will directly impact the ma nagement and recycling of aerosol cans \nby our industry.  USWAG generally supports EPA\u2019s proposal which will reduce \nthe management burdens on the recycling and disposal of aerosol cans.  We\n                                                          \n1USW AG, formed in 1978, is an assoc iation of over one hundred and thirty electric \nutilities, power producers ,utility operating companies, and utility service companies \nlocated throughout the United States, including the Edison Electric Institute (\u201cEEI\u201d), the \nAmerican Gas Association (\u201cAGA\u201d ), the American Public Power Association (\u201cAPPA\u201d), \nand the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (\u201cNRECA\u201d). Together, US WAG \nmembers represent more than 73% of the total electric generating capacity of the United \nStates, and service more than 95% of the nation\u2019s consumers of electricity and 92% of \nthe nation\u2019s consumers of natural gas.\n-2 -\n20480658 -v1have concerns , howeve r,that the proposed management standards will limit the \nbenefits that would otherwise accrue from adding aerosol cans to the universal \nwaste program and will unnecessarily imposeregulatory burden son the \nrecycling and disposal of these materials.   \nAsan initial matter, USW AG firmly supports adding waste aerosol cans to \nthe RCRA universal waste program.

We agree with the overall analysis used to include aerosol cans in the Universal Waste \nregulations and agree that the proposed changes provide a clear and practical management system and will \nbenefit the  wide variety of establishments generating and managing waste aerosol cans.  \n \nDefinition of Aerosol Cans  \n \n EPA defines aerosol can as  follows : \u201cAerosol can means an intact container in which gas under pressure \nis used to aerate and dispense any material through a valve in the form of a spray or foam.\u201d  Stericycle \nrecommends expanding the definition to include the phrase \u201cany non- refillable\u201d  to better align w ith the  \nU.S. Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Regulations 49 CFR 171.8, which defines an \naerosol as \u201cany non -refillable receptacle containing a gas compressed, liquefied or dissolved under \npressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a nonpoisonous (other than a Division 6.1 Packing Group \nIII material) liquid, paste, or powder and fitted with a self -closing release device allowing the contents to \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstericycle .com be ejected by the gas.\"  Adding the clarifying term of \u201cany non- refillable\u201d to the definitio n of an aerosol \nwould make it clear as to what items the EPA intends to include in the Universal Waste regulations.  \n \nAlso, Stericycle would recommend that the Agency provide an expanded description and definition of \nwhat constitutes an \u201cintact  container \u201d The lack of definition of \u201cintact\u201d could lead to widely varying \ninterpretations, based upon the condition of the aerosol can.  For example, would any of these conditions \nlead to the aerosol container being considered not intact:  missing a cap, missing an actuator, dented can, \nrusted can, bulging can, missing/illegible label?   \n \n \nPart 273 Applicability \u2013 RCRA Hazardous Aerosol Cans  \n \nIn part 273, the Agency intends to exclude any aerosol cans that do not meet the definition of a RCRA \nhazardous waste. Part 273.6 (b)(2) says \u201cAn aerosol can is a hazardous waste if the aerosol can  exhibits \none or more of the  characteristics identified in part 261,  subpart C of this chapter or the aerosol  can \ncontains a substance that is listed in  part 261, subpart D of this chapter.\u201d   Although it is  understood that \nthe current structure of the Universal Waste regulations require EPA  to only include hazardous waste \naerosol  cans as Universal Waste, Stericycle would encourage the Agency to consider allowing non- RCRA \nhazardous waste regulated aerosol  cans to be handled and managed for disposal as Universal Waste.  It \nwould not be necessary to require  non-hazardous  aerosol cans to be managed under the Universal Waste \nregulations because of the limitations of the existing Universal Wast e regulatory structure .  However, non-\nhazardous and RCRA hazardous waste aerosol  cans are often managed through the same handling, \nprocessing, and disposal processes and facilities and allowing  empty aerosol cans to be managed as \nUniversal Waste could lead  to capturing more discarded aerosol cans  for recycling.   \nIt is stated in the preamble to the proposed rule that it is intended to ease the regulatory burden on the \nretail sector.  Aerosol cans represent one of the largest waste streams generated by the r etail sector.  \nDetermining if an aerosol product meets the definition of a RCRA hazardous waste can be very \nchallenging for the average retailer, considering the prevalence of retail products now offered/sold in an \naerosol format.  Removing this uncertaint y and decision  making process will ease the burden on the retai l \nsector and ensure that all aerosol cans are captured for recycling.  \n \nPart 273 Applicability \u2013 Empty Aerosol Cans  \n \nAlso under part 273, the Agency intends to exclude empty cans from those  that can be managed under the \nUniversal Waste regulations.  Part 273.6(b)( 3) says \u201cAerosol cans that meet the standard for empty \ncontainers under part 261.7 of this chapter\u201d .   Part 261.7(b)(2) defines an empty aerosol container as being \nempty as follows  \u201c(2) A container that has held a hazardous waste that is a compressed gas is empty \nwhen the pressure in the container approaches atmospheric.\u201d  Stericycle would encourage the Agency to \nallow empty aerosol cans to be managed under the Universal Waste regula tions.    \n \nStericycle assumes that empty aerosol cans are excluded from the Universal Waste regulations because \nempty aerosol cans do not meet the definition of a hazardous waste.  However, Stericycle believes that \nincluding empty aerosol cans in the Univer sal Waste regulations would actually encourage greater \namounts of aerosol can recycling .  No reliable methods exist  for a Generator to determine with a visual \ninspection whether or not the internal pressure of an aerosol can approaches atmospheric  pressure, so the \nonly method of ensuring no pressure remains is to puncture the aerosol can.   Many Generators do not \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstericycle .com want to puncture aerosol cans to avoid the additional regulatory and health and safety burdens associated \nwith that activity.  Even if an aerosol can seems empty, h ow does a Generator determine if the entire \namount of contents and propellant have been totally removed from the can, or if the actuator simply \nfailed?   \n \nAlso, maintaining  separate standards for empty and non -empty aerosols would require  Generators to have \ntwo separate accumulation containers  wherever waste aerosol cans are generated: one accumulation \ncontainer for empty aerosol cans and one accumulation container  for non- empty.  It is understood that the \nempty aerosol cans could be recycled as scrap metal, but there would be no harm in allowing empty \naerosols to be managed as Universal Waste.   This would also have the added environmental benefit of \nensuring that any residual propellants or contents leftover in an aerosol can that was thought to be empty \nwould be captured and managed through to proper disposal.   Any uncertainty on the part of a Generat or \nas to whether an aerosol can is empty , may lead to aerosol cans being sent to landfill disposal instead of \nrecycling.   However, including  empty aerosol cans would provide a clear decision process for Generators \nto include all  aerosol  cans --empty, full, or partially full --for proper handling and disposal as Universal \nWaste.  \n \nIt would not be necessary to require  empty aerosol cans to be managed under the Universal Waste \nregulations because Generators may still want to manage empty aerosol cans as scrap metal for recycling.  \nHowever, allowing  empty aerosol cans to be managed as Universal Waste could lead to captur ing more \ndiscarded aerosol  cans  for recycling.   \n \n \nAgain, overall Stericycle is in support of including waste aerosol cans in the Universal Waste rule and we \ndo hope that states would also adopt this position moving forward as well.

        "extracted_text": "Comments to Universal Waste Aerosol Can Proposed Rule  \n \n \nLea Neveri  \nDallas, Texas  \n \n \nComment 1 \nWhile comments were not requested, it is imperative t he agency clearly address the regulatory status of \nspent filter s from universal waste aerosol can puncturing operations . Upon generation, will  spent filter s \nonly be hazardous if they  exhibit a characteristic or can P- and U -codes apply? This should be codified in \n\u00a7273.13(e)(3) .   \n \n \nComment 2 \nThis comment is in response  to the proposed rule requiring a hazardous waste determination for empty, \npunctured universal waste aerosol cans.   \n \nIn the proposed \u00a7273.13(e)(3)  and \u00a7273.33(e)(3) , a handler who punctures and drains universal waste \naerosol cans must recycle the empty, pu nctured, aerosol cans. This  is in line with what is currently taking \nplace across the country. Generators routinely puncture and drain aerosol cans and manage the emptied \naerosol cans as scrap metal under the \u00a7261.6(a)(3)(ii) exemption. Per EPA guidance, t he puncturing \nprocess is an exempt form of hazardous waste treatment when the punctured aerosol cans are managed \nas scrap metal for recycle. [RO 11782] In the proposed \u00a7273.13(e)(3)(v)  and \u00a7273.33(e)(3)(v) , the handler \nis required to conduct a hazardous wa ste determination on the emptied aerosol cans. However, these \nemptied aerosol cans meet the scrap metal recycling exemption of \u00a7261.6(a)(3)(ii) which exempts the \nscrap metal from Parts 262 -270 which includes the hazardous waste determination of \u00a7262.11. [R O 11782, \n11806] Thus, the agency is proposing requiring a handler make a hazardous waste determination on \nsomething that is exempt from making a hazardous waste determination. A hazardous waste \ndetermination is not needed for the scrap metal going for recy cle, thus the proposed hazardous waste \ndetermination requirement for emptied aerosol cans is contradictory to the current regulation (and \nguidance) and needs to be removed. It would benefit the regulated community if EPA were to add a \nsentence clearly stating that a hazardous waste determination is not needed for the scrap metal being \nmanaged under the scrap metal exemption.  \n \nIn the preamble of th e proposed rule the agency on ly discussed making a hazardous waste determination \nfor the contents removed from the aerosol cans, not the emptied cans themselves. [83 FR 11661] It seems \nthe agency ma de an inadvertent mistake when it proposed requiring a hazardous waste determination \nfor the emptied aerosol cans  that will b e recycled . \n \nThe text of  \u00a7273.13(e)(3)(v) and \u00a7273.33(e)(3)(v) should read \u201cConduct a hazardous waste determination \non the contents removed from aerosol cans per 40 CFR 262.11. A hazardous waste determination is not \nneeded for  emptied aerosol can s being managed under 40 CFR 261.6(a)(3)(ii). Any hazardous waste \ngenerated as a result of puncturing and draining the aerosol can is subject to all applicable requirements \nof 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. The handler is conside red the generator of the hazardous waste and is \nsubject to 40 CFR part 262;\u201d . \n  \nComment 3  \nThis comment is in response to the proposed definition of aerosol can.  \n \nEPAs intent is to capture aerosol cans , not cylinders, under the universal waste program.

While I believe that aerosol can manufacturing should be more heavily regulated, taxed and discouraged, I do realize that a complete ban, although best for our environment, would be unrealistic. Increasing regulations to make the recycling of aerosol cans easier is one step toward a better future in the reduction of landfill waste.\n\nAlong with the new designation pertaining to recycling aerosol cans I would like to suggest that more effort should be made by the EPA in educating the public on the Universal Waste Regulations. In general not enough people care about how to recycle hazardous items, such as batteries. If the general public was more aware of how easy and beneficial it is to properly dispose of these types of items so they do not go to landfills and contaminate our soils I believe they would be more inclined to participate.\n\nMegan Swarthout",

    "comment_text": "As a student in Pratt Institute's Graduate Center for Planning and the Environment I would like to commend the EPA for its efforts in analyzing the impacts and acknowledging the benefits of adding hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. I would hope that this proposed rule from the EPA also sees this as an opportunity to address the environment health inequities that low income and often predominantely people of color communities face, specifically in relation to the proximity to landfills and combustors.\n\nBelow I have identified some ideas and opportunities to do address this:\n\n(1) As the proposed rule states, it hopes to \"encourage the development of municipal and commercial programs to reduce the quantity of these wastes going to municipal solid waste landfills or combustors\". I would like to expand on this point and recommend that the development of municipal and commercial programs be prioritized in above said communities as well as concentrated places where there is a high removal of aerosol cans such as manufacturing plant or retail store to help mitigate environment health impacts faster.\n\n(2) As aerosol cans are commonly used by the manufacturing industry, retail sector, and from private citizens such as ourselves, I would use this as an opportunity to increase fines and penalties for individuals or groups that continue to inappropriately dispose of aerosol cans. As this proposed rule reduces the barriers to the proper removal of aersol cans, it should be acknowledged that the continuation of adding to landfills reduces the strength of the rule and potential benefits outlined in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA).\n\n(3) As requested by the EPA for comment, there should not be a size limitation of aerosol cans to help reduce unnecessary environmental impacts in the disposable and processing of aerosol cans. As long as aerosol cans larger than twenty four ounces are in production, there should be an effort to recycle all sizes to remove the largest quantity from landfills and combustors as possible. In consistency with the four states (California, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah) that already have enacted waste programs for aerosol cans, the EPA should not have a size limitation. This promotes universality in regulation and strengthens procedure as there are less caveats for agencies that carry out enforcement to follow.\n\nUltimately, it should be the goal of the EPA to safeguard the natural environment and hold society accountable of how it impacts the natural environment. One of the major sources to environmental derogation is landfills and the poisoning of soil and inadvertently the air and our water supply. The recycling of aerosol cans offers us an opportunity to reduce the negative impact of landfills and improve the environmental health of people who have face a disproportionate impact from them.",

Adding aerosol cans to the RCRA universal \nwaste program will directly impact the management and recycling of aerosol cans \nby our industry. USWAG generally supports EPA's proposal which will reduce \nthe management burdens on the recycling and disposal of aerosol cans. We \n1  USWAG, formed in 1978, is an association of over one hundred and thirty electric \nutilities, power producers, utility operating companies, and utility service companies \nlocated throughout the United States, including the Edison Electric Institute (\"EEI\"), the \nAmerican Gas Association (\"AGA\"), the American Public Power Association (APPK), \nand the National Rural Eiectric -Cooperative Association (\"NRECK). Together, USWAG \nmembers represent more than 73% of the total electric generating capacity of the United \nStates, and service more than 95% of the nation's consumers of electricity and 92% of \nthe nation's consumers of natural gas. \t\nPOSTNI)..N,RiCqD \ngRf 1 tilt 20480658-v1 \t\nIIPA DOCKET CENTER \n2 \nhave concerns, however, that the proposed management standards will limit the \nbenefits that would otherwise accrue from adding aerosol cans to the universal \nwaste program and will unnecessarily impose regulatory burdens on the \nrecycling and disposal of these materials. \nAs an initial matter, USWAG firmly supports adding waste aerosol cans to \nthe RCRA universal waste program. We agree that reducing the regulatory \nburdens on aerosol cans that otherwise would be subject to full RCRA hazardous \nwaste regulation will significantly improve the collection and recycling of these \ncans. Much like the universal waste program has accomplished for other waste \nstreams, households and very small quantity generators likely will decide either \nto accumulate their own wastes in larger amounts or bring these materials to \ncollection centers which both diverts these wastes from being disposed of in \nmunicipal solid waste landfills and allows for the accumulation of universal \nwastes facilitating recycling. States successful experiences with the \nmanagement of aerosol cans as universal waste and the past success of the \nfederal universal waste program for other materials is powerful evidence that \nsimilar benefits will accrue if EPA adds aerosol cans to the federal program. \nFurthermore, if EPA adds these materials to the universal waste program, \ngenerators that otherwise would be classified as either small or large quantity \ngenerators would be allowed to accumulate larger volumes of these cans for up \nto one year which will significantly facilitate recycling. USWAG members \ngenerate aerosol cans at a wide variety of sites ranging from utility manholes to \nlarge power plants. Providing an option for the accumulation of these wastes at \ncentral collection points significantly reduces the regulatory burdens associated \nwith managing these disparate but ubiquitous wastes. As is true for virtually all \nrecycling, the collection of larger volumes of materials reduces the burden on \nmanaging and transporting aerosol cans being recycled. \nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA provides a discussion of the \nappropriateness of adding aerosol cans to the federal universal waste program \nand how these materials meet the regulatory criteria established for this program. \nWhile USWAG agrees with EPA's assessment of the universal waste regula .tory \nfactors, we think that EPA's analysis does not consider other factors that are \nimportant for evaluating aerosol cans as a candidate for the program. In \ndifferentiating the relative risk of these cans in comparison with other hazardous \nwaste, EPA does not consider the fact that the public at large knows about the \nrisks of aerosol cans. These materials are so ubiquitous that the primary risk of \nthese cans, ignitability, due to the pressurization and contents of these cans can \nbe assumed to be common knowledge. This fact, above all other \nconsiderations, illustrates that these cans have a lower risk than other hazardous \nwastes. \n20480658-v1 p. 2 \n3 \nEPA also does not fully consider the regulatory burdens associated with \nmanaging aerosol cans as hazardous waste. Even if aerosol cans are managed \nas excluded hazardous waste\u2014for example, excluded scrap metal, these cans \nstill must be subject to the codified legitimacy criteria, which is a significant \nburden on their potential recycling. Because the universal waste program is not \na hazardous waste exclusion, the legitimacy criteria do not need to be evaluated \nfor aerosol cans being recycled as universal waste. This factor alone is a \nsignificant benefit to managing aerosol cans as universal waste. \nNotwithstanding our general support for the addition of aerosol cans to the \nfederal universal waste program, we have significant concerns that EPA's \nproposal unnecessarily adds regulatory burdens to the management of these \nmaterials as universal waste. In the proposal's preamble, the Agency notes that \ngenerators that puncture and/or drain waste aerosol cans are exempt from \nRCRA permitting requirements if the activity is part of the recycling process. 83 \nFed. Reg. at 11656. Nonetheless, EPA intends to codify management standards \nin the current proposal requiring the use of a commercial device with attendant \nwritten procedures on its use, including procedures for spill and release \nresponses for handlers puncturing and draining aerosol cans. Id. at 11666-67. \nWhile we can see the benefit of this requirement for large scale commercial \nentities that handle aerosol cans on behalf of many generators, generators that \nmanage their own aerosol cans should not be subject to this standard. Forcing \ngenerators to choose between managing aerosol cans as fully hazardous waste \nwithout management standards or universal waste subject to management \nstandards will necessarily limit the relief provided by EPA in this rulemaking. \nSince generators have been safely handling the puncturing and draining of cans \npursuant to the full hazardous waste regulations, imposing these management \nstandards on purportedly streamlined universal waste standards seems \nunnecessary and counterproductive. \nUSWAG also supports EPA's position that the universal waste \nmanagement standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal waste. While aerosol cans are assumed \nto be of certain specific dimensions, adopting this limitation could require that all \naerosol cans be weighed individually which would frustrate the streamlined \nmanagement standards. This would be especially problematic for aerosol cans \ngenerated in the field at remote locations where scales might be inaccessible. \nCans that did not meet this weight restriction would potentially be subject to full \nhazardous waste regulation and when managed together with universal waste \ncans would presumably subject entire loads of materials to full hazardous waste \nregulation. This type of restriction could frustrate the entire regulatory scheme \nbeing proposed. \n20480658-v1 P. 3  \n4 \nin finalizing this regulatory program, USWAG also requests that EPA \nclarify the currently available management standards for aerosol cans that show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under \nreasonably foreseeable conditions. In the preamble of the proposal, EPA \nsuggets that these cans \"be subject to full hazardous waste standards'' and not \nbe mahaged pursuant to thE. universal waste standards being propos rad. Id. at \n11660. While we do not object to the exclusion of these cans fro-nii the scope of \nthe proposal, we request thEt EPA clarify that these cans ca M still be punctured \nand drained by generators whv -e it is safe to do so. By p lActuring and draining \nthese cans, generators can and often do eliminate poter itial leakage and remove \na ri4k associated with future management of these cams. We also strongly \nencourage the Agency to address what constitutes iieakage from aerosol cans. \nMahy r:ans can have min. \\` leaks such that the contents of the can are visible \noutside qf the can. Thi.9 can occur even from no rmal use and often does not \nindicate that tiiNQ aerosol can's qbility to contain l ts contents has been \ncompromised.

We agree that reducing the regulatory \nburdens on aerosol cans that otherwise would be subject to full RCRA hazardous \nwaste regulation will significantly improve the collection and recycling of these \ncans. Much like the universal waste program has accomplished for other waste \nstreams, households and very small quantity generators likely will decide either \nto accumulate their own wastes in larger amounts or bring these materials to \ncollection centers which both diverts these wastes from being disposed of in \nmunicipal solid waste landfills and allows for the accumulation of universal \nwastes facilitating recycling. States successful experiences with the \nmanagement of aerosol cans as universal waste and the past success of the \nfederal universal waste program for other materials is powerful evidence that \nsimilar benefits will accrue if EPA adds aerosol cans to the federal program. \nFurthermore, if EPA adds these materials to the universal waste program, \ngenerators that otherwise would be classified as either small or large quantity \ngenerators would be allowed to accumulate larger volumes of these cans for up \nto one year which will significantly facilitate recycling. USWAG members \ngenerate aerosol cans at a wide variety of sites ranging from utility manholes to \nlarge power plants. Providing an option for the accumulation of these wastes at \ncentral collection points significantly reduces the regulatory burdens associated \nwith managing these disparate but ubiquitous wastes. As is true for virtually all \nrecycling, the collection of larger volumes of materials reduces the burden on \nmanaging and transporting aerosol cans being recycled. \nIn the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA provides a discussion of the \nappropriateness of adding aerosol cans to the federal universal waste program \nand how these materials meet the regulatory criteria established for this program. \nWhile USWAG agrees with EPA's assessment of the universal waste regula .tory \nfactors, we think that EPA's analysis does not consider other factors that are \nimportant for evaluating aerosol cans as a candidate for the program. In \ndifferentiating the relative risk of these cans in comparison with other hazardous \nwaste, EPA does not consider the fact that the public at large knows about the \nrisks of aerosol cans. These materials are so ubiquitous that the primary risk of \nthese cans, ignitability, due to the pressurization and contents of these cans can \nbe assumed to be common knowledge. This fact, above all other \nconsiderations, illustrates that these cans have a lower risk than other hazardous \nwastes. \n20480658-v1 p. 2 \n3 \nEPA also does not fully consider the regulatory burdens associated with \nmanaging aerosol cans as hazardous waste. Even if aerosol cans are managed \nas excluded hazardous waste\u2014for example, excluded scrap metal, these cans \nstill must be subject to the codified legitimacy criteria, which is a significant \nburden on their potential recycling. Because the universal waste program is not \na hazardous waste exclusion, the legitimacy criteria do not need to be evaluated \nfor aerosol cans being recycled as universal waste. This factor alone is a \nsignificant benefit to managing aerosol cans as universal waste. \nNotwithstanding our general support for the addition of aerosol cans to the \nfederal universal waste program, we have significant concerns that EPA's \nproposal unnecessarily adds regulatory burdens to the management of these \nmaterials as universal waste. In the proposal's preamble, the Agency notes that \ngenerators that puncture and/or drain waste aerosol cans are exempt from \nRCRA permitting requirements if the activity is part of the recycling process. 83 \nFed. Reg. at 11656. Nonetheless, EPA intends to codify management standards \nin the current proposal requiring the use of a commercial device with attendant \nwritten procedures on its use, including procedures for spill and release \nresponses for handlers puncturing and draining aerosol cans. Id. at 11666-67. \nWhile we can see the benefit of this requirement for large scale commercial \nentities that handle aerosol cans on behalf of many generators, generators that \nmanage their own aerosol cans should not be subject to this standard. Forcing \ngenerators to choose between managing aerosol cans as fully hazardous waste \nwithout management standards or universal waste subject to management \nstandards will necessarily limit the relief provided by EPA in this rulemaking. \nSince generators have been safely handling the puncturing and draining of cans \npursuant to the full hazardous waste regulations, imposing these management \nstandards on purportedly streamlined universal waste standards seems \nunnecessary and counterproductive. \nUSWAG also supports EPA's position that the universal waste \nmanagement standards should not adopt a limitation on the weight of cans \nauthorized to be managed as universal waste. While aerosol cans are assumed \nto be of certain specific dimensions, adopting this limitation could require that all \naerosol cans be weighed individually which would frustrate the streamlined \nmanagement standards. This would be especially problematic for aerosol cans \ngenerated in the field at remote locations where scales might be inaccessible. \nCans that did not meet this weight restriction would potentially be subject to full \nhazardous waste regulation and when managed together with universal waste \ncans would presumably subject entire loads of materials to full hazardous waste \nregulation. This type of restriction could frustrate the entire regulatory scheme \nbeing proposed. \n20480658-v1 P. 3  \n4 \nin finalizing this regulatory program, USWAG also requests that EPA \nclarify the currently available management standards for aerosol cans that show \nevidence of leakage, spillage, or damage that could cause leakage under \nreasonably foreseeable conditions. In the preamble of the proposal, EPA \nsuggets that these cans \"be subject to full hazardous waste standards'' and not \nbe mahaged pursuant to thE. universal waste standards being propos rad. Id. at \n11660. While we do not object to the exclusion of these cans fro-nii the scope of \nthe proposal, we request thEt EPA clarify that these cans ca M still be punctured \nand drained by generators whv -e it is safe to do so. By p lActuring and draining \nthese cans, generators can and often do eliminate poter itial leakage and remove \na ri4k associated with future management of these cams.
