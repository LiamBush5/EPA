If this rule were to be adopted, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program established by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste aerosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimated that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The CPSA also estimated..."

The rule will also make it easier for retailers to transport and dispose of the cans, which could save them money. Overall I think this rule will be very beneficial to the environment and businesses that handle aerosol cans."

Increasing regulations to make the recycling of aerosol cans easier is one step toward a better future in the reduction of landfill waste.\n\nAlong with the new desi..."
