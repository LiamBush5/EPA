I strongly agree that adding hazardous

Its funny you guys always say you are going to reduce costs and that the univers
al waste classification eases the regulatory burden. The US EPA must really not 
monitor the waste industry and costs associated. Universal wastes now are some o
f the highest costs for generators to incur. A drum of aerosol cans currently wi
ll cost around $45 for bulk customers and a typical end-user cost is about $100 
per drum. Now if you make aerosols a universal waste there will be companies tha

Asarco, headquartered in Tucson AZ, is an integrated copper mining, smelting, an

Waste Proposed Rule:

We commend the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for t
aking this step of including aerosol cans in the Universal Waste Regulation of 4
0 CFR Part 273. Asarco agrees with the EPA that managing aerosol can as Universa
l Waste will reduce the number of aerosol cans in landfills, will increase the v

Dear Tracy Atagi and Tiffany Kollar,

I am a toxicologist and public health prof

posed rule serves to protect environmental and human health, my concern is in re
gards to Section IV Part B2 Proposed Requirements and Request for Comment on Pun

Overall, I believe that the proposed rule to include hazardous aerosol cans on t
he universal waste list under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is a go
od idea. The rule will help enhance personal safety when disposing of hazardous 
aerosol cans and prevent solid waste in the form of aerosol cans from making it 
into non-hazardous landfills.

This proposal will help small quantity generators remain small quantity generato
rs. It will also eliminate employee exposure to the hazards associated with punc
turing aerosol cans containing flammable and other hazardous substances. I belie
ve this proposed rule will help protect the environment and improve employee saf

This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopt
ed, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program e
stablished by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste ae
rosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of 
how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estima

Dear Tracy Atagi and Tiffany Kollar,

I am a toxicologist and public health prof
essional and I am in favor of this proposed rule. While I may agree that the pro
posed rule serves to protect environmental and human health, my concern is in re
gards to Section IV Part B2 Proposed Requirements and Request for Comment on Pun
cturing and Draining at Small and Large Quantity Handlers. In this section, EPA 
acknowledges that simplifying disposal procedures for aerosol cans will lead to 
a greater number and...

I believe this regulation would be great for the environment, and that if implem
ented it would be a major improvement to the waste system in our country. I have
 a few concerns and questions about the actual process of adding aerosol cans to
 the universal waste program, but ultimately I support the regulation and think 
it will be beneficial for our country.

Overall, I believe that the proposed rule to include hazardous aerosol cans on t
he universal waste list under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is a go
od idea. The rule will help enhance personal safety when disposing of hazardous 
aerosol cans and prevent solid waste in the form of aerosol cans from making it 
into non-hazardous landfills.

This proposal will help small quantity generators remain small quantity generato
rs. It will also eliminate employee exposure to the hazards associated with punc
turing aerosol cans containing flammable and other hazardous substances. I belie
ve this proposed rule will help protect the environment and improve employee saf
ety.

Its funny you guys always say you are going to reduce costs and that the univers
al waste classification eases the regulatory burden. The US EPA must really not 
monitor the waste industry and costs associated. Universal wastes now are some o
f the highest costs for generators to incur. A drum of aerosol cans currently wi
ll cost around $45 for bulk customers and a typical end-user cost is about $100 
per drum. Now if you make aerosols a universal waste there will be companies tha

This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopt
ed, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program e
stablished by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste ae
rosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of 
how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estima
ted that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The
 CPSA also estimated...

My name is Gustave Njapon, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Lafayett

 the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule of increasing recycling by 
adding Aerosol cans to universal waste regulations. Aerosols are common househol

aint. The principal matter for why they are hard to recycle is that the pressuri

Dear Docket,

It is my belief that the addition of hazardous aerosol can waste t
o the universal waste program would successfully provide both incentive by aware
ness and ability for many people which going forward would work to greatly decre
ase the number of potentially dangerous and wasteful aerosol cans that are impro
perly disposed of in our country today. This effort aligns with both the common 
interest of the public for decreased impact on landfills and increased safety fr
