Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0016

Text: The threat of regulation can induce companies to behave in reactive ways, distorting markets and creating economic inefficiency, compounding stagnation. If businesses cannot predict regulations, they can not expand. The modern regulation environment based on erroneous and flawed reports, makes business more risk averse. Over-regulation and its close ally uncertainty cut down on breakthroughs, slows growth. The greatness of our unique nation hinges on the fundamental purpose of the government to ...

Text: ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. supports the Environmental Protection Agency proposal to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the list of universal wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations. This proposed change, once finalized, will benefit a wide variety of establishments generating and managing aerosol cans, and lays out a clear, practical system for handling discarded aerosol cans.

Analysis: The comment does not provide specific sections of the "Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to Universal Waste Regulations" document. However, it generally refers to the proposal of adding hazardous waste aerosol cans to the list of universal wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulations. Therefore, the comment could be related to the overall proposal and its implications but does not address specific sections.

Text: I am in favor of this idea. I believe it will benefit many companies as well as the environment. This rule will make it easier for people to recycle aerosol cans, which will lead to fewer cans in the landfill. The rule will also make it easier for retailers to transport and dispose of the cans, which could save them money. Overall I think this rule will be very beneficial to the environment and businesses that handle aerosol cans.

Text: Dear EPA

I am pleased to see that the EPA is taking steps to try to ensure a better system for the collection and recycling of aerosol cans. While I believe that aerosol can manufacturing should be more heavily regulated, taxed and discouraged, I do realize that a complete ban, although best for our environment, would be unrealistic. Increasing regulations to make the recycling of aerosol cans easier is one step toward a better future in the reduction of landfill waste.

Text: Note: I am a student at Duke University studying environmental science, and I'm writing this comment as an assignment for a class on environmental policy.

The use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers and the public due to their flammability, pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety Management Group, 2013). They are also demonstrably harmful to public health and the environment due to their effects on the atmosphere and the leaching of harmful c...

Text: Note: I am a student at Duke University studying environmental science, and I'm writing this comment as an assignment for a class on environmental policy.

The use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers and the public due to their flammability, pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety Management Group, 2013). They are also demonstrably harmful to public health and the environment due to their effects on the atmosphere and the leaching of harmful c...

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0038

Text: Dear Docket,

It is my belief that the addition of hazardous aerosol can waste to the universal waste program would successfully provide both incentive by awareness and ability for many people which going forward would work to greatly decrease the number of potentially dangerous and wasteful aerosol cans that are improperly disposed of in our country today. This effort aligns with both the common interest of the public for decreased impact on landfills and increased safety from the potential rel...

Text: I support the proposal to add hazardous waste aerosol cans to the universal waste program under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations. Regulating the generation, transportation, treatment, recycling, and disposal of hazardous waste aerosol cans must be considered to prevent additional hazardous waste from entering into the solid waste landfill.

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0018

Text: This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopted, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program established by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste aerosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimated that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The CPSA also estimated...

Text: Its funny you guys always say you are going to reduce costs and that the universal waste classification eases the regulatory burden. The US EPA must really not monitor the waste industry and costs associated. Universal wastes now are some of the highest costs for generators to incur. A drum of aerosol cans currently will cost around $45 for bulk customers and a typical end-user cost is about $100 per drum. Now if you make aerosols a universal waste there will be companies that will emerge and sa...

Text: This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopted, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program established by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste aerosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimated that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The CPSA also estimated...

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0023

Text: This proposal will help small quantity generators remain small quantity generators. It will also eliminate employee exposure to the hazards associated with puncturing aerosol cans containing flammable and other hazardous substances. I believe this proposed rule will help protect the environment and improve employee safety.

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0042

Text: Its funny you guys always say you are going to reduce costs and that the universal waste classification eases the regulatory burden. The US EPA must really not monitor the waste industry and costs associated. Universal wastes now are some of the highest costs for generators to incur. A drum of aerosol cans currently will cost around $45 for bulk customers and a typical end-user cost is about $100 per drum. Now if you make aerosols a universal waste there will be companies that will emerge and sa...

Text: Re: Increasing Recycling: Adding Aerosol Cans to the Universal Waste Regulations, Docket ID Number EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463, FRL-9975-44-OLEM

Many entities will manage aerosol can puncture stations as satellite accumulation areas. Under 40 C.F.R. 262.15(a), satellite accumulation areas must be at or near any point of generation where wastes initially accumulate and under the control of the operator of the process generating the waste. I request clarification on how these rules would apply to punct...

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0018

Text: This proposed rule should be earnestly considered. If this rule were to be adopted, hazardous waste aerosol cans would be added to the universal waste program established by the EPA. The reason why the EPA feels as though hazardous waste aerosol cans should be added to the federal universal waste program is because of how much they are being used. The Consumer Specialty Products Association estimated that 3.82 billion aerosol cans were filled in the United States in 2015. The CPSA also estimated...

Text: My name is Gustave Njapon, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Lafayette College. I write to inform the governing body that I am in favor of supporting the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed rule of increasing recycling by adding Aerosol cans to universal waste regulations. Aerosols are common household items as they are used to store everything from food to bathroom products to paint. The principal matter for why they are hard to recycle is that the pressurized air inside and p...

The use and disposal of aerosol cans poses numerous health and safety risks to workers and the public due to their flammability, pressurized contents, and toxic materials (Safety Management Group, 2013). They are also demonstrably harmful to public health and the environment due to their effects on the atmosphere and the leaching of harmful c...

Comment EPA-HQ-OLEM-2017-0463-0038

Text: Dear Docket,

It is my belief that the addition of hazardous aerosol can waste to the universal waste program would successfully provide both incentive by awareness and ability for many people which going forward would work to greatly decrease the number of potentially dangerous and wasteful aerosol cans that are improperly disposed of in our country today. This effort aligns with both the common interest of the public for decreased impact on landfills and increased safety from the potential rel...
